Paul Roux, Christine Passerieux and Marie-Josée Fleury

# Background

Needs and service performance assessment are key components in improving recovery among individuals with mental disorders.

# Aims

To test the role of service performance as a mediating factor between severity of patients' needs and outcomes.

# Method

A total of 339 adults with mental disorders were interviewed. A mediation analysis between severity of needs, service performance (adequacy of help, continuity of care and recovery orientation of services) and outcomes (personal recovery and quality of life) was carried out using structural equation modelling.

# Results

The structural equation model provided a good fit with

the data. An increase in needs was associated with lower service performance and worse outcomes, whereas higher service performance was associated with better outcomes. Service performance partially mediated the effect of patient needs on outcomes.

# Conclusions

Poorer service performance has a negative impact on outcomes for patients with the highest needs. Ensuring more efficient services for patients with high needs may help improve their recovery and quality of life.

Mental healthcare reforms in the 2000s have promoted the transfer of treatment and follow-up for individuals with mental disorders to the community, as an alternative to hospital services. In the context of this shifting paradigm in mental healthcare, the Quebec Health Ministry (Canada) launched a Mental Health Action Plan in 2005 that supported the strengthening of community mental healthcare services and promoted recovery best practices to improve quality of life (QoL).2 Recovery has been defined as 'a deeply personal, unique process of changing one's attitudes, values, feelings, goals, skills, and/or roles . . . it is a way of living a satisfying, hopeful, and contributing life even with limitations caused by illness.3 Most high-income countries have engaged in mental health system reform over the past two decades in order to improve service performance by increasing continuity and accessibility of services, and adopting innovations like recovery-oriented practices to better respond to client needs. The goal of the reform under study was to enhance the recovery orientation of services by acknowledging that individuals with mental disorders should play a central role in treatment decisions and service orientation. Needs assessment is becoming a key component in measuring recovery among individuals with mental disorders.4 Knowing more about the relationship between patient needs and service performance may inform the development of better treatment plans and help improve patient outcomes like recovery and QoL. Studies have explored relationships between needs, service performance and outcomes; yet, to our knowledge, no research to date has studied these three components simultaneously.

This study represents a first step in the evaluation of this reform within the theory of change (ToC) theoretical framework. ToC provides a conceptual framework for generating knowledge about the extent to which reform is effective in specific local contexts.6 ToC allows us to generate causal pathways that describe how specific elements in organisational change may be expected to achieve the desired impact within particular settings. The first step in developing a ToC model is to identify inputs: for the present study inputs were defined as the needs of patients with mental disorders. Second, the outcomes targeted by services are defined; here, quality of life and personal recovery were identified as the ultimate aims of mental healthcare according to the recovery model.5 Finally, ToC requires identification of preconditions for achieving the desired outcomes. A number of factors may influence service performance in the context of system reform, for example shifting financial or human resources, leadership, interorganisational collaboration. This study hypothesised that the reorientation of services toward recovery, as well as improved continuity of care and adequacy of help received (i.e. the ability of providers to meet patient needs) were preconditions for enhancing recovery and QoL in patients. The study favoured subjective measures of service performance from a patient, rather than professional, perspective and eschewed other proxy measures for service performances such as administrative data (for example, frequency of visits to specialised mental health services, delay between hospital discharge and initial out-patient treatment), as these administrative measures, although considered objective, are weakly related to improved outcomes.10 To our knowledge, no research to date has studied the putative mediational role of service performance between patient needs and outcomes. The objective of the current study was to develop and validate a ToC pathway that may explain the impact of the Quebec reform in terms of patient perceptions of their needs, service performance for the services they used, and patient outcomes, using structural equation modelling (SEM).

# Definition of the model

Figure 1 presents a predictive model for the mediating role of service performance in mental healthcare based on the hypothesis

that the negative impact of patient needs on outcomes will be partially mediated by a decrease in service performance.

#### Definition of latent variables

Quality of life (QoL) and recovery were indicator variables of the latent variable outcome: these two dimensions usually correlate with one another.11 The second latent variable was service performance, which included adequacy of help, continuity of care and recovery orientation of services. Research suggests that these three indicator variables are closely related. For example, meeting patient needs is a key quality dimension in mental health services.12 The quality of services also relies heavily on recoverybased practice13 and continuity of mental healthcare. 14 Continuity of care is enhanced when the philosophy of care fits the recovery paradigm15 and is usually greater when mental health services meet patient needs more adequately.16 Stakeholders often consider that providing adequate help by meeting patient needs after discharge is one component of care that promotes the recovery orientation of services.12

#### Relationship between latent variables

Greater need for care is usually associated with worse outcomes for individuals with mental disorders, in terms of QoL17 and recovery.18 Needs may also have a detrimental effect on service performance: greater problem severity in relation to mental health correlated with lower continuity of care on both patient- and observer-rated scales.19 Moreover, the adequacy of help provided by services decreased with more severe mental health needs.20 Finally, staff-patient agreement on needs was negatively associated with severity of needs.21 Given that staff-patient consensus regarding service needs is a crucial component in recovery-oriented services, this result is compatible with the hypothesis that severity of needs will be negatively associated with a recovery orientation in services.

Service performance is crucial in improving patient outcomes. First, adequacy of help is positively associated with recovery in individuals with severe mental disorders. For example, self-reported unmet needs, which suggest inadequacy of help, are associated with lower QoL in patients with severe mental disorders, even after controlling for the confounding effect of met needs.22 Second, continuity of care is associated with better QoL and better community functioning in individuals with severe mental disorders.19 Finally, recovery-oriented services have been associated with better QoL and recovery. In sum, we developed the following hypotheses for the present study: patient needs will be negatively associated with outcomes; patient needs will be negatively associated with service performance; service performance will be positively associated with outcomes.

#### Study design and network characteristics

This study used a cross-sectional design. The study population included adults with mental disorders in Quebec who were followed in four local mental health service networks in different geographical areas: three networks were located in urban areas including the two most populous cities in Quebec, and one in a semi-urban area. Each local mental health service network included a hospital department of psychiatry and a multidisciplinary mental health primary care team (an out-patient team composed of psychosocial clinicians, general practitioners and psychiatrists). The networks also included community-based mental health agencies (for example, crisis centres, day centres, self-help groups and employment integration programmes), general practitioners and psychologists practising in private clinics, and community mental health housing resources (such as intermediary residences, foster homes).

#### Participants

To participate in the study, participants had to be between 18 and 70 years old and diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, or other conditions including mood, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, personality, attention-deficit hyperactivity or stressor-related disorders according to the DSM-V.23 This broad diagnostic spectrum ensured the representation of patients with a diversity of needs. The study excluded individuals who had been admitted

512

to hospital in the 3 months prior to the study, or who were too clinically unstable to allow for reliable data collection. The clinical stability and the ability to give fully informed consent were assessed by clinicians and the research team, which included psychiatrists. The investigators checked whether patients were capable of completing the full data collection process, and of comprehending and retaining information about the research. Individuals with a severe intellectual deficit were also excluded, as well as those receiving involuntary psychiatric treatment under judicial order, who may have been unable to provide informed consent for participation in the study.

Various recruitment strategies were used, including selfreferral in response to posters displayed at hospitals or health and social service centres. Information sessions were held, and flyers explaining the project produced for mental healthcare providers and housing resources staff in the mental health networks. The research team worked closely with an advisory committee comprised of decision makers from the mental health networks for the recruitment and data-collection phases. Data were collected from June 2013 to August 2014. Professional interviewers trained by the research team conducted two 90 min interviews at 1-week intervals with each participant. The interviewers maintained close contact with the research team to ensure quality data collection. Participants other than self-referrals were contacted by their primary healthcare provider, who gauged their interest in participating in the study and referred potential participants to the research team. After the study was described to them, participants were required to sign a consent form. The multisite study protocol was approved by the Ethics Board of the Douglas Mental Health University Institute (reference number: 07/35). Participants were required to give permission for the research team to access their medical records.

#### Measures

Five questionnaires were used to collect data. Patient needs and adequacy of help received were assessed using the Montreal Assessment of Needs Questionnaire (MANQ),24 which was derived from the Camberwell Assessment of Needs (CAN).25 The MANQ added four areas of need (adaptation to stress, social exclusion, involvement in treatment decisions and job integration) to the 22 areas of need established by the CAN, for a total of 26. While the CAN measures the severity of needs and adequacy of help received based on three ordinal scale questions, the MANQ uses three analogical scales, ranging from 0 to 10, identifying more precisely each of 26 possible areas of need (10, greatest severity or adequacy), and enhancing data variability. Whereas ratings on the CAN are usually provided by professionals, patient needs in this study were assessed by participants themselves using the MANQ, with the help of interviewers. As such, the response modality of the MANQ represents a better fit with the recovery perspective than that of the CAN. Another improvement in the MANQ over the CAN concerns the clear analytical distinction in the MANQ between severity of needs and adequacy of help received. The CAN categorises needs in terms of: 'no need', 'met need' and 'unmet need', which conflates the severity of need with the adequacy of help to meet the need. By contrast, the MANQ focuses on severity of need as the intensity of need, irrespective of whether the need was met or not.

A total score for severity of needs was computed for each participant by summing the severity scores for all areas of need (range 0-260). The MANQ severity of needs measure has been validated for test-retest reliability (kappa coefficient ranged from 0.74 to 1.00); and interrater reliability (kappa coefficient ranged from 0.79 to 1.00). The factorial structure and convergent validity

with other instruments have also been established for the MANQ.24,26

Service performance was evaluated using three standardised instruments: the MANQ measured adequacy of help received from both qualitative (type of support) and quantitative (amount of support) perspectives using two separate analogical scales. An adjusted score for adequacy of help received was computed for each participant by summing the two adequacy scores for all areas of need (range 0–520) and then dividing this overall score by the number of needs with a severity greater than 0. For example, an individual reporting two needs, one with a severity of 5, a quantitative adequacy of 4 and a qualitative adequacy of 3, and the other with a severity of 8, a quantitative adequacy of 2 and a qualitative adequacy of 1 would have a severity score of 13 and an adjusted adequacy of help received of 5. The introduction of this adjustment measure was necessary given significant variation in the number of reported needs.20 Adequacy of help received for the MANQ has been validated for internal consistency (Cronbach alpha x = 0.91, see online supplement DS1) and for convergent validity with the CAN.24 All other scales used to assess service performance were ordinal self-report instruments. Continuity of care was measured with the Alberta Continuity of Services Scale for Mental Health (ACSS, 43 items, five Likert-scale response levels, Cronbach's α=0.78-0.92).27 Recovery-orientation of services was evaluated with the Recovery Self-Assessment Scale, revised person-in-recovery version (RSA-R-PIR, 32 items, five Likert-scale response levels, Cronbach alpha α=0.94).28

Outcomes were evaluated with two standardised instruments: QoL was assessed with the Satisfaction with Life Domains Scale (SLDS, 20 items, seven Likert-scale response levels, Cronbach's α = 0.92);29 personal recovery was assessed with the Recovery Assessment Scale (RAS, 41 items, five Likert-scale response levels, Cronbach's α=0.76-0.97).30

#### Statistical analyses

First, zero-order correlations between each measure were performed and Pearson's correlation coefficients calculated. The statistical significance of each test was computed from standard error estimates using the bootstrap method with 2000 iterations. We then performed an SEM and mediation analysis to examine the relationships among needs, service performance and outcomes, using the lavaan package31 of R statistical software (version 3.2.2). The required sample size for completing SEM analysis is a minimum of five participants for each estimated parameter.32 In this study, 15 parameters were estimated, requiring a minimum of 75 participants. Factor loadings were used to specify the association between the unobservable constructs (latent variables) and their theoretically related measures (indicator variables). Regression analyses determined the relationships among latent variables and were indexed by standardised path coefficients. The independent variable, needs, was calculated as the total score for severity of needs on the MANQ. The latent mediator variable, service performance, was indexed with three indicator variables: adjusted adequacy of help received score, ACSS total score and RSA-R-PIR total score. The latent variable, outcome, was indexed with two indicator variables: SLDS and RAS total scores. The model used to estimate potential mediation effect posits a direct relationship between needs and outcome, and an indirect relationship between these two variables through their linkages with service performance (Fig. 1). For the mediation analysis, direct effect refers to the standardised path coefficient between needs and outcome, and indirect effect to the product of the standardised path coefficient between needs and service performance with the standardised path coefficient

between service performance and outcome. The total effect of needs on outcome is the sum of direct and indirect effects. The proportion of the effect of needs on outcome that is mediated by service performance is calculated as the indirect effect divided by the total effect. Standard errors for factor loadings and standardised path coefficients for the SEM analysis, as well as direct, indirect, total and proportional mediated effects for the mediation analysis, were estimated using non-parametric, model-based bootstrapping with 2000 iterations. Mediation occurred if the indirect effect was significant. The mediation was considered partial if the direct effect was also significant.

The model fit, which represents how an SEM fits with the sample data, was assessed using three indices: the chi-squared goodness-of-fit statistic (x2) where significance was tested using the Bollen-Stine bootstrap method, the Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) and the root-mean-squared error of approximation (RMSEA).

#### Results

# Participants

A total of 339 patients were recruited in the study, for an overall response rate of 81.2%. The size of patient subsamples recruited in the four mental health service networks ranged from 58 to 121. Missing data were estimated using multivariate imputations by chained equation (with 50 multiple imputations) in the mice package of R.33 Table 1 presents sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of participants, and Table 2 provides data on needs, service performance and outcomes. The mean patient age was 48.5 years, and 49% of respondents were men. Most participants were single, lived autonomously in an apartment and had not completed post-secondary education.

Mood and psychotic disorders were most prevalent and equally represented in the sample and 43.3% of patients had at least two diagnoses. The mean score for severity of needs on single items was 1.9, which corresponds to moderate need. QoL

## SEM and mediation analysis

Zero-order correlations between the indicator variables are presented in online supplement Table DS1. The model provided a good fit for the data, as suggested by the following statistics: non-significant goodness-of-fit based on the Bollen-Stine bootstrap distribution ((7) = 14.3, P= 0.107), TLI above 0.95 (TLI = 0.967) and RMSEA not statistically greater than 0.05 (RMSEA=0.056, onesided P=0.358). The model explained 67% of the variance in patient outcomes. All indicator variables were reliable and valid measures of their respective latent variables, as supported by significant moderate to high factor loadings (standardised ß=0.36-0.80, P<0.001, see online Table DS2 and Fig. 1).

In summary, the analysis revealed the following relationships between the latent variables (Fig. 1): (a) a significant negative association between needs and outcomes; (b) a significant positive association between service performance and outcomes; (c) a significant negative association between needs and service performance.

Direct, indirect and total effects were all significant (see Table 3 and Fig. 1), suggesting a partial mediation role for service performance between needs and outcome. We found that 16.4% of the total effect of needs on outcome was mediated by service performance (standard error: 0.05, z=3.6, P<0.001 with the Bollen-Stine bootstrap method after 2000 iterations).

# Discussion

This study explored whether service performance mediates between patient needs and outcomes among individuals with mental disorders in the context of a major mental health reform in Quebec, as one case example of many healthcare reforms conducted internationally.

Mean scores on severity of needs, ACSS, adjusted adequacy of help received and QoL for participants in this study were similar to the findings in other studies that focused solely on severe mental disorders.17,20 RAS scores were not different from the average scores produced by a meta-analysis involving individuals with various mental health disorders.30 The average score for single items on the RSA-R-PIR was 3.7, which was slightly lower than the score of 4.06 reported by O'Connell et al for a mixed sample of individuals followed in mental health and addiction services.28 The consistency between our results and those in this previous study suggests that our findings may be generalisable to patients with mental disorders located in similar settings, using the same instruments.

## Interpretation of the main findings

Overall, our results confirm the three hypotheses related to the ToC pathway, in which needs, service performance and outcomes are considered to be significantly associated. The study represents the first step toward validating a ToC pathway suggesting that improved service performance is an important requisite to achieving improved recovery outcomes in individuals with mental health disorders. Service performance was perceived as lower for users with high v. low needs, which may be explained by the fact that some needs were likely 'unmeetable', for example because of a lack of effective treatment for refractory symptoms, or in cases where patients reject treatments. Mental health services also fall short in meeting needs in domains other than health-related needs24 because of a lack of coordination between the mental healthcare system and inter-sectoral resources such as social services, housing, education and employment.34 Social networks among individuals with the highest needs tend to be very limited; relationship needs are quite difficult for mental health services to address, as well. Services that are insufficiently recovery-driven might lead to increased needs for information concerning illness and treatment, as well as limited patient involvement in treatment decisions. However, needs accounted for only a small proportion of the variance in service performance, suggesting that service performance may also be influenced by factors unrelated to patient-level conditions, for instance living conditions (numbers of residents in residential facilities, physical environment, and restrictiveness), accessibility of services, staff training and clinical governance.35 The link between continuity of care and better outcomes in the findings might be explained by an improved therapeutic alliance and increased patient involvement in treatment with close and continuous follow-up.36 An enhanced culture of recovery in services is usually associated with better employment rates and more stable housing,37 thus leading to an
improvement in perceived patient recovery,38 and QoL, in patients with psychiatric disorders.35

Service performance was a partial mediator between needs and outcomes: services were less efficient (i.e. less continuous, less adequate, less recovery-oriented) for patients with the highest needs, and this negatively affected outcomes (worse recovery and worse QoL), beyond the direct effect of severity of needs. The variables included in the model accounted for a substantial proportion of the variance in outcomes, which suggests good validity for the ToC pathway under study. However, further dimensions should be taken into account in developing an overarching model of change induced by mental health reform, for example, implementation of the reform.

## Limitations

The study involved certain limitations. First, causal relationships between needs, service performance and outcomes cannot be established with certainty. In the model, it was hypothesised that the direction of causality started from service performance to outcomes. However, one might argue that the direction of this relationship could be reversed: patients with better outcomes might see services as more efficient because of a tendency to perceive the environment in a more optimistic way. A longitudinal study with several measurement periods would be required to disentangle between the two directions of causality, using, for example, the methodology of crossed-lagged effects. Second, individuals recently admitted to hospital prior to the study or subject to a legal order were excluded from the study, which may have introduced a sampling bias to the detriment of patients with the highest needs. Third, data about potential participants who presented with criteria for exclusion were not systematically collected. It was thus not possible to evaluate the proportion of the sampling pool excluded on the basis of these criteria. Finally, our measure of adequacy of help received did not distinguish between unmet needs and needs that were unmeetable. However, unmeetable needs represent only a small minority of the needs observed in mental health.40

#### Implications

The findings of this study have important implications for clinical care, policy-making and service development. To our knowledge, this research is the first to introduce a comprehensive ToC model in order to assess relationships between severity of needs, service performance and outcomes. These findings underline the critical importance of mental healthcare reforms aimed at improving services' performance by promoting close follow-up of individuals with high mental-health-related needs. Community-based mental health agencies usually lack financial resources and have struggled to adequately serve individuals with the highest needs in mental health following system-level reform. In addition, the continuity between mental health and other services is usually insufficient to address acutely severe needs in the context of a recoveryoriented service system.41

To conclude, the fact that service performance mediated the relationship between patient needs and outcomes, and that services were less effective for people with greater needs, provide justification for more investment in specialist services for people with complex needs in mental health. Programmes promoting recovery-oriented services such as supported employment, assertive community treatment and intensive case management that target patients with the most severe needs may help improve recovery, as well as QoL, for this vulnerable population.

Keywords: Emotional Intelligence Schizophrenia MSCEIT Non-social cognition Mediation analysis

Background: Previous studies using the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCET) revealed significant performance deficits across all areas of Emotional Intelligence (EI) in schizophrenia patients compared to healthy controls. However, none of these studies has investigated a potential influence of non-social cognition on these findings.

Methods: 56 schizophrenia outpatients and 84 control subjects were investigated using the MSCEIT and the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS). Analyses of covariance were performed with adjustment for the BACS composite score and education. To investigate this issue in more detail, a mediation analysis was conducted.

Results: Patients showed significantly lower El and non-social cognition levels compared to healthy controls. After adjustment for BACS composite score and education, only the group difference in the ""managing emotions"" branch and thus in the ""strategic"" El part of the MSCETT remained statistically significant, whereas for all other MSCEIT branches (perceiving, using, understanding emotions) statistical significance was lost. The mediation analysis revealed that the difference between schizophrenia patients and controls regarding the MSCETT total score was almost fully attributable to the mediating effect of non-social cognition.

Conclusions: Our findings suggest that in schizophrenia patients El is largely influenced by non-social cognitive functioning. Only the ""managing emotions"" branch was found to be independent of non-social cognition. Consequently, non-social cognitive performance was mainly responsible for the observed differences in El between schizophrenia patients and controls. This has to be taken into account when interpreting MSCEIT data in this population.

#### 1. Introduction

Social and non-social cognitive deficits are core features of schizophrenia and exert a major influence on a patient's psychosocial functioning and well-being (Addington et al., 2006; Schaefer et al., 2013). Non-social cognition includes mental abilities like attention or memory, whereas the term 'social cognition' comprises cognitive processes underlying the processing of social stimuli and includes the following areas; theory of mind, attributional bias, social perception, and emotion processing, i.e. perceiving and using emotions (Barrett and Salovey, 2002; Green et al., 2008).

While the bulk of research has focused on emotion perception, the present study concentrates on the concept of ""Emotional Intelligence"" (EI) as introduced by Salovey and Mayer, who define EI as ""the subset of social intelligence that involves the ability to monitor ones' own and others feelings and emotions, to discriminate among them, and to

use this information to guide one's thinking and actions"" (Salovey and Mayer, 1990). From the perspective of this ""ability model"", EI is understood as a combination of emotion-specific abilities: perceiving, using, understanding, and managing emotions.

The Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT) is an established instrument to measure El-performance (Mayer et al., 2003) and has been used in schizophrenia studies before (Dawson et al., 2012; Eack et al., 2010; Fanning et al., 2012; Green et al., 2011a; Horan et al., 2011; Kee et al., 2009). Overall, previous studies have revealed significant performance deficits in all MSCEIT branches in schizophrenia patients compared to healthy controls. Importantly, these deficits have been shown to persist across phases of illness (Green et al., 2011b) and to be stable over time (Horan et al., 2011).

While it has been demonstrated that social and non-social cognition are related but distinct constructs (Ventura et al., 2013), the associations between ability-based EI and non-social cognition in schizophrenia have not yet been sufficiently investigated. Fanning et al. reported on a small to moderate association between the neurocognitive composite score of the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) (Green and Nuechterlein, 2004) and different social cognitive measures including the ""managing emotions"" branch of the MSCEIT (Fanning et al., 2012). In contrast, Dawson et al. found a positive correlation between the understanding emotions branch of the MSCEIT and the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) (Keefe et al., 2004) composite score (Dawson et al., 2012), whereas in Eack et al.'s study all MSCEIT branches correlated with non-social cognition in moderate effect sizes (Eack et al., 2010). Interestingly, none of these studies investigated whether the observed difference in El between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls may be fully or partly attributable to group differences in non-social cognition (in other words, whether non-social cognition may act as a mediator between diagnostic group and EI). Accordingly, the present study was conducted to bridge this gap.

#### 2. Methods

All procedures contributing to this work complied with the standards of the local Ethics Committee and were conducted according to GCP standards on human experimentation and the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2008. All participants signed informed consent forms. Study procedures were performed by a trained research team.

#### 2.1. Participants

The study sample consisted of patients suffering from paranoid schizophrenia from a specialized outpatient unit of the Department for Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics of the Medical University Innsbruck and of healthy control subjects from the community. A brief medical screening interview was used to exclude subjects with any physical or neurological illness or any condition affecting neural or cerebrovascular function. In patients, diagnosis was confirmed by means of the Mini Mental Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) (Sheehan et al., 1998). They had to be clinically stable without hospitalization for at least 6 months and had to be on stable medication for at least three months. Psychopathology was assessed by means of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) (Kay et al., 1987). Exclusion criteria included any other axis I disorder as well as axis II disorders as assessed by the Structured Clinical Interview for Axis-II-Disorders according to DSM-IV (SCID II) (Wittchen et al., 1996).

Comparison subjects had to be unremarkable in the M.I.N.I. and the SCID II. They were excluded, if they had a family history of schizophrenia, other psychotic disorders, or bipolar disorder among first-degree relatives.

#### 2.2. Emotional Intelligence

To assess EI, the German pencil-and-paper version (Steinmayr et al., 2011) of the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso-Emotional-Intelligence Test (MSCEIT) (Mayer et al., 2002a, 2002b) was used. This instrument consists of 141 items and provides eight task scores that measure the four branches of El: perceiving, using, understanding, and managing emotions. Whereas the ""perceiving emotions"" part measures the ability to

Socio-demographic and clinical variables.

recognize emotions accurately in faces and pictures, the ""using emotions"" part is about using emotions to enhance cognitive processes. The ""understanding emotions"" part tests the knowledge how emotions interact with each other and change over time and the ""managing emotions"" part measures the ability to deal with and regulate emotions. The test contains different kinds of tasks: for example, subjects have to indicate to which degree specific emotions are expressed in a photograph of a human face, or they are asked to evaluate the usefulness of certain emotions in specific situations. The MSCEIT also contains vignettes with descriptions of different emotional states in combination with ""solutions"" to cope with these emotions. In succession, subjects have to indicate how effective each solution is ( effectiveness ranges from ""1"" very ineffective, to ""5"" very effective). These branches cover all aspects of EI and can be assigned to the areas of emotional experiencing (=""experiential El""; perceiving + using emotions) and emotional reasoning (= ""strategic El""; understanding + managing emotions). Similar to other intelligence tests, the average score is 100 with a standard deviation of 15.

The test is both content and structurally valid (overall reliability r = 0.93) besides showing discriminate validity from measures of analytic intelligence and many personality constructs (Brackett and Salovey, 2006).

#### 2.3. Non-social cognition

Non-social cognition was measured with the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) (Keefe et al., 2004). This battery covers a broad range of neurocognitive functions (verbal memory, working memory, motor speed, attention, executive functioning, and verbal fluency) and requires less than 35 min to complete. The composite score can be calculated by standardizing the average of those 6 measures by dividing that average by the standard deviation of the average in the normative sample.

#### 2.4. Statistical methods

Statistical analysis was performed by means of the statistical package SPSS, version 22.

The Shapiro-Wilk test was employed to investigate metric variables, in particular subscales of the MSCEIT and the BACS, for deviations from normality. Group comparisons (schizophrenia versus control) with respect to socio-demographic and clinical variables were performed by means of the t-test, Mann-Whitney U-test and Fisher's exact test, depending on the variable type (normally distributed, non-normally distributed metric, and dichotomous variables, respectively). The Mann-Whitney U-test was also employed for group comparisons with regard to El and non-social cognition, as the majority of the subscales of the MSCEIT and the BACS showed significant deviation from a normal distribution. In order to assess if differences in El between schizophrenia patients and controls are fully or partly accounted for by differences in

non-social cognition, analyses of covariance were performed with adjustment for the BACS composite score. To investigate this issue in more detail, a mediation analysis was conducted with group as the independent variable, EI as the dependent variable, and non-social cognition (BACS composite score) as a potential mediator between the two variables, using the approach proposed by Preacher and Hayes, 2008. Following Preacher and Hayes, unstandardized regression coefficients were used as path coefficients. In the case of a dichotomous indepen dent variable these coefficients allow a simple interpretation as mean group differences and are therefore more meaningful than standardized regression coefficients or correlation coefficients.

#### 3. Results

#### 3.1. Sample characteristics

56 schizophrenia patients and 84 healthy control subjects without any axis I or axis II disorder according to DSM-IV were included into the study. Demographic and clinical characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The two groups were comparable with respect to age and sex but differed with regard to education.

#### 3.2. Emotional Intelligence and non-social cognition

MSCEIT scores were available for 56 schizophrenia patients and 84 control subjects. Compared to general population norms, patients scored below average in the ""understanding"" and ""managing emotions"" branches and thus in the ""strategic"" EI part of the MSCEIT. They performed significantly worse than controls in all MSCEIT branches except for ""perceiving emotions"", where no significant group difference was found (Table 2).

BACS scores were available for 44 schizophrenia patients and 84 controls. Twelve patients were not able to complete the BACS. All BACS subscores were significantly lower in the patient group compared to healthy controls (Table 2).

Adjustment for educational level left significant differences in MSCEIT and BACS scores almost unchanged. The only exception was the ""experiential El"" branch of the MSCEIT, in which only a trend level significance (p = 0.053) could be detected after adjustment, while all other ""adjusted"" p-values stayed below 0.002.

#### 3.3. Effects of non-social cognition on Emotional Intelligence

After adjustment for the BACS composite score and education, only the group difference in the ""managing emotions"" branch of the MSCEIT remained statistically significant, whereas statistical significance was lost for all other MSCEIT branches (Table 3). Consequently, only ""strategic El"", composed of the branches ""understanding"" and ""managing emotions"", differed between schizophrenia patients and control subjects. There was no significant interaction between group and BACS composite score for any of the MSCEIT branches and also not for the MSCEIT total score.

#### 3.4. Mediation analyses

Mediation analysis revealed that the difference between schizophrenia patients and controls regarding the MSCETT total score was almost fully attributable to the mediating effect of non-social cognition, as quantified by the BACS composite score (Fig. 1). Due to the mediation by non-social cognition the mean difference in the MSCEIT total score between schizophrenia patients and controls was reduced from 18.3 points (total effect, c) to 7.0 points (direct effect, c' ).

For Strategic EI, the difference between schizophrenia patients and controls was only partially mediated by non-social cognition. The group effect (schizophrenia vs. controls) was reduced in size (from 27.6 to 13.3 points) but remained significant, as illustrated in Fig. 2.

Results of the mediation analysis for the MSCEIT branch ""managing emotions"" are shown in Fig. 3. For this variable, the group difference was only slightly reduced by the mediator BACS composite score (from c = 20.4 to c' = 15.4) and the mediation effect of non-social cognition did not attain statistical significance.

#### 3.5. Additional correlation analyses

For completeness, correlations between EI and non-social cognition (BACS composite score) were investigated separately in schizophrenia patients and controls (Table 4). In schizophrenia patients, the BACS composite score correlated highly with the MSCEIT branch ""understanding emotions"" and to a lesser extent with ""using emotions"", while the correlations with the two other branches did not reach significance. The MSCEIT total score and the area score ""strategic El"" also showed significant correlations with the BACS. In healthy controls, correlations between BACS and MSCEIT were generally lower than in patients (details in Table 4). Only the correlation of the BACS with the

#### 4. Discussion

With the present study we aimed to shed a light on the influence of non-social cognition on El in schizophrenia patients. To this end, we assessed EI and non-social cognition in schizophrenia patients and control subjects using the MSCEIT as well as the BACS and performed correlation and mediation analyses.

As expected, schizophrenia patients achieved significantly lower BACS (sub)scores than healthy control subjects. Similarly, patients showed significantly lower MSCEIT total scores and also performed significantly worse compared to controls in three out of four MSCEIT branches. These findings are largely in line with previous studies, where patients had shown an impaired performance in all MSCEIT

branches (Dawson et al., 2012; Green et al., 2011b; Kee et al., 2009). However, those studies are not entirely comparable with ours. We investigated El in a large sample of chronically ill but stable schizophrenia outpatients with a mild degree of symptomatology, whereas earlier studies had either a smaller sample size (Dawson et al., 2012) or mixed patient samples (schizophrenia, schizoaffective and schizophreniform disorder) (Green et al., 2011b; Kee et al., 2009).

Notably, adjustment for BACS composite score and education substantially diminished the difference in El performance between patients and controls leaving only the difference in the ""managing emotions"" branch and in the ""strategic El"" part of the MSCEIT significant. Accordingly, only the ""managing emotions"" branch was found to be independent of non-social cognition. Interestingly, the MSCEIT ""managing emotions"" subscale is also part of the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB). It was chosen to cover social cognition because of ""its relatively stronger relationship to functional status"" (Nuechterlein et al., 2008). In the light of our findings the decision to integrate this subscale of the MSCEIT in the MCCB appears to be even more prudent.

When performing a mediation analysis, the difference in the MSCEIT total score detected between schizophrenia patients and controls was almost fully attributable to the mediating effect of non-social cognition. In other words, non-social cognition was largely responsible for the poorer performance of schizophrenia patients in the MSCEIT. This should be taken into account in future studies using the MSCEIT in schizophrenia and possibly also other patient groups.

The current study also has some limitations. Firstly, we used only a single test to investigate El. In addition, the MSCEIT has been criticized for measuring social knowledge rather than performance based El (Brody, 2004). Although the interaction of social and non-social cognition is generally well established (Sergi et al., 2007), further studies using other El measures are needed to investigate the relationship between El and non-social cognition. In addition, future studies should assess the motivation of patients and controls to complete the MSCEIT vs. the BACS. Secondly, due to the broad array of applied treatments we were not able to account for a potential influence of medication. However, given the fact that secondary analyses of CATIE found no differences between antipsychotics with respect to social cognition such a confounding influence seems unlikely (Penn et al., 2009). In addition, adverse events such as sedation may have impacted upon the reported results. At the time of study inclusion all patients were on a stable medication regimen for at least three month, but not all were symptomatically remitted. Indeed, mean PANSS scores (53.9 ± 13.0) indicated only mild symptom severity levels. Lastly, although none of the patients had received psychotherapy specifically targeting social cognition we cannot rule out a possible influence of more generic psychotherapeutic or psychosocial interventions in patients. In summary, the present study clearly points out that in schizophrenia patients ability-based El is largely influenced by non-social cognitive functioning. This has to be considered, when interpreting MSCEIT data in this population.

### A B S T R A C T

Background: Family carers of people with dementia frequently become depressed or anxious. In observational studies, more emotion-focused and less dysfunctional coping predict fewer psychological symptoms, but no randomised controlled trial (RCT) has directly investigated emotion-focused coping as mediator of effectiveness of a successful psychological intervention. We hypothesised that emotionfocused coping would mediate the START psychological intervention's effects in an RCT. We tested whether mediated effects were moderated by severity of baseline symptoms.

Methods: 260 family carers from NHS dementia services were randomised to START (manualised coping skills intervention), or treatment-as-usual (TAU). Blinded raters administered the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-T) and Brief COPE inventory at baseline, 4 and 8 months. HADS-T improved in the intervention group when compared to TAU at all levels of psychological distress. We tested whether coping was a mediator and for moderated mediation, and (post-hoc) subgroup treatment effects on coping.

Results: Data were available for 187 carers (71.9%) for the mediation analysis. The reduced HADS-T score in the intervention group was mediated by increased emotion-focused coping only among carers with higher (16+) baseline HADS-T scores (mediated effect= = 0.63 [- 1.11, -0.15]; proportion of overall effect=33% [3%, 64%]).

Limitations: We did not measure plausible psychosocial treatment mechanisms other than coping. Conclusions: START benefited family carers both in preventing and treating psychological morbidity, through different mechanisms of action. The most psychologically distressed their emotion-focused coping and did not decrease their dysfunctional coping, while others benefited but not through this mechanism.

### 1. Introduction

Family carers of people with dementia typically have high levels of depression and anxiety compared to the general population, with 40% reporting clinically significant symptoms (Cooper et al., 2007; Crespo et al., 2005; Cuijpers, 2005; Pinquart et al., 2003b). This morbidity tends to persist without targeted intervention (Cooper et al., 2010a), and predicts care breakdown, and therefore care home placement; and care recipient abuse (Cooper et al., 2010b; Cooper et al., 2010a). Whilst NICE guidance highlights the clinical need for tailored interventions to support carer mental health, no specific interventions are recommended (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence et al., 2011).

Coping is the process by which carers try to manage stress (Lazarus et al., 1984), and may be an important and theoretically modifiable determinant of psychological morbidity (Cooper et al., 2008b; Li et al., 2012). Coping behaviours can be broadly divided into three categories: problem-focused (practical steps to remove or reduce the stressor), emotion-focused (managing one's emotional responses to stress), and dysfunctional (disengaging from the stressful situation or emotions) (Coolidge et al., 2000; Li et al., 2012). Observational studies of family carers of people with dementia, who have to cope with a problem which cannot be entirely solved, an inevitably deteriorating illness in their relative, show associations between carers who use less emotion-focused or more dysfunctional coping and increased depressive and

anxiety symptoms (Li et al., 2012). Therefore coping is a theoretical target for intervention, but randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have reported conflicting findings (Li et al., 2013). Group-based cognitive-behavioural interventions that reduced psychological morbidity appeared to increase use of both helpful and dysfunctional coping versus control (Li et al., 2013). No RCT has directly investigated emotion-focused coping as the mediating mechanism of effective treatment (Li et al., 2013).

We recently demonstrated that STrAtegies for RelaTives (START), a manualised individual coping-based intervention for family carers, was clinically and cost-effective in reducing psychological morbidity, with the intervention group reporting significantly lower HADS-T (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) scores at 8-month follow-up versus usual treatment (Knapp et al., 2013; Livingston et al., 2013). Understanding how the intervention works could inform its clinical use. We hypothesised that treatment effects were mediated by increased emotion-focused coping. The intervention was offered to all recently referred carers irrespective of their level of psychological morbidity and tailored to their individual needs, and we hypothesised that mechanisms of action may differ between those with lower levels of psychological distress, in whom the goal was prevention of clinically significant psychological morbidity, and those in whom treatment of existing psychological distress was the primary goal. Therefore, we also tested whether treatment effects on coping systematically differed between carers with high and low baseline psychological morbidity, and whether this affected final clinical outcomes.

### 1.1. Objectives

To test the hypothesis that increased emotion-focused coping at 4 months would mediate the effects of the START intervention in reducing psychological morbidity symptoms at 8 months, and to test whether this mechanism was moderated by baseline morbidity.

### 1.2. Method

Details of START trial methods have been reported elsewhere (Knapp et al., 2013; Livingston et al., 2013)

### 1.3. Setting and participants

The START trial is a multi-centred, pragmatic RCT of a coping skills intervention versus treatment-as-usual (TAU) for family carers of people with dementia. The study received ethics committee approval; and Research & Development permission from local National Health Service (NHS) trusts, and we have reported the primary outcome results elsewhere (Knapp et al., 2013; Livingston et al., 2013). The current study uses baseline, 4- and 8-month follow-up data. Carers were recruited between November 2009 and June 2011.

We recruited self-identified primary family carers, who provided at least weekly support for a person diagnosed with dementia and referred in the past year to one of four study sites (three mental health dementia services in London and Essex, and a specialist neurology centre). We excluded carers who: could not give informed consent (for example, having dementia themselves); were participating in another research trial as family carers (unless solely as informants for the patient); or lived more than 1.5 h journey from the researchers' base.

#### 1.4. Therapists

All therapists held undergraduate degrees in psychology, had no professional clinical qualifications, were trained by our team in the intervention in a formal, standardised training programme and received ongoing clinical supervision from a clinical psychologist in order to deliver the START intervention and administer assessments.

### 1.5. Interventions

### 1.5.1. Intervention-START manual

1.5.1.1. Setting. Carers randomised to the intervention were offered the eight-session START intervention, to be delivered to individual carers, in addition to usual care. Each session took place at a location convenient to the carer, usually his or her home, without the patient in the room and lasted approximately one hour. Therapy was carried out with an interpreter if the carer did not speak English fluently.

1.5.1.2. Content. The therapy programme was adapted from the Coping with Caring manual (Gallagher-Thompson et al., 2002) for UK use with individual family carers. The intervention was based on the stress appraisal and coping model (Lazarus et al., 1984). The standardised manual was designed to allow flexibility and individually tailored to address carer's particular issues and difficulties. Sessions covered:

1: Overview of dementia and its symptoms; carer stress; and introducing relaxation exercises.

2-5: Behavioural management; changing unhelpful thoughts; assertive communication; promoting emotion-focused coping strategies such as seeking emotional support and positive reframing.

6: Future care needs, with UK-specific information about care and legal planning, and information leaflets about making common decisions (Livingston et al., 2010).

7: Planning pleasant activities (behavioural activation).

8: Maintaining the skills learned over time.

Carers were asked to complete homework between sessions. All sessions included a relaxation exercise, also given to carers on an audio CD.

We defined adherence to therapy as participating in five or more sessions, as the first five sessions covered the core components of coping and behavioural change. Carers in the intervention arm completed a mean of 6.4 sessions (SD=2.71), with most carers demonstrating adherence to therapy (130/173, 75.1%).

### 1.6. Treatment-as-usual (TAU)

Standard NHS service, consisting of assessment, diagnosis and information, drug treatment, cognitive stimulation therapy, practical support, treatment of neuropsychiatric and cognitive symptoms, and carer support, in line with NICE guidance (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence et al., 2011).

#### 1.7. Outcome assessments

All carers were interviewed at baseline, four and eight months after randomisation, usually in their own home unless they preferred to come to the research team base. Patients were not interviewed. We have continued following up carers for 2 years.

At baseline, we asked carers for sociodemographic information about themselves and the patient, including: age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, level of education, relationship to the patient (for example spouse, child), and whether they were living together.

Carers completed assessments at all timepoints, including:

Primary outcome: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) (Zigmond et al., 1983). A 14-item self-report questionnaire about psychological symptoms. The total score (HADS-T) was the primary outcome for the trial as it demonstrates superior predictive value for ICD depressive disorders than either the Anxiety or Depression subscale alone (Bjelland et al., 2002). We categorised carers as non-cases (HADS 0–7), possible cases (8–15), and cases (16-42), based on the range of cut-offs for clinical caseness for anxiety or depression in previous studies (Bjelland et al., 2002).

Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced inventory (Brief COPE) (Carver, 1997). A 28-item self-report questionnaire, asking how often in the past month (from 1, not at all, to 4, a lot) carers used each strategy to cope with problems. Items were divided into three subscales: problem-focused, emotion-focused, and dysfunctional coping (Carver et al., 1989; Coolidge et al., 2000; Cooper et al., 2008a). The Brief COPE has been used in several studies of family carers of people with dementia (Li et al., 2012), demonstrating satisfactory psychometric properties (Cooper et al., 2008a).

Zarit Burden Interview (Zarit et al., 1980). A widely used 22-item self-report questionnaire measuring subjective caring burden in the past month, with established psychometric properties among carers of people with dementia (Hebert et al., 2000; Schulze et al., 2005). High scores are associated with poor physical and mental wellbeing (Pinquart et al., 2003a).

Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). A structured questionnaire for evaluating neuropsychiatric symptoms in 12 domains common in people with dementia, rated by frequency and severity in the last month (Cummings et al., 1994; Cummings, 1997). The NPI has established psychometric properties (Cummings et al., 1994; Cummings, 1997).

### 1.8. Recruitment and randomisation

Potentially eligible carers were approached by their clinicians, and given an information sheet. We screened 472 carers, of whom 260 were eligible, gave consent and were randomised (Fig. 2). The most common reason for exclusion was declined consent (181/212). Consenting carers were more likely to be the patient's spouse (109/ 260, 42%) compared with those eligible but not randomised (65/ 190, 34%). Otherwise consenting and non-consenting carers were generally comparable on known demographic variables (carer and patient gender, relationship with patient;(Livingston et al., 2013). Clinically significant psychological morbidity was common among carers, with 40% (105/259) meeting criteria for overall psychological morbidity caseness (HADS-T 16+). Most patients had mild to moderate dementia (212/259, 81.8%, as indicated by a global score of 1 or 2 on the Clinical Dementia Rating).

Consenting carers were randomised to the intervention or treatment-as-usual (TAU) on a 2:1 ratio (intervention: TAU) to allow for therapist clustering in the intervention arm, and stratified by treatment site with random permuted blocks, using a computerised randomisation system s set up by an independent Clinical Trials Unit Randomisation codes were accessed by the Trial Manager and supervising psychologist but not by the remainder of the team.

Intervention and TAU groups were generally balanced for patient and baseline carer demographic and clinical characteristics. (Livingston et al., 2013).

### 1.9. Blinding

Raters were blinded, but it was not possible to blind carers. The researchers worked in two teams, each assessing outcomes for roughly half the carers and providing therapy to those in the remaining half. Raters asked carers at the beginning of each assessment not to disclose their randomisation status,

### 1.10. Statistical analysis

Using a series of regression analyses, we tested whether coping strategies mediated the effects of treatment on psychological morbidity (HADS-T), and whether these were moderated by baseline morbidity. Bonferroni corrections were not applicable as our tests were not statistically independent, and such corrections would likely be too conservative. (Gelman et al. 2012; Perneger, 1998.

### 1.10.1. Mechanisms of missing data

We used logistic regression to identify variables significantly associated with missingness on the Brief COPE at 4 months or HADS-T at 8 months (Carpenter et al., 2008). After excluding predictors with p>0.10, we repeated the regression until all remaining predictors were independently significantly associated with missingness (p < 0.05), and used these to generate inverse probability weights, which were then included in all of the following analyses in order to adjust for the missing data (Seaman et al., 2011).

### 1.11. Mediation

To test the hypothesis that emotion-focused coping mediated effects of treatment in reducing psychological morbidity, we conducted MacKinnon and colleagues' joint significance test (Mackinnon et al., 2002), a variation of the Baron and Kenny method (Baron et al., 1986). This involved regression equations to test 1) whether randomisation predicted coping (4 months), and 2) whether emotion-focused coping (4 months) predicted HADS-T score (8 months) after controlling for randomisation. Mediation was established if the two predictors above were jointly significant (Mackinnon et al., 2002), and we examined the effect size as a measure of clinical significance (Cohen, 1988). In both equations, we included as covariates study site and baseline HADS-T score, and variables which had previously been associated with psychological morbidity: baseline coping, demographics (carer age and gender), and stressors (Zarit Burden Inventory, and VNPI (Cooper et al., 2007; Pinquart et al., 2006). We did this for emotion-focused coping at 4 months, and then in turn for dysfunctional and problem-focused coping.

### 1.12. Moderated mediation

To test whether any mediated treatment effects via coping might systematically vary with baseline psychological morbidity, we followed the Muller and colleagues procedure (Muller et al., 2005), adapted from the Baron and Kenny (Baron et al., 1986) but including the putative moderator (baseline HADS-T score) as an interaction term in each of three regressions (Fig. 1). We did this for emotion-focused coping at 4 months and then in turn for dysfunctional and problem-focused coping.

Moderated mediation required that baseline HADS-T score did not moderate the overall treatment effect on final HADS-T score (Regression 1), but that it moderated a significant treatment effect on coping (Regression 2); and that coping predicted final HADS-T score (Regression 3; Fig. 1) (Muller et al., 2005). For each Brief COPE subscale, we estimated mediated effects of treatment via coping for the mean baseline HADS scores within non-cases, possible cases and cases (Muller et al., 2005); and the size of each mediated effect as a proportion of the overall treatment effect as a measure of clinical significance.

To investigate how clinically different levels of morbidity affected treatment effects on coping where the latter were significant moderated by HADS-T score, we conducted post-hoc subgroup efficacy analyses using mixed model regression. This included randomisation with an interaction term for HADS caseness (non-case, possible case, case), and all previously specified baseline covariates, We inspected the confidence intervals of estimated subgroup effects to infer a

Overall treatment effect

plausible range of treatment differences between subgroups (Lagakos, 2006). As the cut-offs for caseness could influence subgroup effects, we performed sensitivity analyses using alternative cut-offs (0-11, 12–19, and 20– ), based on two studies reporting an optimal cut-off of 20+ for major depressive disorder (Bjelland et al., 2002).

### 2. Results

187/260 (71.9%) of carers completed both the Brief COPE at 4 months and HADS at 8 months, and were included in the mediation analysis (Fig. 2). Table 1 shows the key characteristics of the carers categorised by HADS-T caseness subgroups, and their use of coping strategies at baseline and follow-up.

### 2.1. Mediation

We found no association between randomisation to the intervention and change in any coping strategy over 4 months including emotion-focused coping (mean difference in coping [intervention -TAU|=0.68, 95% Cl: - 0.71, 2.06), after adjusting for baseline covariates. Therefore our hypothesis that emotion-focused coping mediated treatment effects on psychological morbidity was not supported. As expected however, increased emotion-focused coping at 4 months predicted reduced psychological morbidity at 8 months in the whole sample: each point increase in emotion-focused coping predicted a change in HADS-T score of -0.35 (95% Cl: -0.51, -0.18). This model accounted for over half of the variance in psychological morbidity at 8 months (R2=0.58).

### 2.2. Moderated mediation

This analysis tested whether any mediated effect of intervention via coping might be moderated by baseline psychological morbidity, and to what extent any mediated effects accounted for the overall effects of treatment. The overall effect of treatment in reducing HADS-T score at 8 months (mean difference= - 1.26, 95% CI: - 2.12, - 0.39) was not significantly moderated by baseline HADS-T score (Randomisation × HADS-T interaction= −0.09, 95% Cl: -0.19, 0.02) after adjusting for covariates (Table 2).

### 2.2.1. Emotion-focused coping

The relationship between randomisation status and emotionfocused coping at 4 months was significantly moderated by baseline HADS-T (Randomisation x HADS-T interaction=0.15, 95% Cl: 0.07, 0.23), and increased coping at 4 months predicted decreased HADS-T at 8 months: each point increase in emotion-focused coping predicted a change in HADS-T score of -0.35 (95% Cl: -0.51, -0.20) (Table 2). Thus moderated mediation was established. This model accounted for over half of the variance in psychological morbidity at 8 months (R2 =0.59).

For cases (HADS score 16+), there was a mediated treatment effect (via increased emotion-focused coping) which led to a change in HADS-T at 8 months of -0.63 points (95% CI: - 1.11, -0.158), accounting for approximately one-third of the overall effect of treatment (mediated proportion=33%, 95% CI: 3%, 64%). There was no evidence to suggest a mediated effect for possible cases (scores 8–15) or for non-cases (scores 0–7) (Table 2).

The post-hoc subgroup efficacy analysis for coping gave similar findings: only cases reported increased emotion-focused coping at 4 months follow-up in the intervention group compared to TAU (mean difference=2.05, 95% Cl: 0.12, 3.98; Fig. 3). This was a small to medium effect size (Cohen's d=0.37). This effect was confirmed in the sensitivity analysis using higher HADS-T cut-offs (12/20) (mean difference=4.42, 95% Cl=1.33, 7.51; Cohen's d=0.76, medium to large effect size).

### 2.2.2. Problem-focused coping

Problem-focused coping at 4 months did not significantly predict HADS-T at 8 months (Randomisation × HADS-T interaction==0.13, 95% CI: -0.31, 0.04) (Table 2). Thus moderated mediation was not established.

### 2.2.3. Dysfunctional coping

The relationship between randomisation status and dysfunctional coping at 4 months was moderated by baseline HADS-T score (Randomisation × HADS-T interaction=0.17, 95% Cl: 0.10, 0.24), and increased dysfunctional coping at 4 months predicted increased HADS-T at 8 months: each point increase in dysfunctional coping predicted an increase in HADS-T score of 0.26 (95% CI: 0.08, 0.43) (Table 2). Thus moderated mediation was established. This model accounted for over half of the variance in psychological morbidity at 8 months (R2=0.57). However there was no evidence of clinically significant mediated effects within each subgroup (Table 2). Similarly the post-hoc analysis found no reliable differences in subgroup treatment effects on dysfunctional coping, but clearly dysfunctional coping did not decrease among cases versus TAU (Fig. 3).

### 3. Discussion

### 3.1. Key findings

This was the first RCT directly investigating emotion-focused coping as a mechanism of psychological intervention for carers of people with dementia. Although our primary hypothesis that change in emotion-focused coping strategies mediated the overall effects of treatment on carer psychological morbidity was not supported, we found that increased emotion-focused coping mediated intervention effects for carers with case levels of psychological morbidity (HADS-T 16+ ) when they entered the study, accounting for about one-third of the overall effect of intervention for this subgroup. In general, the intervention appeared to work in different ways for carers who were already depressed and anxious compared to those who were not.

The intervention had both preventative and therapeutic effects, as it was similarly effective in people with different levels of baseline psychological morbidity. Carers with the greatest distress (particularly cases with HADS-T 20+) improved following treatment as a result of using more emotion-focused coping strategies, even though their use of dysfunctional strategies remained high, consistent with previous RCTs (Li et al., 2013). The findings could not be attributed to the more distressed carers facing greater burden and generally attempting more coping, as the analyses were adjusted for these covariates.

#### 3.2. Comparison with other studies

Our previous observational studies also found that increase in emotion-focused coping predicted decreased subsequent morbidity in carers of people with dementia (Cooper et al., 2008b; Li et al., 2012). Subgroup treatment differences might explain why RCTs on the whole have failed to report consistent significant intervention effects on coping (Li et al., 2013), despite the robust relationships between coping and psychological morbidity in observational studies (Li et al., 2012). Our finding that different carers responded differently to the same multicomponent intervention potentially explains the counterintuitive RCT findings that group coping skills interventions appear efficacious in reducing depression while increasing both helpful and dysfunctional coping (Li et al., 2013).

It is unclear why baseline psychological morbidity moderated the treatment effects on dysfunctional coping; as baseline HADS-T score increased, intervention resulted in a relative increase in dysfunctional coping versus TAU. This did not stop carers at any level of distress benefiting from the intervention, even though dysfunctional coping was detrimental for 8 month outcomes in the current study as in observational studies (Cooper et al., 2008b; Li et al., 2012). Given that increasing dysfunctional coping strategies was not a stated goal of the intervention, a possible explanation would be that highly distressed carers engaged with therapy by generally coping more proactively, which might initially include using more of the (dysfunctional) strategies already familiar to them. Failures that result from proactive coping attempts might perpetuate self-blame, a dysfunctional coping strategy (Curry et al., 1987). Engaging with therapy could also mean becoming more aware of one's dysfunctional coping behaviour and reporting it more accurately, and this increased awareness is an important prerequisite for behaviour change (Miller et al., 1992). Coping is a dynamic process, and some strategies labelled ""dysfunctional"" (such as denial or disengagement) could have been adaptive in various ways in the short term (Au et al., 2010; Lazarus, 1983), for example by allowing cancer patients time to process the distressing situation (Rabinowitz et al., 2006; Vos et al., 2007).

### 3.3. Study strengths

This study was a pragmatic RCT with broad inclusion criteria, and recruited carers with varied geographical and sociodemographic backgrounds in NHS clinical practice, ensuring that the results are applicable to the general UK carer population. Therapist training and supervision ensured that the intervention (and assessments) were delivered consistently, reflected in the minimal therapist clustering (Livingston et al., 2013). For the mediation analyses, we used techniques to address missing data, and coping and psychological morbidity outcomes from different time points (4 and 8 months respectively) to draw stronger conclusions about causality and sensitivity analyses confirmed our initial results.

### 3.4. Limitations

There was no attentional control group; however given other RCTs of individual psychosocial interventions and carer befriending have been ineffective in changing psychological morbidity (Charlesworth et al., 2008; Waldorff et al., 2012), the current findings are unlikely to be explained by therapist attention alone. The study was powered for the primary outcome (HADS-T), not coping, and the Brief COPE might not have been sensitive to all elements of coping taught in the manual (for instance, the intended effect of increased pleasant activities could plausibly have been reported as ""distraction/disengagement"", considered a dysfunctional coping strategy); and we did not test all three coping subscales together in the same mediation model due to lack of power. Nonetheless it would have been unethical to continue randomising carers for the sake of investigating the mechanism of an effective intervention. Finally, we did not measure other plausible psychosocial variables (such as grief, recent life events, actual use of social support) that could have influenced psychological morbidity and coping.

#### 4. Conclusion

Complex psychological interventions work differently for different people. The current findings suggest that family carers may benefit in different ways from START, a manualised intervention that could be individually tailored. The most psychologically distressed changed their coping style, while those who were less distressed benefited from the intervention through other mechanisms. START effectively prevents and treats carer psychological morbidity, but mechanisms of action appear to differ between more and less distressed carers.

Background. Many medications administered to patients with schizophrenia possess anticholinergic properties. When aggregated, pharmacological treatments may result in a considerable anticholinergic burden. The extent to which anticholinergic burden has a deleterious effect on cognition and impairs ability to participate in and benefit from psychosocial treatments is unknown.

Method. Seventy patients were followed for approximately 3 years. The MATRICS consensus cognitive battery (MCCB) was administered at baseline. Anticholinergic burden was measured with the Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden (ACB) scale. Ability to benefit from psychosocial programmes was measured using the DUNDRUM-3 Programme Completion Scale (D-3) at baseline and follow-up. Psychiatric symptoms were measured using the PANSS. Total antipsychotic dose was measured using chlorpromazine equivalents. Functioning was measured using the Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS).

Results. Mediation analysis found that the influence of anticholinergic burden on ability to participate and benefit from psychosocial programmes was completely mediated by the MCCB. For every 1-unit increase on the ACB scale, change scores for DUNDRUM-3 decreased by -0.27 points. This relationship appears specific to anticholinergic burden and not total antipsychotic dose. Moreover, mediation appears to be specific to cognition and not psychopathology. Baseline functioning also acted as mediator but only when MCCB was not controlled for.

Conclusions. Anticholinergic burden has a significant impact on paticipate in and benefit from psychosocial treatment programmes. Physicians need to be mindful of the cumulative effect that medications can have on patient cognition, functional capacity and ability to benefit from psychosocial treatments.

### Introduction

The neurocognitive theory of schizophrenia has demonstrated explanatory reach (Deutsch, 2011; Kahn & Keefe 2013). Cognitive impairment accounts for a range of outcomes including ability to live independently, employment, quality of life and reactive violence in addition to response to antipsychotic medication (Kim et al. 2008; Chang et al. 2013; Kahn & Keefe, 2013; O'Reilly et al. 2015). Although pharmacotherapy is the primary treatment for the symptoms of schizophrenia (Leucht et al. 2012) such as delusions and hallucinations, it is less effective for negative symptoms

like lack of motivation, nor is it effective for cognitive impairment (Harvey & Bowie, 2012; Nielsen et al. 2015). Only one in seven patients achieve recovery when defined as clinical and social adaptation sustained over time (Jääskeläinen et al. 2013). Psychosocial treatments are generally used to address the functional disability that characterizes schizophrenia (Grant et al. 2011). Unfortunately cognitive problems may also interfere with the effectiveness of these interventions (Green et al. 2000; Kurtz, 2011; O'Reilly et al. 2016).

To facilitate the development of cognitive enhancing agents the US National Institute of Mental Health devised a neuropsychological battery for treatment studies, the MATRICS consensus cognitive battery (MCCB; Nuechterlein et al. 2008). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires that cognitive enhancing agents be supported by both evidence of

change in cognitive performance and improvements in 'real world' functioning (Buchanan et al. 2005). Currently pharmacological attempts to enhance cognition among patients with schizophrenia have been unsuccessful (Harvey & Bowie, 2012). The reason for this is unclear. Excessive synaptic pruning may limit the potential for improving cognition via neurotransmitters (Keshavan et al. 1994; Harvey & Bowie, 2012; Sekar et al. 2016). But the use and dose of concurrent medications may also be important (Harvey & Bowie, 2012). One mechanism through which a deleterious effect of concurrent medications might occur is via the cholinergic system (Nebes et al. 2005; Campbell et al. 2009). The cholinergic system is a series of pathways from the basal forebrain radiating throughout the cerebral cortex and involved in regulating attention and memory (Chudasama et al. 2004; Sarter et al. 2005).

Most antipsychotic medications administered to patients with schizophrenia possess anticholinergic properties (Chew et al. 2008). The side-effect profile of antipsychotic medication is also sometimes treated with anticholinergic agents. In recognition of this the FDA-NIMH-MATRICS Guidelines for Clinical Trial Design of Cognitive-Enhancing Drugs require that first-generation antipsychotics can be utilized in clinical trials but only with no additional anticholinergic agents (Buchanan et al. 2011). Over 50% of people with schizophrenia also have other psychiatric or general medical conditions which require treatment (Green et al. 2003; Jones et al. 2004). Many medications for treating these non-psychiatric problems have anticholinergic properties. Pharmacological treatments when aggregated may create a considerable anticholinergic burden that impairs cognition, functional capacity and ability to benefit from psychosocial treatments amongst a group of patients who are already cognitively impaired (Vinogradov et al. 2009; O'Reilly et al. 2015).

To our knowledge only one study has investigated whether anticholinergic burden moderates the effectiveness of behavioural treatments (Vinogradov et al. 2009). Serum anticholinergic activity uniquely accounted for 20% of the variance in change of global cognition following a programme of cognitive remediation therapy, independent of age, IQ or symptom severity. A limitation of this study was that it consisted of patients who were treatment responsive and who volunteered to participate in 50 hours of intensive therapy. Moreover, the study was limited to cognitive outcome and did not examine the effect of anticholinergic burden on functional status. Because cognitive impairment in schizophrenia is an important goal of treatment and because cognitive deficits are known to affect patients' ability to benefit from psychosocial programmes it is necessary

to examine whether anticholinergic burden affects patients' ability to benefit from treatments.

- (1) We hypothesized that the relationship between anticholinergic burden and ability to benefit from psychosocial treatment programmes would be mediated by cognitive ability, when controlling for age, gender, baseline performance on psychosocial treatment programmes, total antipsychotic dose, and symptoms.
- (2) We hypothesized that the mediation relationship between medication, cognition, and programme completion would be specific to anticholinergic burden and not total antipsychotic dose; and that the mediation would be specific to cognition, not to symptoms or functioning when cognition is controlled for.

## Method

This was a naturalistic 3 year prospective observational cohort study of anticholinergic burden, cognitive ability and patient benefit from psychosocial treatment programmes. Data were gathered from 2012 to 2015. Baseline data was gathered in 2012. Follow up data was gathered until the end of 2015. All of the assessments were completed by assessors who were blind to the results of the other assessments

### Participants and setting

The National Forensic Mental Health Service (NFMHS) for Ireland provides specialized care for adults who have a mental disorder and are at risk of harming themselves or others. At the time of the study the NFMHS had 94 secure inpatient beds located on a single campus, the Central Mental Hospital (CMH), and 13 supervised community beds for those discharged subject to conditions. The CMH is the only secure forensic psychiatric hospital for the Republic of Ireland.

Inclusion criteria were having a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and being judged to be able to provide informed consent. A total of 123 patients were invited to participate during 2012. Of these eight patients declined to take part and 15 did not have a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder as assessed by a consultant psychiatrist using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID; First et al. 2002). Of the 100 remaining, 19 patients were discharged and one patient died before they could complete the programme completion assessment at follow-up, one patient was judged to be feigning during the assessment, and one patient did not complete the cognitive assessment, while eight patients did not complete the Positive and

Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS; Kay et al. 1987) assessment. Of the 70 patients that remained in the study 59 patients has a SCID diagnosis of schizophrenia and 11 a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder. There were 66 male (94.3%) and four female (5.7%) patients. The mean age of patients in the study was 39 years (S.D.=11.1).

The mean length of stay at baseline for the 70 patients was 7.73 years (s.D.=8.07), median 5.79. Of the 70 patients included in the study 62 (88%) remained in the study until 2015. Seven patients were discharged during the 3-year follow-up and one patient died. As assessments were carried out every 6 months, the last assessment was taken. Demographic details and sample characteristics are presented in Table 1

### Cognitive assessment

Patients were assessed using the Measurement and Treatment to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) Consensus assessment battery of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia (MCCB), and also the Test of Premorbid Functioning (TOPF-UK; Wechsler, 2011). The mean MCCB composite score was 21.32 (s.D.=14).

Scores for estimated pre-morbid intelligence (TOPF-UK) were not adjusted for education as an estimate of premorbid ability because the symptoms associated with mental disorder can affect educational

attainment. A small number of patients (n=7) could not complete the TOPF-UK because of literacy problems. The mean estimated premorbid IQ was 96.8 (S.D.=12.0).

## Functional performance

The Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS) was completed by a member of the multidisciplinary team responsible for the care of the patient, who was blind to the other assessments including the cognitive assessment (Rybarczyk, 2011). The mean score on the SOFAS was 57 (s.D.=20).

#### Programme completion

The DUNDRUM-3 Programme Completion Scale (D-3) is a structured clinical judgement instrument taken from the DUNDRUM toolkit which assesses whether patients have participated in, engaged and benefited from psychosocial programmes (Kennedy et al. 2010). An independent review found that the scale met requirements for routine outcome measures examining functioning, recovery, risk and placement pathways within forensic mental health populations (Shinkfield & Ogloff, 2014). The D-3 has also been shown to distinguish significantly between groups of patients at different levels of therapeutic security within a forensic setting (Davoren et al. 2012); and it has been shown to predict moves between levels of therapeutic security and to predict conditional discharge from a secure hospital (Davoren et al. 2013).

The D-3 has seven items measuring outcomes for programmes concerning physical health, mental health, drugs and alcohol, problem behaviours, self-care and activities of daily living, education occupation and creativity, and family and social networks. These items are intended to cover the domains of health defined by the WHO (1986), which holds that health is 'a resource for everyday life, not the objective of living. Health is a positive concept emphasizing social and personal resources, as well as physical capacities.' Each item is rated on a 5-point scale with lower scores representing a higher level of participation, sustained engagement and change. Engagement is demonstrated through more than simply having attended all sessions of a programme. This battery of assessments encompasses the range of interventions typically offered for patients with schizophrenia in a modern forensic hospital over a time scale of years rather than months. Annual audits during the period of this study showed that patients achieved a target of 25 h a week of timetabled therapeutic activity and represents 'treatment as usual'.

The mean D-3 score at baseline was 16.5 (s.D.=6.63) which is the total score for all seven items. The mean D-3 at follow up was 15.0 (s.D.=7.36). D-3 change scores were calculated by subtracting the D-3 score at followup from the D-3 at baseline to estimate the strength of the anticholinergic effect. The mean change in D-3 score over the follow-up period was 1.52 (s.D.=5.22).

## Symptom assessment

The PANSS was completed on all 70 patients who remained in the study. The PANSS assessments were completed by a psychiatric registrar and an assistant psychologist trained in its use, who were blind to the cognitive assessments. The mean PANSS Total score at baseline was 64 (s.D.=22).

## Medication

A recent review indicated that evidence is not sufficiently robust for any one of a number of methods of calculating dose equivalence for different antipsychotic medications to be considered as a gold standard, and justification should be offered for the method chosen in any particular study (Patel et al. 2013) A chlorpromazine equivalent (CPZeq) was calculated for each participant as a measure of his/her relative daily dose of antipsychotic medications (Taylor et al. 1994; Woods, 2003; Haddad et al. 2010). CPZeq was selected for calculating antipsychotic dose as it is a widely used and coherent method, appeared to have the best face validity for the purposes of this study and produces

similar results to other approaches such as the British National Formula percentage maximum dose and defined daily dose (Sweileh et al. 2014). The mean CPZeq score at baseline was 529.15 mg/day (s.D. =339.45).

#### Anticholinergic burden

Anticholinergic burden was assessed using the Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden (ACB) scale (Boustani et al. 2008). The ACB scale was developed by a multidisciplinary expert panel based on a systematic review of medications with known anticholinergic activity likely to have an effect on cognition. The ACB scale contains 88 listed medications. Each listed medication can be rated on a 4-point scale (0-3): 0 = no anticholinergic activity, 1 = mild anticholinergic activity, 2 = moderate anticholinergic activity, and 3 = severe anticholinergic activity. The total anticholinergic burden is then calculated by aggregating the score for each listed medication. The ACB scale has been validated in a range of studies (Salahudeen et al. 2015).

The ACB scale was scored from prescription charts by a consultant psychiatrist (P.O.C.) the week prior to the baseline cognitive assessment. The mean ACB score at baseline was 4.40 (s.D.=2.80), mode 3; 75% of the sample had an ACB score <6. Table 2 shows that many of the medications contributing to ACB score were non-psychiatric. No benzodiazepines were prescribed.

## Statistical analysis

Distributions of all measures were screened for outliers and evaluated for normality. One case was assessed as being an outlier on the ACB scale using an outlier labelling method and visual inspection of plots. This case was winsorized to the value of the next highest case not considered an outlier. Four cases were determined to be outliers for the change score on the D-3. These cases were also winsorized to the next highest or lowest case not considered to be an outlier. Following the removal of outliers both the ACB score and the D-3 change scores were normally distributed. The variables age, baseline 2012 D-3 and CPZeq were not normally distributed and were transformed using log10 and Srt transformation. The PANSS Total score and the MCCB Total score met criteria for a normal distribution and did not require any transformations.

A paired sample t test was used to calculate whether there was a significant difference between patients' performance on the D-3 at baseline and 3 years followup. Morris & DeShon's (2002) within-group effect-size formula was used to calculate the magnitude of the effect size over a 3-year period.

SPSS PROCESS macro model 4 (Hayes, 2013) was used to analyse mediation relationships between anticholinergic burden measured by the ACB scale and change of D-3 scores over a 3-year period in scores on the D-3. Unstandardized effect sizes were generated for the mediation models using 10 000 bootstrap samples and 95% bias-corrected confidence intervals were calculated. Age and gender were entered as covariants for all coefficients (Fig. 1).

Six specific mediation analyses were carried out to test the specificity of the relationship between anticholinergic burden, cognition, and patients' ability to participate in and benefit from treatment programmes (change in D-3 score). First, we examined whether cognitive ability as measured by the MCCB Total score would mediate the relationship between anticholinergic burden and change in D-3 score, when controlling

for age, gender, baseline performance on the D-3, psychiatric symptoms as measured by the PANSS Total score, and antipsychotic dose. Second, we examined whether MCCB also mediated an effect of dose (CPZeq) on change in D-3 score as an alternative to a specific effect of ACB. Third, we examined whether psychiatric symptoms as measured by the PANSS Total score would mediate the relationship between anticholinergic burden and change in D-3 score, controlling for age, gender, cognition as measured by the MCCB Total score, antipsychotic dose and baseline performance on the D-3. Fourth, we examined whether baseline functioning as measured by the SOFAS would mediate the relationship between anticholinergic burden and change in D-3 score, when controlling for age, gender, baseline performance on the D-3, cognition as measured by the MCCB Total score,

## Ethical standards

This study was approved by the research ethics and effectiveness committee of the NFMHS and complied with the ethical standards of the relevant national and institutional committees on human experimentation and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2008. All participants gave written informed consent.

### Results

## Magnitude of change over a 3-year period within a forensic mental health service

The mean follow-up period (n = 70) was 2.94 years (s.D.=0.840). The mean change in D-3 score was -1.528 units s.D. 5.22. This was a significant change [paired t=2.448, df=69, p<0.017; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.77-0.28]. The Pearson correlation between baseline programme completion and programme completion at 3-year follow-up was r = 0.726.

The magnitude of effect of 3 years of treatment in a forensic mental health service using D-3 was 0.295 (Cohen's d).

## Anticholinergic burden and change in programme completion scores over 3 years

The MCCB Total score completely mediated the relationship between anticholinergic burden (ACB) and the change in D-3 scores, when controlling for age, gender, baseline programme completion, total antipsychotic dose (CPZeq), and total psychopathology (PANSS). The unstandardized indirect effect of anticholinergic burden as measured by the ACB scale through cognition as measured using the MCCB Total score was -0.27 (95% CI -0.58 to -0.0545) (Table 3) which can be read that for every 1-point increase on the ACB scale changes on the D-3 decrease by -0.27 points.

## Cognition as a mediator between CPZeqs and change in programme completion score

To test the hypothesis that anticholinergic burden and not total antipsychotic dose had a specific effect on cognition which in turn influenced the functional outcome of programme completion we constructed a mediation model where CPZeq was the independent variable and controlled for anticholinergic burden, age, gender, psychopathology, and baseline programme completion. There was no evidence of a direct effect or an indirect effect via cognition for CPZeq on programme completion, when controlling for ACB and other variables.

## Total psychopathology as a mediator between anticholinergic burden and change scores for 3 years and programme completion

To test the hypothesis that the effects of anticholinergic burden were specific to cognition and not psychopathology in general we constructed a model where PANSS Total score was the proposed mediator controlling for age, gender, baseline programme completion, CPZeq, and the MCCB Total score. There was no evidence of an indirect effect of PANSS Total score on change in D-3 score when controlling for other variables.

# SOFAS as a mediator between anticholinergic burden and change in programme completion scores over 3 years

To test the hypothesis that the effect of anticholinergic burden was specific to cognition we constructed a mediation model where the effect of anticholinergic burden on change in D-3 score was mediated by social and occupational functioning (SOFAS) controlling for age, gender, baseline programme completion, MCCB Total Score, CPZeq, and PANSS Total score. Social and occupational functioning as measured by the SOFAS significantly mediated the relationship between ACB and change in programme completion but only when MCCB Total score was removed from the model

# Cognition as a mediator between anticholinergic burden and change in programme completion scores when controlling for social and occupational functioning

When controlling for social and occupational functioning at baseline the MCCB Total score no longer mediated ACB and change in D-3 scores (Table 4).

### Post-hoc analysis

A post-hoc analysis exploring the mediation relationship between ACB, cognition (MCCB Total score) and disability or functioning (SOFAS) was also conducted, controlling for age, gender, psychopathology (PANSS Total) and medication (CPZeq). This analysis again used PROCESS and 10 000 bootstrapped samples. In total the model accounted for 59% of the variance of functioning (SOFAS). The direct effect of ACB on functioning (SOFAS) was not significant (-0.7657, 95% CI –2.4759 to 0.9445). However, the mediated effect via cognition (MCCB) was significant (-1.4651, 95% CI -2.5479 to - 0.6905). For every 1-point increase in anticholinergic burden score, functioning (SOFAS) declined by 1.4651 points.

This effect was specific to cognition being fully mediated by MCCB score. Psychopathology (PANSS Total) did not mediate the relationship between ACB and functioning when cognition was controlled for (-0.4508, 95% CI -1.558 to 0.4978). Further, the effect was specific to anticholinergic burden and not total antipsychotic dose. CPZeq did not affect functioning (SOFAS) via cognition, when ACB was controlled for (0028, 95% CI -0.0026 to 0.0089).

## Discussion

This is the first study to demonstrate that anticholinergic burden has a negative impact on the outcomes of psychosocial treatment programmes for patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. It is noteworthy that many of the medications contributing to the ACB score were non-psychiatric. This adverse effect on psychosocial treatments appears to be mediated specifically through impaired cognitive capacity. The patients within this prospective cohort were cognitively impaired at baseline and had a mean MCCB t score composite of 21.3, which is almost 3 s.D. below the nonclinical mean. A score of this size approximates the cognitive abilities of individuals with a moderate intellectual disability. The cognitive ability of patients within this sample is especially marked given that their estimated premorbid IQ was found to be in the average range. Anticholinergic burden in part appeared to be a determinant of cognitive ability and psychosocial treatment outcomes. Within this study for every 1-unit increase on the ACB scale, patients change in D-3 scores, a scale measuring participation and benefit from psychosocial treatment programmes, decreased by -0.27 points. This decrease needs to be taken in context that the mean change score on the D-3 was 1.52 over the 3-year period (Cohen's d = 0.29). The range of change in D-3 score was, however, very wide (Table 1). Anticholinergic burden impairs cognition, which in turn impairs the ability to benefit from treatment programmes, even when controlling for a range of confounding variables including age, gender, antipsychotic dose and symptom severity.

These findings appear to be specific to anticholinergic burden and cognition. The effect of total antipsychotic dose on change in programme completion score was not mediated by cognition. Since no benzodiazepines were prescribed, these could not have contributed to slowed processing speed. Moreover, total psychopathology (PANSS) did not mediate the effect of anticholinergic burden on change in programme

completion scores. Clinicians' ratings of patients' psychosocial and occupational functioning (SOFAS) also did not mediate the relationship between anticholinergic burden and change in programme completion when cognition was controlled for. But SOFAS did mediate the relationship between anticholinergic burden and programme completion when cognitive ability was removed from the model, presumably because functioning is in part dependent on cognitive capacity.

Our post-hoc analysis demonstrates that anticholinergic burden may impact on patient disability as measured by the SOFAS. This effect again is specific to cognition as demonstrated by mediation analysis. Mediation analysis also shows that the effect of ACB on SOFAS is specific to anticholinergic burden and not total antipsychotic dose (CPZeq). This may have implications for rehabilitation in schizophrenia.

The findings of this study may go some way to explaining why Wunderink et al. (2013) found that dose reduction of antipsychotic medication was linked with superior functional but not symptomatic remission in comparison to maintenance treatment at 7 years follow-up. Reductions in anticholinergic burden may have been the mechanism responsible for this improved psychosocial functioning. It has been suggested that treatments like CBT may not be as helpful for patients with schizophrenia as for some other problems (Jauhar et al. 2014). But psychological interventions have a robust evidence base for a range of disorders (Carr, 2009). One reason for reduced efficacy in schizophrenia may be that cognitive impairments affect patients' ability to attend to, process, store, and use the information offered during psychological interventions (Green et al. 2000; Kurtz, 2011). This study illuminates a possible iatrogenic effect that pharmacotherapy can have on cognition and functioning, which in turn affects the outcome of psychosocial treatment. Cognitive ability and anticholinergic burden should therefore routinely be considered as moderators in clinical trials of psychological therapy for patients with schizophrenia.

We do not propose that anticholinergic burden is the sole cause of cognitive impairments amongst patients with schizophrenia or even the major cause, because these difficulties have been observed in medication naïve patients (Kahn & Keefe, 2013). However our findings do suggest that anticholinergic burden may have adverse effects for patients with schizophrenia. There are studies suggesting that there is a widespread decrease in muscarinic receptors in the brains of people with schizophrenia (Scarr et al. 2013) including postmortem studies (Mancama et al. 2003; Zavitsanou et al. 2004; Newell et al. 2007; Gibbons et al. 2013) and a brain-imaging study (Raedler et al. 2003). Similar to older patients, or those with dementia, people with

schizophrenia are likely to have a vulnerable brain with a paucity of cholinergic neurons (Tune, 2001; Campbell et al. 2009; van Haren et al. 2011; Harvey & Bowie, 2012; Kahn et al. 2015; Gray et al. 2015; Kubota et al. 2015). Physicians are therefore required to conduct careful risk benefit decisions and collaborate with patients regarding the medications they prescribe. The ACB scale may be a useful clinical tool for helping physicians and patients make these decisions. Because verbal intelligence in people with schizophrenia is largely intact (Michel et al. 2013), it may be particularly challenging for physicians to identify declines or impairments in other cognitive domains. Also cognitive screening instruments may not be helpful as they do not take account of a patient's premorbid intellectual ability or have enough sensitivity to change (Lezak et al. 2012). Therefore comprehensive neuropsychological assessment using psychometrically robust and functionally relevant instruments may be important in the planning of care and treatment for people with schizophrenia.

This study has a number of methodological strengths as well as limitations. Strengths include a sample made up of most of a national cohort of forensic patients diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. This sample was followed up over a 3-year period. The use of the MCCB measure for assessing cognitive problems in schizophrenia and controlling for a range of confounders including psychopathology and antipsychotic dose are also strengths. Furthermore, all measurements were conducted independently of each other.

Limitations in this study include the specialist sample consisting entirely of forensic patients which may raise questions regarding the generalizability of the results to other samples of patients with schizophrenia. Patient participation and benefit from psychosocial treatment programmes was measured using the D-3 which has been specifically developed and recommended for this patient group. This scale takes account of the wide range of psychosocial interventions provided for hospitalized patients over a 3-year period. Because no attempt is made here to distinguish between treatment responses to different treatment programmes, the overall effect measured is a measure of 'treatment as usual' with multi-disciplinary delivery of programmes. The sample in this study was crosssectional rather than an incident series of new admissions. To achieve an incident sample of sufficient size, a very prolonged study over as much as a decade would have been required, or a multi-centre study.

This study supports the validity of the ACB scale given its correlations with the MCCB, SOFAS, and D-3. However it is important to point out that a number of criticisms have been levelled at anticholinergic burden scales. There is no consensus for how to

calculate anticholinergic burden. Although a bioassay of serum anticholinergic activity has in the past been considered the gold standard it is only a marker of anticholinergic activity in serum, and not in the brain (Hori et al. 2014). Also dosage is not considered within clinical scales such as the ACB and medications are unlikely to have a simple 0:1:2:3 ratio in relation to dose or in relation to each other. However, a number of studies have found that unit weighting as used in the ACB scale is quite robust for making predictions (Dawes, 1979). Unit weighting performs particularly well where the criterion (in this case central anticholinergic effect) cannot be quantified and this is precisely the case regarding anticholinergic burden (Dawes, 1979). Unit weighting also performs well when there is not a straightforward relationship between the predictor variables and the criterion (Dawes, 1979), and there is considerable individual variation in absorption, distribution, rate of metabolism, formation, and excretion of pharmacologically active metabolites (Pollock, 2000). A third criticism of anticholinergic scales is that there is variability in the quantification of anticholinergic burden across different instruments. However, unit weighting is also viable when it is difficult to develop a regression model because of a larger number of predictors. There are more than 600 medications that have anticholinergic activity (Chew et al. 2008). Finally, because medications with anticholinergic properties do not have a straightforward relationship with cognitive decline the correlation between scales may be a better measure of construct validity than the kappa coefficient (Lertxundi et al. 2013).

Although a number of confounding factors were controlled for there was no attempt to manipulate any variable and therefore the study only approximates a causal design. The value of this study is that it establishes a case for an intervention study using meaningful outcome measures concerning treatment engagement and response, and real world functional outcomes. A number of studies have suggested that discontinuing anticholinergic treatments had a positive effect on cognition among patients with schizophrenia (Baker et al. 1983; Mori et al. 2002; Drimer et al. 2004; Ogino et al. 2011; Desmarais et al. 2014). But no study has yet examined whether improvements in cognition following reduction in anticholinergic burden have in turn affected real-world functioning.

## Conclusion

Anticholinergic burden as measured by the ACB scale had a significant impact on patient ability to participate and benefit from psychosocial treatments within a forensic hospital as measured by change in D-3 score. Anticholinergic burden appears to impair

cognitive ability and real-world functioning, which in turn affects patient ability to participate in and benefit from psychosocial programmes. Physicians need to be mindful of the cumulative effect that psychiatric and other medications can have on cognitive ability, functional capacity, and ability to participate and benefit from psychosocial treatments.

# Background

Co-occurring borderline personality disorder (BPD) features have a marked impact on treatment of patients with mood disorders. Overall, high neuroticism, childhood traumatic experiences (TES) and insecure attachment are plausible aetiological factors for BPD. However, their relationship with BPD features specifically among patients with mood disorders remains unclear. We investigated these relationships among unipolar and bipolar mood disorder patients.

# Methods

As part of the Helsinki University Psychiatric Consortium study, the McLean Screening Instrument (MSI), the Experiences in Close Relationships-Revised (ECR-R), the Short Five (S5) and the Trauma and Distress Scale (TADS) were filled in by patients with mood disorders (n=282) in psychiatric care. Correlation coefficients between total scores of scales and their dimensions were estimated, and multivariate regression (MRA) and mediation analyses were conducted.

#### Results

Spearman's correlations were strong (rho=0.58; p<0.001) between total scores of MSI and S5 Neuroticism and moderate (rho=0.42; p<0.001) between MSI and TADS as well as between MSI and ECR-R Attachment Anxiety. In MRA, young age, S5 Neuroticism and TADS predicted scores of MSI (p<0.001). ECR-R Attachment Anxiety mediated 33% (CI = 17-53%) of the relationships between TADS and MSI.

### Limitations

Cross-sectional questionnaire study.

#### Conclusions

We found moderately strong correlations between self-reported BPD features and concurrent high neuroticism, reported childhood traumatic experiences and Attachment Anxiety also among patients with mood disorders. Independent predictors for BPD features include young age, frequency of childhood traumatic experiences and high neuroticism. Insecure attachment may partially mediate the relationship between childhood traumatic experiences and borderline features among mood disorder patients.

#### Introduction

Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is one of the most clinically significant personality disorders in psychiatric settings. It is associated with substantial mental and physical disability, significant treatment utilization and high risk of mortality by suicide (Grant, et al, 2008; McGlashan, et al, 2000; Paris, 1993; Zanarini, et al, 2000b).

The aetiology and pathogenesis of BPD have been investigated and debated for decades (Gabbard, 2005; Gunderson and Singer, 1975; Gunderson, 2009; Lieb, et al, 2004). Current multifactorial aetiological models highlight the interactions of psychosocial, genetic and neurobiological factors in the pathogenesis of BPD (Leichsenring, et al, 2011). Among psychosocial factors, childhood traumatic experiences (TEs) and insecure attachment have received the greatest empirical support (Mosquera, et al, 2014; Zanarini, et al, 2000a; Zanarini, et al, 2000b).

Patients with BPD tend to report considerably more TEs in childhood than patients with other psychiatric disorders (Yen, et al, 2002). An association between childhood sexual abuse experiences and BPD has been extensively debated (Herman, et al, 1989; Paris and Zweig-Frank, 1992). Moreover, previous studies have indicated that the severity and frequency of TEs correlate with the severity of borderline pathology (Silk, et al, 1995; Zanarini, et al, 2002). However, despite the large body of studies illustrating high prevalence of childhood TEs in BPD patients, the causal role of TEs in BPD symptoms remains controversial (Bornovalova, et al, 2013; Paris, 1998).

One of the suggested mechanisms underlying influence of childhood TEs on the manifestation of BPD in adulthood is insecure attachment style (Fonagy, et al, 2000; Gunderson and Lyons-Ruth, 2008). Numerous studies have demonstrated a clear association between BPD features and insecure attachment using both categorical and dimensional models of attachment (Aaronson, et al, 2006; Agrawal, et al, 2004a; Levy, et al, 2005). Particularly, patients with BPD often demonstrate unresolved, fearful and preoccupied attachment styles (Agrawal, et al, 2004b). Using dimensional self-report measures of attachment, many studies have shown a strong association between BPD and Attachment Anxiety, while associations with Avoidant Attachment remain inconsistent (Choi-Kain, et al, 2009;

Scott, et al, 2009). Attachment Anxiety is characterized by hypersensitivity to rejection and fear of abandonment – both core symptoms in BPD (Campbell and Marshall, 2011). This demonstrates partial overlap between adult Attachment Anxiety and BPD features (Minzenberg, et al, 2006). Some studies have also shown the important role of genetic factors in individual differences in attachment styles (Crawford, et al, 2007; Picardi, et al, 2011). However, while adult attachment anxiety appears to be an important factor for developing BPD, the predictive value or causality of anxious attachment in BPD remains uncertain (Scott, et al, 2009; Scott, et al, 2013).

The view of the fundamentally dimensional nature of personality disorders has received substantial empirical support (Clark, 2007; Gotzsche-Astrup and Moskowitz, 2016). The five-factor model (FFM) (Costa, 1991) defines five broad personality dimensions that show moderate heritability (Distel, et al, 2009). In the context of FFM, patients with BPD tend to score low on Agreeableness and Conscientiousness and high on Neuroticism (Morey and Zanarini, 2000; Samuel and Widiger, 2008; Saulsman and Page, 2004). Neuroticism, in turn, is associated with mood, anxiety and substance use disorders and is probably related to high comorbidity of BPD and these disorders (Ormel, et al, 2013). Moreover, neuroticism has been shown to correlate with psychological distress and suicidal behaviour – both prevalent in BPD (Ormel, et al, 2013). –

BPD is often comorbid with mood disorders (Links and Eynan, 2013; Mantere, et al, 2006; McGlashan, et al, 2000; Melartin, et al, 2002a; Riihimaki, et al, 2014) and according to self-report, symptoms of BPD are abundantly present in patients with mood disorders (Baryshnikov, et al, 2015; Baryshnikov, et al, 2016a). However, the validity of personality assessment in patients with mood disorders is debatable (Morey, et al, 2010; Zimmerman, 1994). Some studies have shown notable effects of mood states on personality traits (Griens, et al, 2002; Hirschfeld, et al, 1983), while others suggest that personality disorder diagnoses established during depressive episode are a valid reflection of personality pathology (Morey, et al, 2010). One Finnish study described relatively poor categorical stability of concurrent personality disorder assigned during unipolar depression when dimensional stability was moderate (Melartin, et al, 2010).

The origins of self-reported features of BPD, as well as their risk factors in patients seeking treatment for mood disorders are incompletely understood. Our previous study indicated that self-reported features mood instability and impulsivity are shared between BPD and bipolar disorders (Baryshnikov, et al, 2015). Overall, mood instability among mood disorder patients may be also related to inherited vulnerability to emotional dysregulation (Koenigsberg, 2010; Peng, et al, 2015; Stein, et al, 2009). Thus, there is uncertainty whether self-reported features of BPD in patients with mood disorder are intrinsically related to underlying concurrent borderline pathology.

Nevertheless, mood disorder patients with both clinical and subclinical features of BPD have been reported to demonstrate greater impairment in several functional domains than patients without BPD features (Zimmerman, et al, 2012). Consequently, recognition and treatment of subclinical BPD features in mood disorder patients are clinically relevant.

Psychosocial interventions are recommended as the primary treatment for BPD (Bateman, et al, 2015). Several evidence-based psychotherapies, mentalization-based treatment and schema therapy are based on the attachment theory (Fonagy, et al, 2000; Kellogg and Young, 2006). In the framework of attachment theory, the insecure attachment is suggested as an explanatory link between childhood TEs and BPD (Fonagy, et al, 2000; Johnston, et al, 2009; Kellogg and Young, 2006). The majority of studies demonstrating the beneficial effect of these psychotherapies have been conducted in patients with clinical diagnoses of BPD (Bateman, et al, 2015; Stoffers, et al, 2012). As mentioned previously, treatment of self-reported BPD features at both clinical and subclinical levels is clinically relevant. On the other hand, despite increasing use of mentalization-based treatment and schema therapy in clinical practice, little is known about the relationships between self-reported BPD features, dimensions of attachment and childhood TEs.

In this study, we aimed to investigate relationships between self-reported features of BPD, childhood TEs, adulthood attachment styles and neuroticism in patients with mood disorders. We hypothesized that a) childhood TEs, high attachment anxiety and high neuroticism are associated with the selfreported features of BPD in mood disorder patients and avoidant dimensions of

attachment may mediate the effect of childhood TEs on the self-reported features of BPD. Therefore, we investigated associations between self-reported BPD, TEs and attachment style, examined factors predicting the prevalence of self-reported BDP features with mood disorders and examined the mediating effect of self-reported attachment styles on the relationships between self-reported BPD features and TEs in patients with mood disorders.

#### Methods

The background and methodology of HUPC have been reported in detail elsewhere (Aaltonen, et al, 2016; Baryshnikov, et al, 2016b)

#### The Helsinki University Psychiatric Consortium (HUPC)

This investigation is part of the HUPC study, a collaborative research project between the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Helsinki; the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services of the National Institute for Health and Welfare; the Department of Social Services and Health Care, City of Helsinki; and the Department of Psychiatry, University of Helsinki University Hospital. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Helsinki University Central Hospital ..

#### Setting

The study was conducted in 10 community mental health centres, three psychiatric inpatient units and one day-hospital, all offering specialized secondary public mental health services in the metropolitan area of Helsinki between 12.1.2011 and 20.12.2012.

#### Sampling

Inclusion criteria were patients' age ≥ 18 years and provision of informed consent. Patients with mental retardation, neurodegenerative disorders and insufficient Finnish language skills were

excluded. Stratified patient sampling selection was performed by identifying all patients within a certain day or week in a unit or by randomly drawing eligible patients from patient lists. Of the 902 eligible patients with mood, neurotic or personality disorders, 372 refused to participate and 216 were lost for other reasons. In addition, 31 patients with other lifetime diagnoses were excluded.

#### Clinical diagnoses

The validity of the clinical diagnoses assigned by the attending physicians was critically evaluated by the authors (IB, KA, MK, BK) by re-examining all available information from patient records. The validated clinical diagnoses were based on the ICD-10-DCR (World Health Organization, 1992), Lifetime principal diagnosis was assigned. Although there is no division of BD into types I (BD-I) and II (BD-II) in the ICD-10, we subtyped patients into these categories according to the DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). This distinction is established clinical practice in Finland and included in the national BD treatment guidelines.

#### Description of patients

Altogether 282 patients participated in the study. Their mean age was 42.2 ± 13.1 years, and 209 (74.1%) were female. There were 109 (38.7%) patients. There were 183 patients with Unipolar Depression (UD) (F32-F33) (mean age 41.4 ± 13.3 years) and 99 with Bipolar Disorder (BD) (F31, mean age 43.7 ± 12.7 years). In patients with BD, 36 (36.3%) had type I (BD-I), 55 (55.5%) type II (BD-II) and 8 (8%) Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Patients with BD-NOS and BD-2 were allocated to the same group. 17 patients with BP had also comorbid BPD; among patients with UD 39 patients had comorbid BPD. In terms of age and gender, sample distribution did not differ from patients with the same diagnoses treated in 2011 and 2012 in psychiatric care organizations.

#### Trauma and Distress Scale (TADS)

TADS is a self-report questionnaire that measures childhood trauma and distress experiences through 43 items (Patterson, et al, 2002). The TADS items measure symptoms in five main domains: emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional neglect and physical neglect. Each item is rated on a

four-point Likert scale from 1 to 4 (0 = never, 1 = rarely, 2 = sometimes, 3 = often, 4 = nearly always). TADS has been validated in Finland (Salokangas, et al, 2016). Cronbach's alpha for TADS' total scores was 0.6. Cronbach's alphas were 0.8 for emotional abuse, 0.9 for sexual abuse, 0.9 for sexual abuse, 0.9 for emotional neglect and 0.7 for physical neglect.

#### Experiences in Close Relationships – Revised (ECR-R)

The ECR-R questionnaire is a self-report measure of adult romantic attachment dimensions during lifetime romantic relationships (Fraley, et al, 2000). It includes 36 items that are scored on a sevenpoint Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). The ECR-R assesses two dimensions of attachment (18 items for each scale): Attachment Anxiety and Attachment Avoidance. Higher mean scores indicate greater degrees of anxiety and/or avoidance, and consequently lower levels of attachment security. Cronbach's alpha was 0.9 for Attachment Anxiety and 0.9 for Attachment Avoidance. Although the ECR-R measures the adulthood attachment style, it is assumed to reflect attachment style established in childhood, according to the attachment theory (Fonagy, et al, 2000).

#### Short Five (S5)

S5 is a 60-item self-report questionnaire constructed for measuring 30 facets of the Five-Factor Model (Konstabel, et al, 2012). These items measure five personality factors: neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness and conscientiousness. Cronbach's alpha for neuroticism was 0.9, for extraversion 0.9, for openness 0.8, for agreeableness 0.7 and for conscientiousness 0.8.

#### McLean Screening Instrument (MSI)

The MSI is a ten-item questionnaire designed according to DSM-IV diagnostic criteria to screen for BPD (Zanarini, et al, 2003). It has been translated into Finnish and validated in Finland (Melartin, et al, 2009). Each item requires a ""yes/no"" response. Each positive item indicates the presence of BPD symptoms. The Kuder-Richardson 20 coefficient for MSI was 0.747.

#### Statistical Analysis

The independent samples t-test was conducted to compare differences between two continuous variables. Possible differences between three or more continuous variables were assessed using

ANOVA tests. For variables that met a required assumption of homogeneity, the Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference (Tukey's HSD) was used in Post Hoc analyses, otherwise we used the Games-Howell test. The correlation analysis was executed between scales' total scores and their factors. Spearman's correlation coefficient was estimated between continuous variables. To protect from Type I Error in correlation and regression analyses, the Bonferroni corrections were conducted, dividing the original significance level by the number of analyses on the dependent variable. The correlation from 0.6 to 0.79 was classified as ""strong"", from 0.40 to 0.59 as ""moderate"", from 0.20 to 0.39 as ""weak"" and less than 0.2 as ""very weak"".

Hierarchical multivariate regression analysis was used to assess putative risk factors for self-reported features of BPD. To adjust for possible confounding effects of age, sex and concurrent depressive symptoms on the reporting of childhood's TEs, Attachment, and neuroticism, the model 1 included these variables. Due to moderate correlations between scores of TADS ECR-R Anxious Attachment and S5 neuroticism, they were placed in different model 1 (age, sex, BDI), model 2 (TADS (selfreported childhood traumatic experiences), models 3 (ECR-R (self-reported attachment style)) and model 4 (S5 (self-reported neuroticism).

The mediation analysis was conducted using the bootstrapping method with the bias-corrected confidence estimates (Mackinnon, et al, 2004). The independent variable was TADS, depended variable MSI and mediator variable ECR-R anxious. The 95% confidence interval of the indirect effects was obtained with 5000 bootstrap resamples (Preacher and Hayes, 2008). The analyses were performed by using SPSS (IBM Corp. Released 2013).
### Results

### Total scores

Traumatic experiences were widely present, as shown by the TADS scores (Table 1). Means of total scores of TADS, ECR-R and S5 are given in Table 2. No differences in mean scores of TADS and ECR-R between patients with BD-1, BD-2 and UD emerged. As expected, patients with BD-1 scored higher on the S5 extraversion scale than others (p<0.001 in Post Hoc by Tukey's HSD), and patients with BD-2 scored higher on the MSI than others (p<0.001 in Post Hoc by Tukey's HSD).

### Correlation analysis of self-reported scales

Spearman's correlations between the scores of TADS, ECR-R, S5 and MSI are provided in Table 3. A strong correlation emerged between total scores of MSI and S5 neuroticism (rho=0.6; p<0.001). Correlations between MSI scores and TADS dimensions were moderate (rho varied from 0.3 to 0.4; p<0.001). ECR-R anxious score correlated moderately with MSI scores (rho=0.4; p<0.001).

### Hierarchical Multiple Regression (HMR)

Altogether 23% of responders were unable to provide ECR-R data, probably due to a lack of intimate relationships. The ECR-R sample therefore comprised 219 individuals. In Model 1 R2 = 0.238, F (3, 215) = 22.4., p < 0.0001, age and BDI had a significant weight (see Table 4). The addition of TADS (Model 2) led to a significant increase in R2 by 0.064, F (1, 214) = 23.2, P < 0.0001, with significant weights for age, BDI and TADS. The addition of ECR-R Anxious and Avoidant (Model 3) led to a significant increase in R2 by 0.060, F (2, 211) = 20.1, P < 0.0001, with significant weights for age, BDI, ECR-R anxious and TADS. The addition of S5 (neuroticism) (Model 4) led to a significant increase in R2 by 0.089, F (1, 210) = 24.8, P < 0.0001, with significant weights for age, TADS and S5 neuroticism. The HMR was conducted also separately for patients with UD and BD without notable differences. Moreover, the results remained similar when the HMR was conducted separately for patients with mood disorder with and without comorbid BPD (see supplement table 1).

### Mediation analysis

ECR avoidant scores were not used in mediation analysis because they did not predict MSI scores. A mediating effect of Attachment Anxiety (ECR-R anxious score) was detected for the relationships between childhood TEs assessed by TADS and BPD features assessed by MSI. The indirect effect of TADS on MSI through ECR-R anxious score was significant (B=0.02; Cl=0.01 to 0.03). The direct effect of TADS on MSI was smaller (B=0.04; t (216)=4.3; p<0.0001) than the total effect of TADS on MSI (B=0.06; t (216) = 6.5; p≤0.0001), suggesting a partial mediating effect of ECR-R (see Figure 1). Specifically, 33% (CI=17=53%) of the association between TADS and MSI was estimated to be mediated by ECR-R anxious score. In sensitivity analyses including separately the UD, BP-1 or BP-2 patients; and patients with mood disorders with and without comorbid BPD; the mediation findings remains similar (see supplement table 2). In addition analysis was repeated using a control variable BDI. No significant changes in the relationships between TADS, ECR-R Anxious Attachment and MSI emerged. Moreover, a moderated mediation analysis was conducted, using BDI as a mediator on relations between a) TADS and ECR-R Anxious Attachment; b) t ECR-R Anxious Attachment and MSI; c) TADS and MSI. No significant interactions between BDI as moderator and TADS; ECR-R Anxious Attachment; and MSI emerged (data available by request).

#### Discussion

We investigated psychiatric patients with unipolar or bipolar mood disorders and correlates of their self-reported features of borderline personality disorder (BPD). We found strong correlations of selfreported BPD features with self-reported neuroticism and moderate correlations with self-reported childhood traumatic experiences (TEs) and with adulthood Attachment Anxiety. As hypothesized, in the mediation analysis we observed self-reported Attachment Anxiety to mediate one-third (33%) of the relationship between self-reported childhood TEs and self-reported BPD both in patients with mood disorders overall and in the diagnostic subgroups separately.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine associations between self-reported features of BPD measured as a dimensional entity and self-reported childhood traumatic experiences and attachment anxiety in mood disorder patients. Strengths of our study were the relatively large and representative number of mood disorder patients recruited from specialized psychiatric care and the extensive data of self-reported symptoms. Moreover, we investigated a comprehensive set of self-reported data of childhood traumatic experiences and attachment style; both are important domains in the aetiology of BPD (Leichsenring, et al, 2011).

Some limitations of the study should, however, also be noted. First, the response rate was only 43%, perhaps because the study was conducted in busy routine clinical practice. Moreover, some volunteers were lost due to technical reasons and the survey was extensive and time-consuming. Nevertheless, an analysis of representativeness indicated no significant differences in terms of age or sex between our cohort and the whole patient population within specialized psychiatric care of the catchment area (data not shown). Furthermore, in terms of demographic characteristics our cohort did not differ from screening-based representative cohorts from the same area (Mantere, et al, 2004; Melartin, et al, 2002b). Second, the clinical diagnoses were not verified with structured clinical diagnostic interviews. However, all patients had been diagnosed with mood disorders in specialized psychiatric settings, and all information was re-evaluated by the authors. In addition, the focus of this study was on dimensionally self-reported data, not on categorical diagnoses. Third, 23% of patients were unable to respond to ECR-R, possibly due to lack of romantic relationships. Overall 38.7% of the patients were

not cohabiting, which may indicate loneliness and possibly limited experience of or lack of recent romantic relationships. Fourth, the results of our study are based on self-report scales. Numerous studies have shown that patients with mood disorders often demonstrate impairments in social cognition (Hoertnag) and Hofer, 2014), autobiographical memory disruptions (Talarowska, et al, 2016) and distortions in self-reflections (Philippi and Koenigs, 2014). These factors might affect the patients' ability to assess their own symptoms. Moreover, largely described symptoms of dissociation (Mosquera, et al, 2014; Vermetten and Spiegel, 2014) may affect a patient's ability to recall events in childhood. Fifth, for purposes of this study, we assumed a causal relationship between self-reported TEs and features of BPD, to betested in mediational analysis. However, although the retrospectively evaluated temporal sequence of exposures and outcomes is theoretically plausible, causality of such relationships cannot be shown in a cross-sectional study. Moreover, the temporal sequence of exposures and outcome remains uncertain, and possibility of reverse order cannot be excluded. At least in some cases or to some extent, self-reported adult attachment style could also be a consequence rather than cause of BPD symptoms. Sixth, we did not measure affective temperaments (Rihmer, et al, 2010) in this study, and therefore, cannot evaluate possible conceptual and clinical overlap between various affective temperaments and self-reported BPD features or overlap in their putative risk factors. Seventh, we have not considered the potential impact of mood state on reporting of the BPD features.

The high prevalence of childhood TEs in patients with mental disorders is widely acknowledged (Hasin and Grant, 2015; Infurna, et al, 2016). Moreover, the complexity and severity of childhood TEs were shown to be associated with the severity of psychopathology and with greater impairment in several domains in a range of mental disorders (Hasin and Grant, 2015; Martin-Blanco, et al, 2014; Nusslock and Miller, 2015; Verdolini, et al, 2015). Our study indicated that self-reported TEs are prevalent among patients with mood disorders, and a substantial proportion of patients with mood disorders reported that the TEs were present ""often"" or ""always"" during their childhood. Moreover, patients with mood disorders appeared to report TEs more often than non-psychiatric individuals investigated in an earlier study (Salokangas, et al, 2016). Moreover, the mean score of the ""Sexual

abuse"" dimension of the TADS was higher in patients with mood disorders (1.9±4.0) than in individuals from the general population (0.5±1.8). Interestingly, patients with clinical high risk for psychosis received the same mean score of ""sexual abuse"" of TADS (1.9±4.4) (Tikka, et al, 2013) as the patients with mood disorders in our study (1.9±4.0).

The relationships between childhood TEs and borderline pathology remain debated (Goodwin, 2005; Lonie, 1993; Murray, 1993). On the one hand, individuals with BPD tend to report a high number of traumatic events in childhood (Battle, et al, 2004; Lobbestael, et al, 2010), but, on the other hand, the degree of effect of TEs on clinical manifestation of BPD is somewhat uncertain (Fossati, et al, 1999; Laporte, et al, 2011a; Paris, 1998). In our study, as expected, self-reported childhood TEs correlated moderately with self-reported BPD symptoms.

However, not all children exposed to TEs develop later personality disorders and not all patients with BPD report TEs in childhood (Paris, 1998). The maladaptive variants of the normal temperamental dimension of personality, such as high neuroticism, may contribute to the development of BPD (Samuel, et al, 2013). Our study indicated that self-reported symptoms of BPD correlated strongly with neuroticism. Moreover, we have shown that both self-reported childhood TEs and high neuroticism may independently predict self-reported symptoms of BPD in patients with mood disorders. A previous study indicated that low neuroticism and absence of childhood sexual abuse are significant predictors for earlier remission of BPD (Zanarini, et al, 2006). Thus, the presence or absence of TEs and the degree of neuroticism may aggravate or reduce the severity of concurrent borderline pathology also in patients with mood disorders.

Mechanisms mediating the possible influence of childhood TEs on BPD are poorly understood. Among several hypotheses, impaired attachment style has received much attention (Fruzzetti, et al, 2005; Laporte, et al, 2011b; Rutter, et al, 2006; Thatcher, et al, 2005) (Fonagy, et al, 2000; Minzenberg, et al, 2006). According to the attachment theory (Bowlby, 1982), early experiences with caregivers result in ""internal working models"" or mental representations of self and others. These ""internal working models"" tend to persist into adulthood as general representations with respect to close relationships

(Fraley, et al, 2000). In the framework of attachment theory, insecure attachment was suggested as an explanatory link between childhood TEs and BPD (Fonagy, et al, 2000; Johnston, et al, 2009; Kellogg and Young, 2006). However, clinical studies demonstrating a mediating effect of insecure attachment between childhood TEs and borderline pathology are scarce. Furthermore, some of studies have been conducted using a non-clinical population (Alexander, et al, 1998) or a categorical diagnostic approach (Fonagy, et al, 1996; Minzenberg, et al, 2006). Our findings were consistent with a partial mediating effect of adulthood Attachment Anxiety on the relationship between childhood TEs and self-reported BPD features among patients with mood disorders.

We demonstrated that after controlling for childhood TEs and young age, self-reported adulthood attachment anxiety appears to be an independent predictor of self-reported BPD features. In contrast, after controlling for childhood TEs, young age and neuroticism, adulthood Attachment Anxiety was not a significant predictor. These findings can be interpreted from different perspectives. First, our results are congruent with studies indicating that interactions between biological temperamental and environmental factors, such as childhood TEs, play an essential role in the development of BPD (Beauchaine, et al, 2009; Crowell, et al, 2009). In addition, one previous study suggested a mediating role of neuroticism in the relationship between childhood adversities and psychopathology (Laporte, et al, 2011b). Moreover, we indicated a significant mediating effect of neuroticism between childhood TEs and BPD features in mood disorders also (data available on request). Second, possible phenomenological overlap-between adulthood Attachment Anxiety and neuroticism may to some extent affect our results.

### Conclusions

A strong association exists between self-reported childhood TEs and self-reported BPD features in patients with mood disorders. Young age, the frequency of TEs and the degree of neuroticism are significant independent predictors of concurrent self-reported features of BPD in mood disorder

patients. Self-reported attachment anxiety may partly mediate the association between self-reported

childhood TEs and features of BPD in patients with mood disorders.

#### Highlights

- Features of borderline personality disorder (BPD) are prevalent in mood disorders
- Traumatic childhood experiences (TEs) may predispose to insecure attachment
- · Insecure attachment may predispose to BPD features
- These factors likely predispose to BPD features also in mood disorder patients
- Insecure attachment partially mediates relationship between TEs and BPD features
- Young age and high neuroticism also associate to BPD features in mood disorders"

### Subtle Perceptions of Male Sexual Orientation Influence Occupational Opportunities

Theories linking the literatures on stereotyping and human resource management have proposed that individuals may enjoy greater success obtaining jobs congruent with stereotypes about their social categories or traits. Here, we explored such effects for a detectable, but not obvious, social group distinction: male sexual orientation. Bridging previous work on prejudice and occupational success with that on social perception, we found that perceivers rated gay and straight men as more suited to professions consistent with stereotypes about their groups (nurses, pediatricians, and English teachers vs. engineers, managers, surgeons, and math teachers) from mere photos of their faces. Notably, distinct evaluations of the gay and straight men emerged based on perceptions of their faces with no explicit indication of sexual orientation. Neither perceivers' expertise with hiring decisions nor diagnostic information about the targets eliminated these biases, but encouraging fair decisions did contribute to partly ameliorating the differences. Mediation analysis further showed that perceptions of the targets' sexual orientations and facial affect accounted for these effects. Individuals may therefore infer characteristics about individuals' group memberships from their faces and use this information in a way that meaningfully influences evaluations of their suitability for particular jobs.

People attend to differences in social categories and one's appearance plays an active role in this. The visual salience of distinctions based on age, race, and sex allows perceivers to categorize others quickly, efficiently, automatically, and accurately, but also facilitates stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination (Macrae & Bodenhausen, 2000). A vast literature has documented myriad ways in which people use information about these dimensions to form assumptions about others that favor some groups at the expense of others (see Fiske, 2000).

Despite the ease with which people typically infer age, race, and sex, many important social distinctions are not so easily extracted from appearance. Group memberships like religious affiliation,

political ideology, and sexual orientation, for example, are perceptually ambiguous. Nevertheless, people perceive these characteristics better than chance (see Tskhay & Rule, 2013, for review). Although perceptually ambiguous social categories also form the basis for group favoritism and discrimination in concept (e.g., Rule, Ambady, Adams, & Macrae, 2007), little work has examined how the visual features that distinguish them might support prejudice and discrimination in behavior. That is, do people discriminate against members of perceptually ambiguous groups even when those group memberships are not obvious or explicit? Here, we explored how perceptions of one ambiguous dimension (male sexual orientation) might promote biases that could impact individuals' professional success.

#### Facial Cues to Sexual Orientation

People need to perceive sexual orientation for it to affect their judgments. Though rates of accuracy for sexual orientation pale compared with more obvious distinctions like race (see Remedios, Chasteen, Rule, & Plaks, 2011), people can indeed judge men's and women's sexual orientation from photos of their faces and even from individual facial features, such as pairs of eyes (e.g., Rule, Ambady, Adams, & Macrae, 2008). Moreover, these judgments share many of the cognitive features of perceptually obvious groups: people perceive sexual orientation rapidly (as briefly as 40 ms), automatically, and without awareness when seeing a face (e.g., Rule, Ambady, & Hallett, 2009). These cognitions also show evidence of ingroup bias: One study suggested that straight men terminated their processing of gay men after seeing their faces without explicitly knowing their sexual orientation, consequently recognizing the faces of other straight ingroup members significantly better than gay outgroup members in a surprise memory test (Rule et al., 2007). Evidence thus suggests that people perceive sexual orientation from minimal visual cues and that this information guides subsequent processing of them. But people often lack awareness that they can even perceive sexual orientation (e.g., Rule et al., 2007, 2008; Rule, Macrae, & Ambady, 2009). Moreover, the consequences of these perceptions remain unexplored. Here, we examined how indirectly construing targets as gay and straight might affect outcomes related to their professional success.

#### Influence of Facial Information on Life Outcomes

Studies have already demonstrated that direct perceptions of sexual orientation can influence a person's professional opportunities. A large literature has shown that manipulations of job applicants' group membership (including sexual orientation) results in negative evaluations and outcomes for minority group members when this information is explicit or relatively obvious (e.g., via resumés; Bertrand & Mullainathan, 2004). Extending this to interpersonal interactions, Hebl and colleagues showed that manipulating confederates' alleged sexual orientation affected their experiences when applying for jobs (e.g., Hebl, Foster, Mannix, & Dovidio, 2002; Hebl & Mannix, 2003). Moreover, stigmas marked by overt visual cues (e.g., a facial disfigurement) can also negatively impact evaluations of job candidates (Madera & Hebl, 2012).

Previous research has also illustrated that facial appearance can impact one's personal and professional success in several domains (e.g., election outcomes, length of life, and leadership success; Abel & Kruger, 2010; Rule & Ambady, 2010). Obvious cues to group membership play an important role in this. A study by Blair, Judd, and Chapleau (2004), for example, found that the Afrocentricity of defendants' facial features biased Florida judges' sentencing decisions. Although Black and White defendants received comparable sentences, the more Afrocentric-looking defendants of both races encountered harsher punishments. The authors concluded that this may constitute evidence of racism that implicitly skews individuals' perceptions while explicitly appearing egalitarian (see also Dovidio & Gaertner, 2000). Eberhardt, Davies, Purdie-Vaughns, and Johnson (2006) reported similar effects: More stereotypically Black-looking convicts received the death penalty more often than less stereotypically Black-looking convicts in Pennsylvania courts. Related work has found that litigants' facial maturity, attractiveness, and perceived trustworthiness influence their outcomes in stereotype-consistent ways in both civil and criminal court cases (Stewart, 1980; Wilson & Rule, 2015; Zebrowitz & McDonald, 1991).

Appearance even influences the perceptions of people wellinformed by more relevant and diagnostic information. Experimental participants who learned about targets' honesty still judged trustworthiness based largely on facial appearance (Rudoy & Paller, 2009; Rule, Slepian, & Ambady, 2012) and perceivers routinely ignore base-rate information when forming impressions of others along a variety of dimensions (Olivola & Todorov, 2010). In a comprehensive demonstration of the effect of facial

appearance over better knowledge, Blair, Chapleau, and Judd (2005) presented participants with numerous statements about target individuals' past aggressive and nonaggressive behaviors. Despite repeated learning, participants still evaluated targets with more Afrocentric features as more aggressive-consistent with stereotypes. Similarly, Rule, Tskhay, Freeman, and Ambady (2014) iteratively trained participants to learn targets' ostensible sexual orientations until they reached perfect performance, only to find that the participants reverted back to their initial face-based impressions after a short break. Therefore, facial appearance persistently influences thought and judgment when perceivers possess more informative and diagnostic knowledge, and even for highly consequential outcomes. Moreover, these effects occur not only in laboratory studies but also in field experiments documenting actual events in the real world. Little is known about how nonobvious on indirect facial cues to social categories affect life outcomes, however.

#### Stereotyping and Employment

To help fill this gap, we examined whether stereotypes about sexual orientation might lead to a preference for gay and straight men in particular professional positions. We expected that individuals would deem both gay and straight men as better suited to positions fitting assumptions about their group membership, and that this would occur even when sexual orientation was not communicated explicitly (e.g., Hebl et al., 2002) but, rather, by very subtle and minimal cues in facial appearance. Indeed, previous research has found that stereotypes guide perceptions of individuals' suitability and success in professional positions. Role Congruity Theory (Eagly & Karau, 2002), for example, proposes that men stereotypically occupy agentic social and occupational roles whereas women tend to occupy more communal and caretaking roles, consistent with gender norms ascribed to the sexes. Similarly, Heilman's (1983) Lack of Fit Model suggests that individuals whose characteristics (often based on group stereotypes) do not match those typical for a given position will be considered unsuitable for it; for example, women in leadership positions (Eagly & Karau, 2002).

Although scholars have principally applied these theories to gender stereotypes in past research (e.g., Heilman, 2001), evidence suggests that they may also pertain to sexual orientation (e.g., Horvath & Ryan, 2003; Pichler, Varma, & Bruce, 2010; Tilcsik, 2011). Pichler et al. (2010), for example, presented participants with resumés of men and women identified as gay/lesbian or straight for a sales manager or registered nurse position. They found that people rated ""misfit"" job candidates (e.g., a heterosexual man applying for a nursing post) as less suitable than candidates whose group membership matched the gender stereotypes related to the respective jobs. Gender typicality therefore represents a critical component of the evaluation of a person's fit for a given job or social role. People accordingly tend to consider feminine people (such as gay men and straight women) better suited to stereotypically communal jobs and roles, and masculine people (e.g., straight men and lesbian women) better suited for stereotypically agentic positions in work and society (e.g., Tilcsik, Anteby, & Knight, 2015).

#### Relationship Between Sexual Orientation and Gender

Similar mismatches also influence people's perceptions of sexual orientation. For centuries, Western culture has viewed gay men and lesbian women through the lens of gender inversion (i.e., the notion that they are simply men and women trapped in women's and men's bodies, respectively; Ulrichs, 1870/1997). Thus, people stereotype gay men as feminine and lesbian women as masculine-incongruent with the norms for their sexes (e.g., Kite & Deaux, 1987). Incidentally, these stereotypes may hold a kernel of truth. A host of studies has found that, on average, gay men behave more femininely than straight men, for example (e.g., Rieger, Linsenmeier, Gygax, Garcia, & Bailey, 2010). Indeed, various nonverbal manifestations of gender (i.e., masculinity/femininity) can accurately cue targets' sexual orientations, ranging from body motion (Johnson, Gill, Reichman, & Tassinary, 2007) to facial structure (Freeman, Johnson, Ambady, & Rule, 2010; Skorska, Geniole, Vrysen, McCormick, & Bogaert, 2015). Based on these findings, and considering the theories reviewed above, we hypothesized that people would perceive gay men as more suited to communal/feminine professions and straight men as more suited to agentic/masculine professions from mere photos of their faceseven individuals with professional experience making hiring decisions.

#### Perceptions Beyond Gender

Perceptions of masculinity/femininity do not perfectly correlate with sexual orientation, however. Although masculinity/femininity explains a sizable portion of the variance in perceivers' judgments of sexual orientation, other cues show independent influences. For instance, Tskhay and Rule (2015) found that cues to affect distinguished gay and straight men's appearance. Specifically, people stereotype gay men as happy and straight men as angry, paralleling communal and agentic traits, respectively. These affective expressions influenced perceptions of sexual orientation independent of features related to masculinity/femininity (that sometimes overlap; see Hess, Adams, & Kleck, 2005). Thus, affective expressions might cue sexual orientation over and above masculinity/femininity.

Several characteristics perceived from faces may therefore contribute to differences in perceptions of sexual orientation and could also affect perceptions of whether gay and straight men ""fit"" some occupations versus others. Thus, given the primacy of the face over more relevant and available diagnostic information (e.g., Blair et al., 2005), we expected that individuals' facial appearance would impact evaluators' perceptions beyond information about their qualifications for a particular job and tested the extent to which perceptions of sexual orientation, masculinity/femininity, and facial affect would mediate such relationships.

#### Ameliorating Employment Discrimination

Although we expected cues to sexual orientation to influence perceptions of gay and straight men's job suitability, a recent meta-analytic review by Koch, D'Mello, and Sackett (2015) found that various factors can mitigate gender-based role congruity effects in the workplace. For instance, studies that manipulated

participants' sense of fairness showed less evidence of bias, though such interventions seemed to apply more to male-dominated jobs than to female-dominated jobs. We therefore reasoned that invoking fairness might similarly ameliorate sexual orientation biases in judgments of job suitability, at least for jobs stereotypically associated with straight men.

#### Current Work

We tested these hypotheses across six studies. In Study 1, participants considered how successful they thought a series of qualified men would be securing a job as either a nurse or engineer. Without mentioning sexual orientation or that the targets differed systematically, we expected that subtle cues to sexual orientation in targets' facial appearances would lead participants to evaluate the gay men as more likely to attain jobs as nurses and the straight men as more likely to attain jobs as engineers. In Study 2, we examined whether perceivers' experience with hiring decisions might affect these judgments by recruiting individuals with professional experience in selection and hiring. Consistent with studies illustrating the pervasiveness of implicit discrimination (e.g., Blair et al., 2004), we expected that individuals with professional hiring experience would not be immune to the biasing influence of sexual orientation from facial appearance. In Studies 3A and 3B, we provided judges with diagnostic information about the candidates' qualifications alongside their faces to test whether this might overcome their face-based biases; though we expected this to have little effect in light of the primacy of facial appearance upon other judgments in past work (e.g., Rule et al., 2014). In Study 4, we did expect to see attenuation of biases based on sexual orientation, however, by instructing participants to consider the fairness of their judgments (see Koch et al., 2015).

We then extended our investigation in Study 5 by asking participants to adopt the role of consumer rather than evaluator. In Study 5A, participants considered how much they would like each target to serve either as the pediatrician (a stereotypically communal medical subspecialty) or surgeon (a stereotypically agentic subspecialty; Lambert & Holmboe, 2005) for themselves or a loved one. In Study 5B, participants evaluated how much they would like each man as their child's English or mathematics (math) teacher, capitalizing on widely subscribed stereotypes of the humanities as feminine and the sciences as masculine (Storer, 1967).

Finally, because previous research has shown that masculinity and affect facilitate accurate perceptions of sexual orientation (Tskhay & Rule, 2015), which may result in discrimination based on sexual orientation (e.g., Pichler et al., 2010), we modeled the differences in job suitability attributed to the gay and straight targets across each of these three domains with masculinity/femininity, facial affect, and perceptions of sexual orientation as mediating variables in Study 6. In other words, we examined whether people's accurate inferences of sexual orientation via perceptions of affect and masculinity would explain differences in the perceived suitability of gay and straight men for jobs as nurses versus engineers, surgeons versus pediatricians, and English versus math teachers. Thus, we aimed to provide a meaningful extension of both the literatures on workplace biases and on the perception of sexual orientation from minimal cues by showing how subtle perceptions of sexual orientation may surreptitiously influence the evaluation of gay and straight men for professional roles.

#### Study 1

To test whether subtle cues to sexual orientation influence perceptions of success across various professions, we used a standardized and previously validated database of gay and straight faces (Rule & Ambady, 2008). The set consisted of 90 pictures of the faces of 18-30 year-old White men downloaded by hypothesis-blind research assistants from online dating websites in major U.S. cities. Men who indicated seeking a samesex partner were considered gay (n = 45), whereas men seeking opposite sex partners were considered straight (n = 45). The research assistants acquiring the photos searched for targets located in distant cities and downloaded the first several photos with faces directed toward the photographer's camera that did not have facial adornments, such as beards, eyeglasses, piercings, or jewelry. Because the websites organized the profiles based on the users' activity (most recent users listed first), the order of profiles was effectively random. Upon acquisition, the research assistants removed the faces from their original backgrounds, grayscaled them, cropped them to the extremes of the head, and standardized them in size. Previous testing showed no differences in the levels of facial attractiveness between the gay and straight men's faces (see Rule et al., 2008). Moreover, although there were no cues from clothing available in the photos, removing other stylistic cues (i.e., hairstyle) from the faces did not obviate the legibility of the targets' sexual orientation in past work (Rule & Ambady, 2008; Rule et al., 2008). Sexual orientation can, therefore, be reliably extracted from these stimuli but is done with sufficient error as to not be obvious (rates of accuracy in past studies have typically ranged between 60 and 70%; see Tskhay & Rule, 2013).

We instructed 68 undergraduate participants that they would view a series of photos of men due to graduate from a local engineering (n = 34) or nursing (n = 34) program at the end of the semester who were currently applying for jobs with engineering firms or hospitals, respectively. We asked them to assess how likely they thought each individual would be to acquire a job within the next 6 months along a scale ranging from 1 (not at all likely) to 7 (very likely) for a total of 90 trials. We did not mention sexual orientation at any point or give any indication that the targets differed according to any systematic groupings.

#### Results

We submitted the data to a 2 (Condition: nursing, engineering) × 2 (Sexual Orientation: gay, straight) analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures on the second factor. The data exhibited no main effects of Condition, F(1, 66) = 1.39, p = . 24, r Effect Size = . 14, or Sexual Orientation, F(1, 66) = 1.00, p = . 32, ""Effect Size = . 12, but did reveal a significant Condition × Sexual Orientation interaction, F(1, 66) = 40.61, p < . 001, reffect Size = .62.2 Bonferroni-corrected (a = . 025) simple effects t-tests decomposing the interaction showed that participants predicted gay men (M = 4.11, SD = 0.51) to be more successful than straight men (M = 3.84, SD = 0.56) in attaining nursing positions, t(33) = 4.15, p < . 001, rEffect size = . 59, but expected straight men (M = 4.34, SD = 0.74) to be more successful than gay men (M = 3.97, SD = 0.78) in attaining positions as engineers, t(33) = 4.84, p < .001, reffect Size = . 64; see Figure 1.

#### Discussion

Without mentioning sexual orientation, individuals perceived gay men as significantly more appropriate candidates for a stereotypically communal professional position (nurse) and perceived straight men as significantly more appropriate candidates for a stereotypically agentic professional position (engineer), fitting our predictions based on the Lack of Fit Model and Role Congruity Theory (Eagly & Karau, 2002; Heilman, 1983). Given that our undergraduate participants likely had limited experience making personnel or hiring decisions (Koch et al., 2015), we sought to extend the ecological validity of the present findings in Study 2 by repeating the study with a sample of working adults with and without experience making employee hiring decisions.

#### Study 2

We recruited 201 working adults (112 men, 89 women; MAge = 37.8 years, SD = 12.5; 187 heterosexual, 14 gay, bisexual, or other) online via Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to follow the same procedure using the same materials and measures as in Study 1.3 Of these, 84 participants had professional experience making hiring decisions (n = 42 in the nursing condition, n = 42 in the engineering condition) whereas the remaining 117 participants did not (n = 54 in the nursing condition, n = 63 in the engineering condition). After rating the faces, the participants additionally completed a short demographic measure in which we asked about their age, gender, sexual orientation, profession, and hiring experience. For the last of these, we first asked the participants to respond ""Yes"" or ""No"" to the question ""Do you have any experience in hiring employees?"" after which those responding ""Yes"" received the prompt, ""How many years of experience do you have in hiring employees?""

#### Results

We submitted the participants' ratings to a 2 (Condition: nursing, engineering) × 2 (Sexual Orientation: gay, straight) × 2 (Hiring Experience: yes, no) ANOVA with repeated measures on the second factor. Only the Condition × Sexual Orientation interaction reached statistical significance, F(1, 197) = 66.52, p < .001, rEffect Size = .50 (all other main and interaction effect Fs ≤ 3.69, ps ≥ .06, and rSEffect Size ≤ . 14). Bonferroni-corrected (α = .025) simple effects within each condition mimicked the pattern

we observed in Study 1: participants perceived gay men (M = 4.43, SD = 0.91) as more likely to secure a nursing job than straight men (M = 4.20, SD = 0.82), t(95) = 4.78, p < .001, rEffect Size = . 44, and perceived straight men (M = 4.53, SD = 0.90) as more likely to secure an engineering job than gay men (M = 4.23, SD = 1.00), t(104) = 6.57, p < . 001, reffect Size = .54. Including participant gender for exploratory purposes did not produce any additional significant effects in a separate model (Fs ≤ 2.36, ps ≥ .13, and rSEffect Size ≤ .12).4

Despite the nonsignificant effects of participants' hiring experience, we sought to explore the relationship between hiring experience and evaluations of the targets further by examining the number of years that the participants reported having had experience making hiring decisions. We therefore conducted a 2 (Condition: nursing, engineering) × 2 (Sexual Orientation: gay, straight) mixed model analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) just among the participants with hiring experience, including their years of experience (M = 5.41 years, SD = 4.90) as a covariate. As above, only the Condition × Sexual Orientation interaction reached statistical significance, F(1, 81) = 42.73, p < . 001, reffect Size = . 59, with the exception of the significant covariate effect of participants' years of hiring experience (i.e., participants with more hiring experience gave higher ratings to targets overall), F(1, 81) = 9.48, p = . 003, VEffect Size = . 32; all other main and interaction effect Fs ≤ 1.09, ps ≥ .30, and rSEffect Size ≤ . 12 (see Table 1 in the Supplemental Materials for correlations). As with the full sample, participants with hiring experience perceived gay men (M = 4.66, SD = 0.94) as significantly more suited for jobs as nurses than straight men (M = 4.14, SD = 1.04), t(41) = 3.96, p < . 001, reffect Size = . 53, and perceived straight men (M = 4.53, SD = 0.89) as significantly more suited for jobs as engineers than gay men (M = 4.40, SD = 0.94), t(41) = 5.36, p < . 001, reffect Size = . 64 (Bonferronicorrected a = . 025).

#### Discussion

Working adults and people with professional experience hiring others showed biases similar to undergraduates in their evaluations of targets' job prospects from photos of their faces. Like the undergraduate participants in Study 1, both working adults without

hiring experience and professionals who hire people as part of their job gave preferable ratings to gay men over straight men for positions as nurses, and to straight men over gay men for positions as engineers. The number of years that participants reported hiring people did not moderate these effects but did seem to increase their willingness to hire candidates in general, suggesting that perhaps those inexperienced with hiring may render harsher assessments. These data help to generalize our findings in Study 1 by showing that they extend beyond a university sample to people with more life and employment experience. However, a related limitation of this paradigm is that the participants in both Studies 1 and 2 evaluated the targets only from their faces. Rarely would one present nothing but a photo as the material for a job application; thus, we wanted to increase the ecological validity of our investigation by considering how diagnostic information about the targets' abilities might compete with facial appearance in Study 3 by providing participants with the targets' grade point averages (GPAs; Study 3A) and professional online resumés (i.e., modified LinkedIn profiles; Study 3B).

#### Study 3A

We randomly assigned 102 working adults recruited from MTurk (44 men, 58 women; MAge = 38.0 years, SD = 12.2; 92 heterosexual, 10 gay, bisexual, or other) to the nursing (n = 50) or engineering (n = 52) evaluation tasks following the same procedures as in Studies 1 and 2 with one difference: Here, we presented each face alongside information about the target's cumulative and major (nursing or engineering, respectively) GPA. We generated unique GPA pairs and assigned each of these to one gay face and one straight face, counterbalancing whether both of the GPAs were relatively low (3.0-3.4) or high (3.5-4.0). We instructed the participants that the maximum possible GPA was 4.0 and tested them on this knowledge at the end of the study to ensure their understanding. Participants also answered questions about their age, gender, sexual orientation, profession, and hiring experience before debriefing.

#### Results

Because we matched the GPA information across the gay and straight faces, we analyzed the data using multilevel models that accounted for these pairs nested within each participant using SPSS (IBM Corp., 2015). To simplify model estimation, we analyzed the nursing and engineering conditions separately.5 Following the recommendations of Enders and Tofighi (2007), we effectcoded and grand-mean-centered the Sexual Orientation (gay, straight) and GPA (high, low) predictor variables and then regressed the participants' evaluations of the targets onto both factors and their interaction as fixed effects with a random intercept,

<sup>4</sup> The small number of sexual minority participants in these studies precluded meaningful tests of the effects of participant sexual orientation, leaving the question of variation according to participant sexual orientation open to future research.

<sup>5</sup> Analyzing the data with condition as an additional predictor in the model did not meaningfully change the results and showed the expected significant Condition × Sexual Orientation interaction here [B = 0.17, SE = 0.05, t(4586) = 3.73, p < . 001, rEffect size = . 05] and in Study 4 [B = 0.11, SE = 0.05, t(4406) = 2.54, p = . 01, TEffect size = . 04].

estimating degrees of freedom with a Satterthwaite approximation (see Table 2 in the Supplemental Materials for simple correlations).6

Nursing condition. Results for participants' evaluations of the targets as nurses revealed a significant main effect of GPA, B = - 1.89, SE = 0.05, t(3567.18) = - - 41.29, p < . 001, rEffect size = - . 57, such that participants evaluated targets as more suited to their intended jobs when presented with higher (M = 5.75, SD = 1.21) versus lower (M = 3.83, SD = 1.40) GPAs, thereby confirming the success of our manipulation (i.e., participants did read, process, and consider the GPA information when making their judgments). More important, we continued to observe the main effect of Sexual Orientation, B = 0.10, SE = 0.03, t(2248) = 3.09, p = . 002, rEffect Size = . 07, in which participants rated the gay men (M = 4.83, SD = 1.60) as more likely to attain jobs as nurses than the straight men (M = 4.76, SD = 1.64). The GPA × Sexual Orientation interaction was not significant, B = - 0.07, SE = 0.05, t(2248) = - 1.48, p = . 14, rEffect Size = - . 03.

The significant main effects of GPA, B = - 1.52, SE = 0.07, t(3595.80) = - 22.77, p < . 001, rEffect Size = - . 35, and Sexual Orientation, B = 0.12, SE = 0.05, t(2246) = 2.53, p = . 01, ""Effect Size = . 05, persisted when we added participant gender to the model for exploratory purposes. Moreover, the GPA × Sexual Orientation interaction was now significant, B = - 0.14, SE = 0.07, t(2246) = - 1.99, p = . 05, rEffect Size = . 04. Analyzing the main effect of Sexual Orientation separately for both the high and low GPAs (Bonferroni-corrected & = . 025) revealed that gay men (M = 5.80, SD = 1.14) were rated as better suited for nursing than straight men (M = 5.70, SD = 1.27) when their GPAs were high, B = 0.10, SE = 0.03, t(1124) = 3.17, p = .002, reffect size = . 09, but that gay men (M = 3.85, SD = 1.39) and straight men (M = 3.82, SD = 1.41) were regarded as similarly (un)suitable for nursing when their GPAs were low, B = 0.03, SE = 0.03, t(1124) = 0.98, p = . 33, ""Effect Size = . 03. Similarly, exploring the effects of participants' hiring experience in a separate model showed a main effect of GPA, B = - 0.76, SE = 0.23, t(3587.05) = - 3.36, p = . 001, ""Effect Size = = - . 06, but not of Sexual Orientation, B = - 0.20, SE = 0.17, t(2246) = - 1.24, p < . 001, reffect size = - . 03, or their interaction, B = 0.27, SE = 0.23, t(2246) = 1.17, p = . 24, reffect size = .02 (see Table 1 for other effects of gender and hiring experience).

Engineering condition. Results of the analyses for the evaluations of targets as engineers showed complementary results. We again observed a main effect of GPA, B = - 2.11, SE = 0.04, t(3672.28) = - 47.82, p < .001, rEffect Size = - . 62, such that the participants evaluated the targets as better candidates for jobs as engineers when presented with high (M = 5.58, SD = 1.42) versus low (M = 3.50, SD = 1.41) GPAs, confirming our manipulation. Critically, we also observed the main effect of Sexual Orientation, B = - 0.07, SE = 0.03, t(2338) = - 2.16, p = . 03, reffect Size = - . 04. As expected, participants evaluated the straight men (M = 4.56, SD = 1.75) as more likely to attain jobs as engineers than the gay men (M = 4.52, SD = 1.77). The GPA × Sexual Orientation interaction was not significant, B = 0.06, SE = 0.04, t(2338) = 1.28, p = .20, rEffect Size = . 03.

Similar to the evaluations of the targets as nurses, adding participant gender to the model continued to show a significant main effect of GPA, B = - 2.17, SE = 0.07, t(3669.35) = - 31.32, p < .001, rEffect Size = -. 46, though the main effect of Sexual Orientation was now only marginally significant, B = - 0.09, SE = 0.05, t(2336) = - 1.86, p = .06, rEffect Size = - . 04. A significant GPA × Sexual Orientation interaction emerged in this model, B = 0.15, SE = 0.07, t(2336) = 2.14, p = . 03, rEffect Size = . 04. Similar to the nursing condition, decomposing the interaction showed that the gay and straight targets did not differ when presented with low GPAs (Mcay = 3.50, SD = 1.42; Mstraight = 3.51, SD = 1.40), B = - 0.01, SE = 0.03, t(1170) = - 0.36, p = . 72, ""Effect Size = -. 01. Moreover, although the straight targets (M = 5.55, SD = 1.46) garnered higher scores than the gay targets (M = 5.61, SD = 1.38) when presented with high GPAs, the difference did not survive correction for multiple comparisons (Bonferroni-corrected a = . 025), B = - 0.07, SE = 0.03, t(1168) = - 2.14, p = . 03, rEffect Size = . 06. Accounting for participants' hiring experience almost fully ablated the main effect of Sexual Orientation, B = - - 0.01, SE = 0.11, t(2336) = - 0.10, p = . 92, Irleffect Size < . 01, and the GPA × Sexual Orientation interaction, B = 0.15, SE = 0.16, t(2336) = 0.97, p = .33, rEffect Size = .02, though the main effect of GPA remained statistically significant, B = - 1.89, SE = 0.16, t(3671.93) = - 11.92, p < . 001, reffect size = - . 19 (see Table l).

#### Discussion

Even when presented with objective information relevant for assessing individuals' ability to perform effectively in their field of choice, participants continued to use information about sexual orientation derived from men's faces to evaluate them, though much less than they did the GPA information and with effect sizes notably smaller than those observed among participants only judging the face in Studies 1 and 2. This is not because participants simply ignored the quantitative information about GPA; rather, targets' purported GPAs significantly affected the participants' judgments throughout our analyses. When accounting for participants' hiring experience, however, only the objective GPA information predicted target evaluations. Moreover, differences based on target sexual orientation did not manifest when their ostensible GPAs were low, suggesting that the participants saw them as relatively equally unqualified for either nursing or engineering positions.

The observation that targets' apparent sexual orientation did not influence evaluations of their job suitability when weakly qualified resembles Dovidio and Gaertner's (2000) findings on aversive racism, which showed that anti-Black discrimination emerged in simulated employment decisions only for ambiguously qualified targets. Targets with obviously weak or strong qualifications theoretically compel one to rely on the clear objective information. Thus, here, participants may have simply discounted the targets with the relatively low GPAs because they appeared unqualified within the context of those whose GPAs were higher, expressing their biases only when differentiating between the relatively wellqualified candidates. We explored this possibility further in Study 3B by presenting participants with a new set of targets with a

greater amount of information about professional credentials whose multivariate character increased the ambiguity of the targets' qualifications and enhanced the ecological validity of the judgments.

#### Study 3B

The results of Study 3A notwithstanding, people rarely evaluate job candidates by simply examining their photo alongside their GPA. Exchanging some experimental control for greater ecological validity, we attempted to better approximate real hiring contexts by presenting perceivers with the profiles and photos of actual working professionals from LinkedIn, the online professional network service. Although users do not explicitly indicate their sexual orientation on LinkedIn, we assumed that sexual minorities would be more likely to participate in lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) organizations than straight people would. Therefore, we identified the profiles of 43 male members of one of three not-for-profit organizations focused on fostering connections among LGBT professionals and henceforth refer to these targets as ""gay."" Using LinkedIn's Similar People function, we then found the profiles of 43 men whose backgrounds, work experience, and qualifications matched those of the gay men but who did not report affiliating with an LGBT organization; we henceforth refer to these targets as ""straight."" Of these individuals, we excluded several who either posed looking away from the camera or had an obvious cue to his sexual orientation in his photo's background (e.g., a poster or LGBT event) for a total of 56 target photos (28 gay, 28 straight).

More important, we edited the profiles to exclude information about affiliations so that there would be no obvious cues to sexual orientation within the profile material. Specifically, we abbreviated the profile contents to include only the information about education, two examples of recent work experience, and listed skills, assuring that nothing would indicate the sexual orientation of the profile's original owner. We then created a second version of each profile, in which we swapped the photos of (presumably) gay targets with those of (presumably) straight targets. This re-

sulted in two versions of each profile: one with the photo of a gay man and one with the photo of a straight man, which we counterbalanced across participants so that no participant saw the same profile or photo more than once. Thus, we manipulated sexual orientation by experimentally varying the putative sexual orientation of the photo accompanying the profile so that we could test how sexual orientation affected candidates' hirability when presented with identical credentials.

We recruited 99 working adults from MTurk (62 men, 37 women; MAoc = 33.17 years, SD = 9.96; 89 heterosexual, 10 gay, bisexual or other) to rate the targets' hirability for a managerial position (a stereotypically agentic profession) from 1 (not at all hirable) to 7 (very hirable). To minimize fatigue and maximize engagement with the task, we asked each participant to rate only 25 randomly selected profile-photo combinations in random order. We never mentioned sexual orientation and no participants reported recognizing any of the targets. Participants answered questions about their age, gender, sexual orientation, profession, and hiring experience at the end of the survey.

#### Results

A paired-samples t-test showed that participants rated the straight candidates (M = 4.80, SD = 0.88) as significantly more hirable than the gay candidates (M = 4.65, SD = 0.93) when presented with the same qualifications, t(98) = 2.95, p = . 004, ""Effect Size = . 29. Neither the participants' gender nor hiring experience significantly moderated this difference (Fs ≤ 0.12, ps ≥ .73, rSEffect Size ≤ .04); see Table 3 in the Supplemental Materials for correlations between the variables.

#### Discussion

Participants rated men as more hirable for positions as managers when their profile photo subtly conveyed that they might be straight versus gay, despite identical credentials. Although assuming the targets' sexual orientations based on their self-reported professional affiliations somewhat limits these findings, these more naturalistic stimuli (i.e., actual LinkedIn users' profiles and full-color face-and-torso photos) nevertheless produced results that dovetailed with those obtained under the more controlled conditions reported above. This convergence between studies with high experimental control and high ecological validity provides a more complete picture of how sexual orientation may constrain or facilitate one's job prospects.

Consistent with past work showing the influence of facial appearance on life outcomes (e.g., Blair et al., 2004, 2005), participants in Studies 3A and 3B seemed unable to fully ignore their subjective impressions based on the targets' faces. Interestingly, we observed a larger effect of target sexual orientation here than in Study 3A, despite the provision of greater (and arguably more relevant) information. Such differences parallel those found by Dovidio and Gaertner (2000) in their study of aversive racism. In their work, participants' biases only became apparent when the targets' qualifications for a given position were ambiguous. Here, the relatively subjective and multivariate nature of the profiles presents ambiguity similar to that of basing one's judgment just upon the face (as in Studies 1 and 2), thus allowing participants to express (even if only nonconsciously) their preferences guided by the target's sexual orientation-the ambiguity of which permits rationalization of the decision.

This concerning bias based on facial appearance could contribute to sexual orientation discrimination in employment contexts. Past studies examining other forms of workplace discrimination, such as sexism, have found that invoking perceivers' sense of fairness can ameliorate such biases. To ascertain whether such a strategy might also mitigate the bias that we have observed thus far in the present research, we adopted a fairness intervention in Study 4 by asking participants to make their judgments objectively. Given that Koch et al. (2015) found that careful decision-making (as through highlighting fairness) only ameliorated gender biases for male-dominated jobs, we expected that this manipulation might only affect participants' evaluations of gay and straight men as engineers (a male-dominated profession) but perhaps not as nurses (a female-dominated profession).

#### Study 4

We randomly assigned 100 working adults from MTurk (36 men, 64 women; MAge = 36.2 years, SD = 12.0; 85 heterosexual, 15 gay, bisexual, or other) to complete the same nursing (n = 50) and engineering (n = 50) evaluation tasks from Study 3A. Rather than instructing participants to base their ratings of the targets on their first impressions, however, we instead told them to make their decisions as fair and objective as possible (see Appendix 1 in the Supplemental Materials for exact instructions). Two participants in the nursing condition failed the comprehension-check question about the maximum possible GPA and so we excluded them from analysis. We again analyzed the data using multilevel models with the same parameters as in Study 3A to assess the effects of the targets' sexual orientation and ostensible GPA on participants' ratings of their likely success as a nurse or engineer (respective to condition; see Table 4 in the Supplemental Materials for simple correlations).

#### Results

Nursing condition. Similar to Study 3A, we again observed main effects of GPA, B = - 1.99, SE = 0.05, t(3467.20) = - 42.63, p < . 001, VEffect Size = -. 59, and Sexual Orientation, B = 0.12, SE = 0.03, t(2158) = 3.46, p = . 001, reffect Size = . 07. Confirming our manipulation, participants evaluated targets presented with high GPAs (M = 5.63, SD = 1.27) as more likely to get jobs as nurses than targets presented with low GPAs (M = 3.60, SD = 1.41). More critical, despite instruction to make their decisions fairly, participants continued to evaluate gay targets (M = 4.65, SD = 1.67) as better suited for positions as nurses than straight targets (M = 4.58, SD = 1.70). GPA and Sexual Orientation did not significantly interact, B = - 0.07, SE = 0.05, t(2158) = - 1.52, p = . 13, VEffect Size = - . 03. Adding neither participants' gender nor hiring experience perturbed this pattern of results (see Table 2).

Engineering condition. In distinction, participants instructed to consider the fairness of their decisions did not evaluate the gay (M = 4.78, SD = 1.58) and straight (M = 4.79, SD = 1.60) targets

No other main effects or interactions, including participants' gender or hiring experience, yielded significant effects (Itls ≤ 1.96, ps ≥.05, lrl SEffect Size ≤ . 04).

#### Discussion

Instructing participants to provide fair and objective assessments of job candidates partly eliminated biases based on sexual orientation. Participants evaluating gay and straight men for positions as engineers showed no significant advantage in favor of straight men over gay men, as they had in Studies 1-3A. Participants evaluating the men for positions as nurses, however, continued to give more favorable ratings to gay men than to straight men. This asymmetry accords with past research on the effects of decision-making interventions in reducing gender-based role congruity biases (see Koch et al., 2015). Specifically, asking participants to make fair and unbiased judgments mitigated differences in evaluations between men and women in past work, and may have helped to reduce differences between gay and straight men in the current study for male-dominated jobs. Despite giving more positive ratings to targets with higher GPAs, participants in the nursing condition continued to show an influence of the targets' facial appearance in their judgments here and in Study 3A. Overt performance-diagnostic information about the targets' abilities (i.e., their GPAs) therefore did not eliminate group-based favoritism whereas instructing participants to make their judgments fairly did seem to have some mitigating effect. We combined both the GPA and fairness manipulations in the current study, however, obscuring whether the fairness manipulation accounted for participants' more equitable decisions itself (in contrast to the results of Study 3A, which showed similar effect sizes in the nursing condition but changed noticeably in the engineering condition) or if the reduction in bias occurred because of the combination of the GPA and fairness manipulations; disentangling this potential confound would require further testing.

Nevertheless, people not only seem to read sexual orientation from the face without provocation (e.g., Rule, Macrae, & Ambady, 2009) but also appear to use this information in a way that influences individuals' opportunities and outcomes. Although rather small, the pattern of effect sizes that we observed continued to support the aversive bigotry account outlined above, suggesting that the diagnostic nature of the objective GPA information forestalled the ambiguity needed for individuals to judge the targets without challenging their presumed sense of equity. Notably, accounting for participants' hiring experience annulled the main effect of sexual orientation in Study 3A but not here or in Study 2. Thus, neither participants' gender nor hiring experience seems to reliably alter perceptions of job suitability based on sexual orientation.

So far, we have only examined job suitability differences based on sexual orientation in a few distinct professional categories. To determine whether these discrepancies might also emerge in other domains, we examined how perceptions of the occupational fit of gay and straight men might apply to more subtle differences within single fields in Study 5. In addition, rather than ask participants to make external predictions about each individual's success, we asked them to take on the hypothetical role of a consumer soliciting the services of each man as a physician (Study 5A) or teacher (Study 5B).

#### Study 5A

We instructed 127 undergraduate participants that they would see a series of faces of individuals who would soon graduate from local medical schools and were applying for residency training as either a pediatrician (a subdiscipline of medicine characterized by more communal traits, n = 69) or as a surgeon (a subdiscipline of medicine characterized by more agentic traits, n = 58; Feldman-Summers & Kiesler, 1974).7 We asked the participants to rate how much they would want each target to be the pediatrician (surgeon) for someone they cared about on a scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very much) based on the photos of gay and straight men used in Study 1 (90 trials total).

#### Results

The results of a 2 (Condition: pediatrician, surgeon) × 2 (Sexual Orientation: gay, straight) ANOVA with repeated measures on the second factor revealed no main effect of Condition, F(1, 125) = 1.25, p = . 27, reffect Size = . 10, but a significant main effect of Sexual Orientation, F(1, 125) = 56.01, p < . 001, VEffect Size = . 56, and a significant Condition × Sexual Orientation interaction, F(1, 125) = 8.08, p = . 005, rEffect Size = . 25. Bonferroni-corrected decomposition of these effects (α = .025) showed that participants rated gay men as less desirable than straight men both as surgeons (Mcav = 3.42, SD = 0.94; Mstraight = 3.81, SD = 0.91), t(57) = 6.30, p < . 001, reffect size = . 64, and as pediatricians (MCay = 3.69, SD = 0.89; Mstraight = 3.87, SD = 0.82), t(68) = 3.83, p < .001, rEffect Size = .42, though the effect was greater for the former than for the latter (see Figure 2).

#### Discussion

Despite the stereotypical associations corresponding to pediatricians and surgeons as relatively communal and agentic, respectively, participants who imagined commissioning the services of men as physicians showed a general bias in favor of straight men (or against gay men). Although we did not mention sexual orientation at any point, perceptions of the targets' faces led the participants to prefer straight men over gay men both as pediatricians and surgeons. This may be unsurprising, given that medicine remains a heavily male-dominated profession overall, and as individuals might hold specific biases against the idea of a gay man interacting intimately with children as a pediatrician (Fikar, 1992; Lautenberger, Dandar, Raezer, & Sloane, 2014). However, the stereotypicality of the two medical subspecialties did attenuate this difference: Participants preferred straight men over gay men as surgeons (the agentic subspecialty) to a significantly larger extent than they did as pediatricians (the communal subspecialty) with an effect size similar to that found for the exclusively face-based

<sup>7</sup> We excluded one additional participant in the surgeon condition who provided uniform ratings at the scale midpoint for all of the targets.

judgments in Studies 1 and 2, again suggesting that the ambiguity of the information available might have exacerbated the observed sexual orientation differences in a manner consistent with aversive bigotry. Thus, although the ultimate outcome favors straight men in medicine, these data still show evidence of role congruity effects.

### Study 5B

In Study 5B, we wanted to also examine how men's sexual orientation might influence their professional success within a single professional domain that may be less male-dominated than medicine. Thus, we asked participants to imagine themselves in the position of a consumer in an occupation with more common and pronounced stereotypes: schoolteachers. Using the same stimuli as in Study 1, 93 undergraduate participants rated how likely they would be to choose each target as their child's English (n = 49) or math (n = 44) teacher along a scale ranging from 1 (not at all likely) to 7 (very likely) across 90 trials. Given that stereotypes about the humanities versus sciences tend to characterize the former as more feminine than the latter, we expected that participants might perceive gay men as more appropriate English teachers and straight men as more appropriate math teachers, consistent with predictions based on Role Congruity Theory (Eagly & Karau, 2002) and the Lack of Fit Model (Heilman, 1983).

#### Results

The results of a 2 (Condition: English teacher, math teacher) X 2 (Sexual Orientation: gay, straight) ANOVA with repeated measures on the second factor showed that neither Condition, F(1, 91) = 0.03, p = .86, rEffect Size = . 02, nor Sexual Orientation, F(1, 91) = 1.37, p = . 25, reffect Size = . 12, significantly predicted school teacher desirability. The Condition × Sexual Orientation interaction did reach significance, however, F(1, 91) = 15.49, p < .001, reffect Size = . 38. Bonferroni-corrected (a = . 025) simple effects t-tests within each condition showed that participants rated the gay men (M = 3.79, SD = 0.77) as more desirable English teachers than the straight men (M = 3.66, SD = 0.76), t(48) = 2.33, p = . 02, rEffect Size = . 31, and rated the straight men (M = 3.88, SD = 0.69) as more desirable math teachers than the gay men

(M = 3.63, SD = 0.71), t(43) = 3.10, p = . 003, reffect Size = . 43; see Figure 3.

### Discussion

These differences accord with stereotypes about the humanities as a relatively feminine field and science/math as a relatively masculine field (e.g., Storer, 1967), providing further evidence for role congruity and lack-of-fit effects in evaluations of gay and straight men's job suitability. The data, therefore, suggest that cues to sexual orientation in an individual's face could affect perceptions of his appropriateness for a professional position as a math or English teacher. The effect sizes again suggested that participants might show greater sexual orientation biases when judging targets based on ambiguous information (i.e., just faces), as one might expect in instances of aversive bigotry (see Dovidio & Gaertner, 2000). Yet, although previous studies have suggested that perceivers automatically perceive sexual orientation from faces outside of conscious awareness (e.g., Rule et al., 2007; Rule, Macrae, & Ambady, 2009), we wished to explicitly test our assumption that cues to sexual orientation account for the differences in evaluations that we have observed in this research. We, therefore, tested the contributions of perceived sexual orientation and two of its known correlates (masculinity/femininity and facial affect) as mediators of the relationship between actual sexual orientation and perceived occupational suitability by reanalyzing the data from Studies 1, 2, 5A, and 5B in Study 6.8

### Study 6

To better understand the factors involved in individuals' naïve but distinct evaluations of gay and straight men, we recruited 93 MTurk workers (50 men, 43 women; MAge = 38.2 years, SD = 13.0; 87 heterosexual, 6 gay, bisexual, or other) to rate all 90 faces employed in the studies reported above. Approximately one-third (n = 33) rated the targets' likely sexual orientation from 1 (definitely gay) to 7 (definitely straight), about one-third (n = 30) rated their masculinity/femininity from 1 (masculine) to 7 (feminine), and the remaining one-third (n = 30) rated their positive affect from 1 (not at all happy) to 7 (very happy); none of the ratings differed according to the participants' gender (Itls ≤ 1.19, ps ≥ .24, IrlSeffect size ≤ .21).9 Choosing a more conservative design in which separate groups of perceivers provided judgments of the targets allowed us to model both the targets and perceivers as random in our models, supporting greater generalization to other possible perceivers and targets (see Antonakis, Fenley, & Liechti, 2011; Rosenthal & Rosnow, 2008) and avoiding potential biases because of common method variance (see Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, & Podsakoff, 2003). We did not manipulate or mention jobs to the participants.

<sup>8</sup> Notably, we did not reanalyze the data from Study 3B because they only included one profession nor those from Studies 3A and 4 because of the additional variables and manipulations in those studies.

<sup>9</sup> We actually collected the affect ratings from a separate sample at a later point in time.

We aggregated the ratings across participants for every target such that each had a mean score for perceived sexual orientation (interrater agreement ICC = .87), a mean score for masculinity/femininity (interrater agreement ICC = .86), and a mean score for affect (interrater agreement ICC = . 97). Because we sought to examine the degree to which participants preferred any given candidate for one type of job versus another, we used the mean (consensus) scores for each of the judgments in the three domains to calculate difference scores with the targets serving as the unit of analysis.10 Specifically, we subtracted the mean score given to each target for his suitability as a nurse from that for his suitability as an engineer using the aggregated data from Studies 1 and 2, subtracted the mean score for each target's desirability as one's pediatrician from the mean score for his desirability as one's surgeon using the data from Study 5A, and subtracted the mean score for each target's desirability as one's child's English teacher from the mean score for his desirability as one's child's math teacher using the data from Study 5B.11 These three difference scores served as the dependent variables in the three respective models described below and represented a consensually agreed preference for the candidate in the more stereotypically agentic versus communal profession.

Data modeling. We analyzed the data using path analysis (see Table 5 in the Supplemental Materials for bivariate correlations). We hypothesized that actual sexual orientation would predict the differences in preference for the candidates as a function of perceptions of sexual orientation, masculinity, and affect. Thus, we specified three serial multiple mediation models in which actual sexual orientation predicted perceptions of sexual orientation, masculinity, and affect; masculinity and affect also predicted perceptions of sexual orientation; and all three predicted ratings of the candidates as engineers versus nurses, as surgeons versus pediatricians, and as math versus English teachers, respectively. Given that previous research has suggested that both masculinity and affect simultaneously and independently predict accurate perceptions of male sexual orientation (Tskhay & Rule, 2015), and that perceptions of sexual orientation affect gay men's life outcomes (Pichler et al., 2010),

those models allowed us to test whether people's accurate inferences of sexual orientation via masculinity and affect would result in job suitability biases based on sexual orientation. Accordingly, we specified all direct effects between the variables and the covariance between perceptions of masculinity and affect, evaluating the significance of the indirect effects using the product of coefficients method (Preacher & Hayes, 2008) by drawing 5,000 bootstrapped resamples and examining whether the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) included 0 to evaluate statistical significance at a = . 05 (see Figures 4-6 for graphical representations of the models with parameter estimates).

Model parameters. The total effects showed that actual sexual orientation predicted differences in job suitability in all three models (see Table 3). Consistent with the findings reported above, the direct effect from actual sexual orientation to the engineer-nurse and math-English teacher difference scores was significant, whereas the direct effect between actual sexual orientation and the surgeon-pediatrician difference scores was not

More important, perceived sexual orientation mediated the relationship between actual orientation and both the engineer-nurse and math-English teacher difference scores independent of the other variables. Additionally, affect mediated the relationship between actual sexual orientation and the engineer-nurse, surgeon-pediatrician, and math-English teacher difference scores. Masculinity/femininity did not emerge as a significant mediator, nor were any of the combined effects of the three mediators statistically reliable (as reflected in the nonsignificant serial mediation effects).

### Discussion

These results collectively show that participants' discrepant judgments of gay and straight targets for the three sets of professions arose because of general perceptions of their sexual orientation and evaluations of their positive affect. Masculinity/ femininity, however, showed no significant influence on job suitability ratings. Previous research has shown that both affect and masculinity/femininity uniquely contribute to explaining the relationship between actual and perceived sexual orientation (Tskhay & Rule, 2015) and that affect is entwined with perceptions of sex and gender (e.g., Hess et al., 2005). More important, although perceptions of positive affect explained the discrepancies in ratings given to the gay and straight targets for all three sets of professions here, it influenced these differences independent of its relationship to perceived sexual orientation and masculinity/femininity. Thus, people do not appear to simply regard men displaying greater levels of positive affect as better equipped to work as nurses, pediatricians, and math teachers. Rather, affect contributes to these differences without

fully accounting for the additional influence of gestalt assessments of targets' sexual orientation.

Despite not predicting job-rating differences, masculinity/femininity did mediate the relationship between actual and perceived sexual orientation, consistent with previous research (e.g., Rieger et al., 2010). The important influence of gender atypicality on perceptions of sexual orientation notwithstanding, previous research has similarly found that masculinity/femininity is not isomorphic with perceptions of sexual orientation (e.g., Freeman et al., 2010; Tskhay & Rule, 2015). Likewise, other cues beyond masculinity/femininity relevant to sexual orientation and facial cues may impact differences in the perceived job suitability of gay and straight men. Specifically, perceptions of affect and global

inferences of sexual orientation predicted differences between gay and straight targets' perceived suitability better than masculinity/ femininity did across all three sets of professions. Notably, we solicited masculinity/femininity ratings because of their direct relationships with perceptions of sexual orientation (e.g., Rieger et al., 2010) and with agency/communality. However, just as there is unshared variance between masculinity/femininity and sexual orientation, agency/communion may not perfectly correlate with masculinity/femininity, either. Thus, perhaps our results are limited by not using more relevant terms.

Although these findings do not directly support our original hypothesis that the agency/communality of particular jobs would explain why gay and straight men were deemed less suitable for

them, this does not obviate the applicability of Role Congruity Theory (Eagly & Karau, 2002) nor its progenitor, the Lack of Fit Model (Heilman, 1983), to understanding the differences that we observed. Whereas those conceptualizations have centered primarily on the way that gender roles (principally, masculinity/femininity) influence workplace outcomes, the present data suggest that unique roles for other stereotypical characteristics related to sexual orientation may exist as well. These data might therefore help to broaden the theoretical impact of that work by extending it to other social dimensions apart from gender and its immediate correlates, as a growing body of research has done for perceptions of race (e.g., Sy et al., 2010) but none, to our knowledge, has yet done for perceptions of sexual orientation.

Moreover, further research might help to decompose perceived sexual orientation into its more basic elements to add tangibility to this result. The lack of significant serial mediation effects suggests that masculinity/femininity and affect did not centrally contribute to the influence that perceived sexual orientation had upon differences in ratings of targets' job suitability. Although other components of perceived sexual orientation may help to resolve its relationship with the job suitability ratings, gestalt judgments of perceived sexual orientation that exceed its constituent parts could also account for these differences. Just as the base elements of what comprises perceptions of sexual orientation are not entirely known, future work may seek to explore which of its undocumented aspects account for differences in gay and straight men's perceived fit for particular jobs.

### General Discussion

Subtle perceptions of sexual orientation based on men's faces may influence the opportunities they have to obtain jobs and succeed in particular professions. Across four domains, gay and straight men's facial appearance seemed to guide how suitable participants deemed them for various occupations. Without mentioning sexual orientation at any point, participants construed gay

men toward stereotypically communal/feminine professions and straight men toward stereotypically agentic/masculine professions, despite ostensibly equal qualifications.

Accordingly, participants anticipated that gay men would more likely succeed in obtaining jobs as nurses when we described both the gay and straight individuals as having recently graduated from a local nursing program. In complement, when we presented the same faces under an identical scenario that substituted engineering for nursing, participants rated the straight men as significantly more likely to succeed in getting hired. This bias persisted across participants with a variety of backgrounds, ranging from undergraduates to employers. Yet, consistent with past work (Koch et al., 2015), appealing to participants' sense of fairness helped to mitigate their biased assessment for male-dominated professions but not femaledominated professions. Thus, these effects appear to be both insidious (possibly relying on implicit processing of the targets' group membership) and robust.

Moreover, perceived sexual orientation also affected individuals' decisions about from whom they would solicit a variety of services. When imagining themselves in the circumstance of needing a physician to treat a loved one, participants preferred straight men over gay men. This applied both when hypothetically seeking either a surgeon (a stereotypically agentic medical subspecialty) or pediatrician (a stereotypically communal medical subspecialty; Feldman-Summers & Kiesler, 1974). Overall, participants preferred physicians that looked particularly heterosexual, though they favored straight men as surgeons significantly more than as pediatricians. Individuals also showed biases about whom they would rather teach their children. When asked to imagine considering upcoming graduates as potential instructors, participants preferred gay men as English teachers and straight men as math teachers-consistent with stereotypes about the humanities as a ""softer"" and more feminine domain of study, and math as a ""harder"" and more masculine field (Storer, 1967).

Various factors mitigated these differences. Supplying participants with directly diagnostic information about the candidates' qualifications by presenting the targets with their ostensible GPAs resulted in heavy reliance upon the GPA scores for judging job suitability. Though the information about sexual orientation available in the face still seemed to exert an effect (171 = . 06, 95% CI [.04, .08]) the effect sizes declined substantially compared to judgments of only the face (17 = .58, 95% CI [.46, .67]). Adding the instruction to make fair decisions reduced sexual orientation differences further for a male-dominated profession (i.e., engineering, IrlEffect size < .01; see also Koch et al., 2015). When evaluating targets in the midst of additional credentials (pared LinkedIn profiles; rEffect size = . 29), however, participants' biases again emerged.

Previous accounts of aversive bigotry might help to explain this superficially ironic effect. For example, Dovidio and Gaertner (2000) observed that individuals displayed racially biased preferences in simulated hiring decisions only when candidates' qualifications were ambiguous, presumably because it allowed for some sense of plausible deniability that race motivated one's decision. When targets possessed obviously weak or strong qualifications (similar to our GPA information), participants based their decisions on the clear criteria. In our studies, the faces provided a consistent ambiguous context, particularly as individuals tend not to believe that they can judge sexual orientation from such limited cues (Rule et al., 2008). The subjective and multivariate information provided by LinkedIn profiles continued to allow much ambiguity, though we still observed an attenuation of the sexual orientation bias. Given the many differences between this study and those showing only faces, additional work should test this effect-size variability further to better account for the potential role of aversive bigotry in the present findings. However, the pattern of effects in the current work deserves consideration.

More important, the masculinity/femininity of the men's faces did not account for the discrepancies we observed, contrary to our initial expectations. Rather, direct perceptions of targets' sexual orientation and positive facial affect explained the differences. Previous work has demonstrated that individuals can reliably infer others' sexual orientation from minimal nonverbal information, albeit less accurately (64.5%, on average; Tskhay & Rule, 2013) than the near-perfect performance for social categorization in some other domains (99.2% for race; Remedios et al., 2011), and that positive affect largely explains this discriminability (Tskhay & Rule, 2015). The considerable error in judging sexual orientation nevertheless generates a wide margin of ambiguity. Consequently, perceivers report little knowledge of their ability to accurately judge sexual orientation (Brambilla, Riva, & Rule, 2013; Rule et al., 2008) and tend to process sexual orientation cues unconsciously (e.g., Rule et al., 2007; Rule, Macrae, & Ambady, 2009). Interestingly, we observed here that holistic perceptions of targets' sexual orientation group membership independently explained biases in their perceived suitability for different jobs. This suggests that perceivers may have nonconsciously evaluated the targets' group membership when rating them. Ascertaining exactly what constitutes these gestalt perceptions of sexual orientation independent of gender atypicality and affect would require additional investigation, however. For instance, more direct assessment of how perceptions of sexual orientation relate to perceptions of agency and communion (higher-order traits also supported by masculinity/femininity) might help to elucidate this and help to explain the differences in the evaluation of gay and straight men for particular professions that we have observed.

Unlike earlier studies showing biases in evaluations of job suitability when sexual orientation is explicit (e.g., Horvath & Ryan, 2003), the present data may suggest that evaluators express biases based on sexual orientation unknowingly (though additional research on implicit processing would need to test this directly). The current research therefore combines the past literature on workplace biases with the literature on the legibility of sexual orientation from minimal cues. Yet, our observation that such workplace biases occur via ambiguous sexual orientation cues may render the whole greater than the sum of its parts, contributing to both literatures in a way that neither might achieve alone. Specifically, demonstrating that subtle markers of sexual orientation could potentially influence hiring behaviors helps to better inform researchers and practitioners as to how minimal cues to sexual orientation may affect hiring and promotion decisions. Complementarily, showing that perceptions of indirect information about group membership can influence applied outcomes in the real world helps to advance the work of researchers in social psychology about the impact of stigma concerning group memberships that are not obvious.

More directly, these data suggest interesting implications for the occupational success of men according to their sexual orientation. In each study, participants considered individuals as forthcoming candidates for particular professions. In Studies 1-4, they expressed the expectation that men would experience different levels of success obtaining professional positions as a function of their sexual orientation. In Study 5, they indicated personal preferences that, in the real world, would directly impact the targets' success in consumer-driven markets. Thus, though limited to controlled experiments, the present data may portend real events that could meaningfully influence individuals' opportunities and success.

For instance, patients' feelings toward their physicians may not only determine their choice of physician, but also affect their ongoing relationships with them (e.g., Zolnierek & DiMatteo, 2009). For example, one study suggested that patients might be more likely to sue their surgeons for malpractice if they do not like the surgeon's vocal tone (Ambady, LaPlante, Nguyen, Rosenthal, Chaumeton, & Levinson, 2002). Given the subjective nature of such judgments (but with serious consequences), we might speculate that implicit perceptions of physicians' sexual orientation could potentially affect physician outcomes, or even the selection of students for medical school and residency (see Fikar, 1992).

Similarly, participants in Study 5B distinguished who they would want teaching their children in math and English according to the candidates' sexual orientation. Given that parents' satisfaction with their children's teachers can influence learning (e.g., Hughes & Kwok, 2007), one might surmise that intuitive impressions like these could impact a teacher's professional success. Indeed, in many cases, schools assign teachers to subject areas based on need, rather than training or personal preference (e.g., Ingersoll, 1999). Thus, if principals displayed similar biases as the participants in our study did, they might unconsciously shunt gay men into teaching English and straight men into teaching math. Such assignment may not correspond with a teacher's actual skills, however, and could therefore affect his apparent professional competence (e.g., a gay man skilled in teaching math may not fare well as an English teacher) by undermining his self-confidence and overall performance (as predicted by the Lack of Fit Model; Heilman, 1983). Though speculative, these possibilities are not insensible. The present work may therefore represent a first step toward understanding how facial cues to sexual orientation might influence individuals' outcomes in ways that could potentially foreclose opportunities for their success in stereotypically incongruent positions.

Our findings may also suggest consequences for professional success that would affect not just individuals but organizations and broader society as well. Previous work has shown that people may direct others toward different professions based on their perceived fit with particular roles (e.g., Heilman, 1983). Indeed, this can occur because of judgments based on facial appearance (Collins & Zebrowitz, 1995). If appearances do not correspond with abilities, however, this might preclude individuals from succeeding in such positions. The cumulative effect of assigning people to jobs based on appearance rather than qualifications could therefore result in organizational inefficiencies that would also affect the customers and end-users of various professional services, as well as the broader function and efficiency of an economic system (locally and nationally). Thus, these data raise important considerations for job outcomes at multiple levels of society worth exploring in further work.

Future researchers might likewise consider how perceptions of sexual orientation may manifest in job interviews. Given the ubiquity of face-to-face interviews for candidate selection (Ryan, McFarland, Baron, & Page, 1999) and the evidence that stigmatized appearances can impact interview outcomes (e.g., Madera & Hebl, 2012), the present findings suggest that an interviewer's intuitive impression of a candidate's sexual orientation might critically influence whether he or she gets hired for a job. Additionally, individuals feeling self-conscious about their sexual orientation in a job interview might perform worse because of the load that such self-monitoring can place on cognition (see Everly, Shih, & Ho, 2012). Moreover, Sylva, Rieger, Linsenmeier, and Bailey (2010) found that people did not effectively conceal their sexual orientation in a mock interview, and Knöfler and Imhof (2007) observed that people altered their nonverbal behavior when interacting with a sexual minority group member, even when they did not explicitly know that their interaction partner differed in sexual orientation. These findings, along with those of Study 3B, suggest that individuals could very well emit cues to their sexual orientation in job interviews to deleterious effect. As the present work can only speculate about this, however, it remains an open question for future research.

Indeed, a key question concerns whether facial appearance might affect employers and customers when selecting job applicants and service providers in the real world rather than in the lab. Accumulating data suggest that they would. Emerging studies across numerous domains have found that facial appearance strongly influences how people evaluate others even when considering much more credible, reasonable, and accessible diagnostic knowledge about them (e.g., Blair et al., 2005). Field studies mirror these effects to a shocking extent: for instance, defendants' facial appearance significantly sways judges and juries even to the point of determining capital execution (Eberhardt et al., 2006; Wilson & Rule, 2015). As illogical and insensible as they may seem, biases based on facial appearance can thus exert very real and extreme outcomes. Ample evidence suggests that the hypothetical decisions studied here would replicate in real life and that appearance-based cues to sexual orientation likely do influence individuals' job success. Nevertheless, direct tests of this remain outstanding.

Moreover, given that we collected many of these data from a politically liberal undergraduate population in a notoriously politically liberal U.S. city (Boston, MA)-especially with regard to gay rights-one might expect stronger effects in more conservative contexts. For example, controversy around gay men as school teachers led to many dismissals in various parts of the United States in recent decades (e.g., Griffin, 1992). Based on these accounts, one might expect people to prefer straight men as teachers over gay men regardless of subject (cf. Study 5B). This remains an interesting direction for future research, particularly as the sociopolitical landscape around dispositions toward sexual minorities has changed sharply in recent years (Pew Research Center, 2013; Smith, 2013).

Likewise, the present research leaves open an account of the conditions within perceivers that might motivate the biases we observed. For instance, do these outcomes result from prejudicial attitudes, beliefs about the controllability of homosexuality, or limited familiarity with sexual minorities (e.g., Horvath & Ryan, 2003)? Consideration of these possibilities could benefit future research into mechanisms beyond role congruity and lack-of-fit for better understanding how sexual orientation influences evaluations of job suitability, particularly as factors beyond masculinity/femininity explained the differences that we observed here. Moreover, future work might also consider how information about individuals that challenges stereotypes about their sexual orientation might help to combat or overcome these biases, and to investigate their instantiation among female targets for whom sexual orientation is typically more legible, though still ambiguous (e.g., Lyons, Lynch, Brewer, & Bruno, 2014; Rule, Ambady, & Hallett, 2009; Tabak & Zayas, 2012).

### Conclusion

Men's facial appearance may therefore play some role in their occupational success. In particular, impressions of men's sexual orientation from photos of their faces seem to affect judgments of their expected effectiveness across a variety of professions. Such prejudices could eschew the opportunities afforded to individuals, not only affecting hiring and promotion but also self-selection into roles believed to offer a greater probability of success because of stereotypes, potentially creating a cyclical process. This warrants a closer look at the underlying mechanisms and consequences of stereotype-based workplace discrepancies, particularly given that they may occur even among ambiguous group distinctions like sexual orientation, which perceivers process subtly and without awareness.

Despite the fact that people make decisions for others as often as they make decisions for themselves, little is known about how decisions for others are different from those made for the self. In two experiments, we investigated the effect of social distance (i.e., making decisions for oneself, a friend, or a stranger) on risk preferences in both gain and loss situations. We found that people were more risk averse in gain situations when they made decisions for themselves than for a stranger (Studies 1 and 2), but were equally risk averse for themselves and their friends (Study 2). However, people were more risk seeking in loss situations when they made decisions for themselves than for their friends as well as for a stranger, and were more risk seeking for their friends than for a stranger (Study 2). Furthermore, the effect of social distance on risk preferences was stronger in loss than in gain situations. Mediation analysis indicated that outcome-induced loss aversion was responsible for effects of social distance on risK preferences. These findings demonstrate that social distance influences risk preferences via perceived loss aversion, which sheds new light on self-other differences in decision making.

# INTRODUCTION

Individual decisions are dramatically susceptible to the frame in which decision-making problems are described. The frame in terms of gains and losses has a remarkable influence on individual decision-making: When people make a choice between a risky and a sure option that have equal expected values, they tend to prefer the risky option in the loss frame, whereas they tend to be risk-averse in the gain frame (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979, 1984; Tversky and Kahneman, 1981).

However, risk preference can change for both types of frame. Research has identified several factors in determining such preference, including task type (Kühberger and Tanner, 2010), affect intensity (Zhang et al., 2016), and decision-maker personality traits such as sensation seeking (Benjamin and Robbins, 2007). Does it also make a difference whether decisions are made for socially distant others, socially close others, or for oneself? Specifically, will people be less riskaverse in the gain frame and less risk-seeking in the loss frame when they make decisions for a stranger than for a close friend or for themselves? The effect of social distance on risk preference

is not well understood for either frame type. Therefore, we investigated how decisions for oneself or another person (i.e., social distance) can influence individuals' risk preferences in both gain and loss frames (i.e., decision situations).

# Risk Preferences in Gain and Loss Frames

According to prospect theory, people are risk averse in the gain frame, preferring a sure gain to a speculative gamble, but are risk seeking in the loss frame, tending to choose a risky gamble rather than a sure loss (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979, 1984; Tversky and Kahneman, 1981). For example, when people face a choice between 'a sure gain of \$250' and 'a 25% chance to gain \$1000, they tend to choose the former option. In contrast, when people face a choice between 'a sure loss of \$750' and 'a probability of 75% of losing \$1000, they prefer the latter option.

Recently, a small research stream has documented individuals' risk preferences in the gain and loss frames (Raue et al., 2015; Ziegler and Tunney, 2015; Sun et al., 2016). For example, using social, spatial, and temporal distance to represent psychological distance, Raue et al. (2015) investigated undergraduate students' decisions in psychologically proximal conditions (e.g., imaging being a student, a new flu virus is currently threatening your city) and in psychologically distal conditions (e.g., imaging being a consultant in health care, some countries in the coming months will be threatened by an unusual disease) in both gain (a sure number of people will be saved and a probability that a larger number of people will be saved) and loss frames (a sure number of people will die and a probability that a larger number of people will die). They found that participants were more risk averse in the gain frame when decisions were made in psychologically proximal than in more distal conditions; however, participants were equally risk seeking in the loss frame. Similarly, Sun et al. (2016) asked the participants to make choices for themselves or for another person (an average student on their campus) during a poker game where participants could end this game to gain (or lose) a sure amount of money, or could continue to play leading to a probability of a larger gain (or loss). They showed that participants were more risk averse in the gain frame when decisions were made for themselves than for others, whereas no significant difference was observed between the two conditions in the loss frame.

### Loss Aversion and Risk Preferences

Loss aversion reflects a prevalent avoidance behavior involving choices that could result in losses (De Martino et al., 2010). Loss aversion demonstrates the fact that people are more sensitive to losses than to gains of the same magnitude. Losses are weighted roughly twice as strongly as gains (Tversky and Kahneman, 1992). For example, people typically avoid a gamble with an equal probability of either gaining \$30 or losing \$20, unless the amount of gain is roughly twice the amount of loss, that is, a 50% possibility of gaining \$40 or losing \$20.

Loss aversion has been used to account for framing effects on risk preference. Specifically, people are more afraid of the potential losses derived from a risky prospect in the gain frame, which contributes to the prevalence of risk aversion in choices between probable and sure gains. On the other hand, people are also more aversive to certain losses derived from a sure (riskless) prospect in the loss frame, which contributes to the prevalence of risk seeking in choices between probable and sure losses (Tversky and Kahneman, 1981, 1992). Some research also provides evidence in favor of the notion that risk preferences in both frames may be driven by loss aversion (Barkley-Levenson et al., 2013; Yechiam and Telpaz, 2013; Rieger et al., 2015). For example, Barkley-Levenson et al. (2013) demonstrated that participants tend to be risk-avoidant due to loss aversion when facing potential gains. Yechiam and Telpaz (2013) showed that participants tend to be more risk-seeking when the decision-making tasks involved potential losses, and they believed that this could be due to people paying more attention to losses.

Therefore, a sure option is preferred to a risky option in a gain frame and a risky alternative is preferred in a loss frame if people feel a strong sense of loss aversion (Ert and Erev, 2013). The stronger the level of loss aversion induced by a risky prospect in the gain frame and by a sure prospect in the loss frame, the more risk averse over gains and more risk seeking over losses people are.

# Social Distance and Loss Aversion

In daily life, individuals make decisions not only for themselves but also for others (Polman, 2010, 2012a; Stone et al., 2013). Furthermore, decisions for others depend heavily on the social distance between ourselves and others (Trope and Liberman, 2010; Sun et al., 2016). Social distance describes the affective closeness between others and ourselves, with a reference point of the self and a target being more psychologically removed from that point as social distance increases (for a review, see Trope and Liberman, 2010).

Previous studies have demonstrated that increased social distance works to reduce loss aversion. For example, Polman (2012b) investigated the impact of making decisions for the self and others on loss aversion across a range of varied contexts, involving exchanging gift cards (Study 1), playing coin-toss gambles (Study 2), playing or rejecting some lotteries (Study 3), and paying to improve or worsen social aspects of life (Studies 4a-e). They showed that loss aversion was markedly reduced when making decisions for others. Similarly, Mengarelli et al. (2014) explored participants' choices for themselves and others across three economic tasks: Choosing between a sure option and a risky option of equal expected value (in task 1), pinpointing the minimum amount of gain accepted to play a gamble with a 50/50 chance to either gain or lose (in task 2), and choosing between two mixed gambles with a 50% chance to either gain or lose (in task 3). They found that loss aversion was remarkably mitigated when making decisions for others as compared with for the self. Additionally, using a virtual lab approach, Andersson et al. (2014) asked participants to make choices in four conditions (decisions for self with/without payment, both the decision maker and the receiver are paid, and decisions for others) that differed by whether they include the possibility of incurring losses. They also showed that decisions for others reduce loss aversion.

In sum, social distance between decision makers and targets influences loss aversion during the decision-making process (Polman, 2012b; Andersson et al., 2014). Decision makers show less loss aversion as social distance increases (i.e., from themselves to a stranger).

### Present Research

Few studies have investigated the effect of social distance on risk preferences in both gain and loss situations. Furthermore, the three existing studies (Raue et al., 2015; Ziegler and Tunney, 2015; Sun et al., 2016) used an imaginary or abstract target to indicate others. For example, Sun et al. (2016) used the designation 'an average student on their campus' to represent the ""other."" However, when a decision is made for an abstract ""other,"" individuals would be emotionally more distant from the ""other,"" which leads to more difficulty imagining how the ""other"" feels about risk (Hsee and Weber, 1997). In addition, people often make decisions on behalf of concrete others rather than imaginary or abstract others in the real world.

Therefore, using a concrete target to indicate others, the present research investigated the influence of social distance on risk preferences in both gain and loss situations. Based on previous findings, we predicted that social distance will have an effect on risk preferences in both gain and loss situations via loss aversion. Specifically, we hypothesized that people may be more risk averse in the gain situation when making decisions for proximal targets than distal targets, but would be more risk seeking in the loss situation when making decisions for proximal targets compared to distal targets.

We conducted two studies to test our hypothesis. In Study 1, we manipulated social distance by asking the participants to make decisions for themselves and for a stranger. In Study 2, we manipulated social distance by asking the participants to make decisions for themselves, a close friend, and a stranger. We also explored whether loss aversion might mediate the relationship between social distance and decisions made for the three types of target.

# STUDY 1

# Methods

#### Participants and Design

Sixty-one undergraduate students participated in Study 1. Data from three participants were excluded from the analyses because they doubted that the decisions for the other person were real on the post-experiment self-report questionnaire. In addition, data from one participant were also excluded from the analyses due to excessive risk seeking. This participant chose only risky options for all trials in two of the four conditions (self-gain, self-loss, other-gain, and other-loss). We therefore used the data from the remaining 57 participants (31 females, age range 18 to 26 years, mean ± SD = 21.72 ± 2.56 years). This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of East China Normal University, and the written informed consent was obtained from all participants involved in the study.

A 2 (social distance: self or other) × 2 (decision situation: gain or loss) within-subjects design was conducted in study 1.

#### Experimental Task and Procedure

We adopted a modified version of the cups task (Weller et al., 2007), which consists of gain and loss domains. Gain domain trials involved the choice between a sure gain of ¥5 (RMB 5) and a designated probability (0.20, 0.25, 0.33, or 0.50) of a larger gain (¥25, ¥20, ¥15, or ¥10) or no gain. Loss domain trials involved the choice between an option that provides a sure loss of ¥5, and another option that provides a designated probability of a larger loss (¥25, ¥20, ¥15, or ¥10) or no loss. In the present study, we only used certain combinations where the levels of probability and magnitude produce equal expected value for the risky and sure options, which offer an ideal measurement of individuals' risk preferences (Xue et al., 2009). These are the following combinations: 0.20 × 25, 0.25 × 20, 0.33 × 15, and 0.50 × 10, for both gain and loss domain trials.

In each trial, a cup was presented on one side of a screen. This side was identified as the sure side where ¥5 was gained (gain domain, Figure 1A) or lost (loss domain, Figure 1B). The other side of the screen was identified as the risky side where an array of two, three, four, or five cups was presented, and the choice of one cup leads to a specified amount of money being gained or lost, whereas selection of the other cups leads to no gain or no loss. For a risky option, whether the choice of one cup caused a non-zero outcome was determined by a random process where p is equal to 1 divided by the number of cups [p = 1/(number of cups); Levin et al., 2007; Weller et al., 2007]. As in the previous study (Xue et al., 2009), participants were not required to select a specific cup in the risky option, and they were only required to choose between a risky option and a sure option, which makes the task easier to perform.

To minimize potential effects of gender on decision propensities under risk, a neutral name (""ZhengLi""; in Chinese, both males and females can have this name) was adopted to indicate the stranger. This name was chosen based on a pilot study conducted on 25 additional participants (13 females, age range 22 to 27 years, mean ± SD = 24.32 ± 1.41 years). Participants were informed that the same-sex stranger had been randomly selected from among the participants of another experiment, and that they would never meet.

The formal experiment consisted of four blocks (two blocks for each decision target). Presentation order of these blocks was counterbalanced across participants. At the beginning of each block, an instruction indicating whether it was a self (decisionfor-self) or stranger (decision-for-stranger) block was shown to the participants for 5000 ms (Figure 1C). Each trial started with the presentation of a central fixation point with a duration that varied randomly from 600 to 1000 ms. Subsequently, a risky and sure option were simultaneously presented on the screen, and participants were instructed to press the number key ""3"" with their right index finger when they choose the option displayed on the left part of the screen, or to press the number key ""4"" with their right middle finger when they choose the option displayed on the right part of the screen. Two (risky and sure) options were randomly positioned to the left or right of the screen in every trial.

The alternatives remained on the screen until the participants made a choice. After the participants' response, the trial ended with a blank screen whose presentation duration ranged from 800 to 1200 ms. Notably, the outcome of the choice was not revealed to the participants in each trial, to exclude potential effects of learning from reward feedback (Suzuki et al., 2016). Within each block, 40 trials were presented in a pseudo-random order in which no more than three successive trials were from the same decision situation, consisting of five repetitions for each of the eight combinations (four combinations for each of gain and loss). In total, each participant performed 160 trials.

Participants were given a ¥30 (about United States \$4.50) initial endowment before the experiment began so that they could pay any eventual losses at the end of the experiment. They were informed that the computer would randomly select one trial from the self trials at the end of the experiment, and the outcome of the selected trial would be added to or subtracted from the initial endowment, and a payment would be implemented depending on their actual choice. Because participants did not know which trial would be selected, they should have treated every trial independently (De Martino et al., 2010). In addition, participants received a show-up fee of ¥20 (about United States \$3).

Before the formal experiment, each participant performed eight practice trials to familiarize themselves with the experimental task. After the experimental task, participants answered a yes/no question: ""Do you strongly doubt that the decisions for the stranger during the task were real ?"" (used for the exclusion of participants; see Method, Participants and design).

### Results and Discussion

A 2 (social distance: self, other) × 2 (decision situation: gain, loss) within- subjects repeated measures ANOVA was conducted on risk rate (i.e., proportion of times that the participants chose the risky option)'. The main effect of social distance was significant, F(1,56) = 6.85, p = 0.011, n2 = 0.11, the risk rate was significantly higher when making decisions for the self (M = 0.53, SD = 0.11) than for others (M = 0.51, SD = 0.11). A significant main effect of decision situation was also observed, F(1,56) = 20.47, p < 0.001, n2 = 0.27. The risk rate in gain situations (M = 0.44, SD = 0.13) was significantly lower than in loss situations (M = 0.59, SD = 0.19).

<sup>1</sup> The data without any participants excluded were also analyzed. In this case, the main effects of social distance and decision situation were less robust, whereas the interaction between social distance and decision situation was enhanced when every participant was included. The simple effects for gain situations were also more robust, whereas these effects were weaker for loss situations. More detailed results with no participants excluded are reported in the Supplementary Materials.

More interestingly, a significant interaction between social distance and decision situation was observed (see Figure 2), F(1,56) = 18.42, p < 0.001, np = 0.25. Follow-up simple effects analyses revealed the following. In gain situations, the risk rate was significantly lower when making decisions for the self (M = 0.42, SD = 0.14) than for others (M = 0.47, SD = 0.15), F(1,56) = 8.94, p = 0.004, n3 = 0.14. However, the risk rate was significantly higher when making decisions for the self (M = 0.64, SD = 0.22) than for others (M = 0.55, SD = 0.18) in loss situations, F(1,56) = 23.45, p < 0.001, n2 = 0.30.

By manipulating social distance, we aimed to investigate the effect of social distance on risk preferences in both gain and loss situations. In line with our hypothesis, people were more risk averse in gain situations when making decisions for themselves than for a stranger, and were more risk seeking in loss situations. Our findings indicated that social distance between decision makers and targets has a significant effect on risk preferences in both gain and loss frames, and moreover, this effect is stronger in loss frames than in gain frames. Yet, in real-world scenarios it is more typical that people make decisions for a close friend as opposed to a complete stranger (Braams et al., 2014; Yu et al., 2015). Furthermore, important decisions are often made for a close friend (Wu et al., 2011). Does it also make a difference whether a decision is made for oneself, a close friend, or a stranger? We next investigated individual risk preferences in both gain and loss situations when making decisions for oneself, a close friend, and a stranger in Study 2.

### STUDY 2

The findings from Study 1 indicated that social distance exerts a strong influence on decision makers' risk preferences in both gain and loss situations. In Study 2, we firstly sought to replicate and extend the findings of Study 1 to provide further evidence for the relationship between social distance and risk preferences. Secondly, we investigated whether the loss aversion induced

![](_page_4_Figure_6.jpeg)

by potential decision outcomes is responsible for the present findings.

#### Methods

#### Participants and Design

Ninety-five undergraduate students participated in Study 2. Data from eleven participants were excluded from the analyses because they doubted that the decisions made for their friends or another person were real on the post-experiment self-report questionnaire. Additionally, data from two participants were also excluded from the analyses because of excessive risk seeking. These two participants chose only risky options for all trials in two of the six conditions (self-gain, self-loss, friend-gain, friend-loss, stranger-gain, and stranger-loss). The remaining eighty-two participants (44 females, age range 18 to 26 years, mean ± SD = 20.77 ± 2.48 years) were used in the data analysis. This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of East China Normal University, and the written informed consent was obtained from all participants involved in the study.

A 3 (social distance: self, friend or stranger) × 2 (decision situation: gain or loss) within-subjects design was conducted in Study 2.

#### Experimental Task and Procedure

Study 2 used the same task as Study 1. Participants were first instructed to write down the name of a same-sex close friend (Leng and Zhou, 2010, 2014; Wu et al., 2011), and this person's telephone and wechat numbers. We assured participants that this information would only be used to make a reward payment. As in Study 1, a neutral name (""ZhengLi"") was adopted to indicate the stranger. Participants were also informed that the same-sex stranger had been randomly selected from among the participants of another experiment, and that they would never meet.

The formal experiment consisted of six blocks (two blocks for every target). Presentation order of these blocks was counterbalanced across participants. At the beginning of each block, an instruction indicating a self, friend, or stranger block was shown to the participants for 5000 ms. Within each block, 40 trials were presented in a pseudo-random order in which no more than three successive trials were from the same decision situation, consisting of five repetitions for each of the eight combinations (four combinations for each of gain and loss). The experimental procedure for every trial was the same as in Study 1. In total, each participant performed 240 trials. The method of reward payment was also the same as in Study 1. Reward payments regarding decisions for their friends were administered in the same fashion as those for decisions for themselves. Participants were given a ¥30 initial endowment before the experiment began so that they could pay any eventual losses regarding decisions for their friends at the end of the experiment. They were informed that the computer would randomly select one trial from the friend trials at the end of the experiment, and the outcome of the selected trial would be added to or subtracted from the initial endowment, and a payment would be made depending on their actual choice for their friends during the experiment.

Before the formal experiment, each participant performed 12 practice trials to familiarize themselves with the experimental task. After the experimental task, participants answered two yes/no questions: ""Do you strongly doubt that the decisions for your friend during the task were real?"" and ""Do you strongly doubt that the decisions for the stranger during the task were real?"" (used for the exclusion of participants; see Method, Participants and design).

After the experimental task, participants were also asked to complete a 5-point scale to rate their emotional response to the potential outcomes. Specifically, participants were required to evaluate how they felt if their choices lead to themselves'/their friends'/the stranger's gains/losses in the gain/loss situation (1 = ""very unhappy"" to 5 = ""very happy"").

Participants were subsequently required to complete the Chinese version of the inclusion of other in the self (IOS; Aron et al., 1992) scale. The IOS measures, with different degrees of overlap between two circles (ranging from 1 to 7; higher scores representing more inclusion), described the perceived closeness between the participants themselves and their friends as well as the stranger. As in previous studies (Wu et al., 2011; Yu et al., 2015), the IOS scale was used to check the manipulation of social distance in the present study.

### Results and Discussion

#### Manipulation Check of Social Distance

Eighty-two participants' self-reports regarding the IOS revealed that they generally had close relationships with their friends. Participants' self-reports regarding IOS demonstrated that they had closer relationships with their friends (M = 6.22, SD = 0.61) than with the stranger (M = 1.41, SD = 0.50), t(81) = 45.87, p < 0.001.

#### Risk Rate

A 3 (social distance: self, friend, stranger) x 2 (decision situation: gain, loss) within-subjects ANOVA with repeated measures was conducted on risk rate2. The main effect of social distance was significant, F(2,162) = 12.00, p < 0.001, n3 = 0.13. Pairwise comparisons revealed that the risk rate was significantly higher when making decisions for the self (M = 0.54, SD = 0.10) than for friend (M = 0.52, SD = 0.09, p = 0.035) and stranger (M = 0.49, SD = 0.14, p < 0.001). Moreover, the risk rate was significantly higher when making decisions for friend than for stranger (p = 0.033). The main effect of decision situation was also significant, F(1,81) = 58.12, p < 0.001, nº = 0.42. The risk rate in gain situations (M = 0.45, SD = 0.08) was significantly lower than that in loss situations (M = 0.59, SD = 0.15).

More interestingly, a significant interaction between social distance and decision situation was observed (see Figure 3), F(2,162) = 35.85, p < 0.001, n = 0.31. Follow-up simple effects analyses revealed the following. In gain situations, the risk

![](_page_5_Figure_12.jpeg)

rate difference between different social distance was significant, F(2,162) = 4.50, p = 0.022. n = 0.05. Specifically, the risk rate was significantly lower when making decisions for the self (M = 0.43, SD = 0.12) than for stranger (M = 0.48, SD = 0.14, p = 0.037). However, the risk rate did not differ significantly between making decisions for the self and for friend (M = 0.45, SD = 0.12, p = 0.452), and was also not significant between making decisions for friend and for stranger (p = 0.239). In loss situations, the risk rate difference was also significant across the social distances, F(2,162) = 51.23, p < 0.001, mp = 0.39. More specifically, risk rate was significantly higher when making decisions for the self (M = 0.66, SD = 0.20) than for friend (M = 0.60, SD = 0.17, p = 0.001) and for stranger (M = 0.50, SD = 0.17, p < 0.001). Moreover, risk rate was also significantly higher when making decisions for friend than for stranger (p < 0.001).

#### Mediation Analyses

Of additional interest was whether loss aversion differences between social distances might account for the different pattern of risk preferences. In order to calculate loss aversion values, we first conducted inverse integration on the subjective ratings of unhappiness toward losses. Loss aversion can be indicated by the differences between unhappiness ratings of losses and happiness ratings of gains in the present study. We used techniques suggested by Judd et al. (2001) for testing mediation in withinsubject designs.

The first criterion for mediation is that the independent variable (i.e., social distance) must affect the dependent variables (i.e., the risk rate difference between loss and gain situations). It was met by an analysis showing that the risk rate difference between loss and gain situations in different social distance conditions was significant, F(2,162) = 35.85, p < 0.001, n2 = 0.31. The risk rate difference between loss and gain situations was significantly larger when making decisions for the self (M = 0.23, SD = 0.26) than for friend (M = 0.16, SD = 0.22, p = 0.005) and for stranger (M = 0.01, SD = 0.13, p < 0.001). Moreover, it was also significantly larger when making decisions for friend than for stranger (p < 0.001).

<sup>2</sup> The data without any participants excluded were also analyzed. In this case, the main effects of social distance and decision situation were less robust, and the interaction between social distance and decision situation was also less robust when every participant was included. The simple effects for gain situations were more robust, whereas the simple effects were weaker for loss situations. More detailed results with no participants excluded are reported in the Supplementary Materials.

The second criterion for mediation is that the independent variable must affect the mediating variables (i.e., loss aversion). This was also met by an analysis indicating that loss aversion differences were significant across social distance conditions, F(2,162) = 14.08, p < 0.001, np = 0.15. Loss aversion was significantly stronger when making decisions for the self (M = 0.56, SD = 1.29) than for friend (M = 0.30, SD = 1.12, p = 0.022) or stranger (M = - 0.09, SD = 0.74, p < 0.001). Moreover, it was also significantly stronger when making decisions for friend than for stranger (p = 0.01).

For the third criterion, mediation was tested by computing the risk rate differences between each two targets for the difference of loss minus gain situation, respectively, and then regressing this risk rate difference on two predictors: the sum of each participant's loss aversion scores for each two decision targets, and its difference between the two decision targets (see Judd et al., 2001). As shown in Table 1, loss aversion completely mediated the effects of social distance (self vs. friend) on the risk rate difference between loss and gain situations (assuming that the sum variable was centered), and partially mediated the effects of social distance (self vs. stranger and friend vs. stranger) on the risk rate difference between loss and gain situations.

In summary, Study 2 further supports the findings of Study 1, indicating that people were more risk averse in gain situations when making decisions for themselves than for a stranger, and were equally risk averse for themselves and their friends, and were also equally risk averse for their friends and a stranger. However, people were more risk seeking in loss situations when making decisions for themselves than for their friends which, in turn, were also more risk seeking than for a stranger. These findings once again showed that social distance significantly influences decision makers' risk preferences in both gain and loss situations, and moreover, that the effect is stronger in loss frames than in gain frames. In addition, Study 2 demonstrated that the loss aversion induced by potential decision outcomes was responsible for these findings. Participants experienced more loss aversion associated with certain losses derived from a sure prospect in loss situations, and thus, they were more risk seeking when making decisions for themselves than for their friends or for a stranger. On the other hand, they also experienced more loss aversion associated with potential losses derived from a risky prospect in gain situations, which led to more risk-averse behaviors when making decisions for themselves than for a stranger.

# GENERAL DISCUSSION

The present research revealed that people were more risk averse in gain situations when making decisions for themselves than for a stranger (Studies 1 and 2), and were equally risk averse for themselves and their friends under such conditions (Study 2). However, people were more risk seeking in loss situations when making decisions for themselves than for their friends, and also more risk seeking for their friends than stranger. These findings indicated that social distance has a robust effect on decision makers' risk preferences in both gain and loss situations. Moreover, the effect of social distance is stronger in loss than gain situations. Furthermore, our research revealed that the loss aversion induced by potential outcomes was responsible for the effects of social distance, which indicated that selfother differences in decision making under risk may be driven primarily by emotion.

### Social Distance and Risk Preference

Our research extends Ziegler and Tunney' (2015) study by showing that the effect of social distance is stronger in loss situations than in gain situations, whereas Ziegler and Tunney (2015) showed that this effect was slightly stronger in gain situations than in loss situations where this effect was only approaches significance. Additionally, in the gain frame, our research replicates and extends the two previous studies (Raue et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2016), however, in the loss frame, stands in contrast to them that have reported there was no significant effect of social distance on risk preference in loss frames. This inconsistency between the present findings and these earlier results may be due to either differences in the ""others"" manipulation or the reward payment used in the studies. The ""others"" used in the present study were concrete targets both in Study 1 (a concrete stranger) and Study 2 (a concrete friend and stranger), whereas previous studies have used an imaginary or abstract target to indicate the ""other."" Crucially, individuals' risk preference is driven by their emotional reactions to risk (Hsee and Weber, 1997; Loewenstein et al., 2001). When making decisions for a concrete ""other,"" individuals base their decision partly on their own emotional reactions toward risk, and how much individuals base their decision on their own emotional reactions depends on how concrete the other is. When making decisions for an abstract ""other,"" people likely find it more difficult

Following Judd et al. (2011, mediation of effects of a dependent variable Y by a mediator X was tested with the equation Yo = do + d } } + d z the difference between the social distance conditions in Y, X ¿ is the sum of X in both conditions, and X is the difference between social distance conditions in X. In all displayed regressions, the tested mediator X was loss aversion.

to imagine how the other feels about risk, which indicates a lack of particular feelings and contributes to risk neutrality when making decisions for the ""other"" (Hsee and Weber, 1997). If this account is accurate, concreteness of target would be expected to have a major impact on decision makers' risk preferences.

 Of course, use of different reward payment could also impact the pattern of findings obtained. Participants in previous studies received the same gifts (Sun et al., 2016), the same course credit (Raue et al., 2015), or a financial reward that comprised outcomes for all choices in the self condition and in the previous but one participant condition (Ziegler and Tunney, 2015). Rewards that do not depend on task performance or that are partly dependent on the choices from others maybe contribute to similar riskseeking behaviors regardless of decision-making target. In the present research, participants were given an initial endowment before the experiment began, and were told that one trial in the self condition would be randomly selected at the end of the experiment and a payment made depending on their actual choice. This design could increase participants' emotional engagement, more importantly, because participants did not know which trial would be selected, and thus they should treat every trial independently (De Martino et al., 2010; Suzuki et al., 2016).

In addition, Stone et al. (2002), Stone and Allgaier (2008) found that there was no difterence in risk-taking behavior between decisions for the self and friend in monetary gain situations. They also showed that, in low-impact relationship situations (e.g., introducing him- or herself at a party), people were more risk-averse when making decisions for the self than for friends or a typical student, and there was no difference between making decisions for friends and for a typical student, whereas no self-other differences have been observed in highimpact relationship situations (e.g., eloping with someone) (Stone and Allgaier, 2008). In addition, people were more risk-seeking when making decisions for themselves than for their friends in physical safety situations (e.g., taking diet pills), but were more risk-averse in romantic relationship situations (e.g., asking an attractive person to dance) (Stone et al., 2013). Stone and Allgaier (2008) suggested that decision making for others is heavily dependent on the social value placed on risk, which they termed the ""social values analysis."" Risk taking is valued in lowimpact relationship situations but is not valued in high-impact relationship and monetary situations (Stone and Allgaier, 2008), whereas risk aversion is valued in physical safety situations (Stone et al., 2013). Thus, our findings are basically consistent with the social values analysis. Individuals tend to make more risk-seeking decisions for stranger than for themselves in gain situations, because risk taking is more valued under such circumstances. However, individuals tend to be more risk-averse when making decisions for their friends and stranger than for themselves in loss situations, because risk aversion is more valued in these scenarios.

# Other Mechanisms for Social Distance Affects Risk Preference

The present research investigated loss aversion as a potential mediator of the influence of social distance on risk preference. However, other mechanisms may also exist. Construal level represents one such mechanism. According to the construal level theory (Trope et al., 2007; Trope and Liberman, 2010), psychological distance (in terms of social distance, space, time, and hypotheticality) has an impact on human decision making by activating a certain level of construal. Psychological closeness is associated with low-level, concrete construals, whereas psychological distance is associated with high-level, abstract construals. Use of low-level, concrete construals leads individuals to focus more on the feasibility of an action (e.g., the possibility of a gain), whereas the use of highlevel, abstract construals shifts more focus onto desirability (e.g., attractiveness of a gain). Therefore, people might be more risk averse in gain situations and more risk seeking in loss situations when making decisions for close social distance targets due to activating a low-level construal, and it maybe go just the opposite for distant social distance targets.

Another possible explanation for the observed effect of social distance on risk preference is the reference point. The current state of individuals is represented based on a reference point, and gains and losses are thus weighed relative to this point (Epley et al., 2004; Epley and Gilovich, 2006). However, decision-makers have no reference point for the current state of others, and they would resort more to risk neutrality when making decisions for distant social targets.

# Theoretical Contributions and Practical Implications

Our findings contribute to prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979) by showing that risk preference varies based on social distance. In the close social distance condition, people tend to be risk averse in gain frames and risk seeking in loss frames. However, greater social distance makes people become more risk-neutral in both gain and loss frames. These findings indicate that the prospect theory is more applicable to explain decisions for close social distance targets rather than distant targets. Additionally, the present research revealed that social distance has a stronger effect on decision makers' risk preference in loss frames than in gain frames, and that loss aversion is responsible for this effect of social distance. These findings shed new light on self-other decision-making differences in risk preference.

Our findings also have potential practical implications. For instance, asset managers tend to be more rational (i.e., riskneutral) when making decisions for their investors than for themselves. In addition, it is best for physicians not to make medical decisions when the decision targets are themselves or their friends, because the close social distance may hamper professional judgment. Our findings also have potential implications for understanding substance abuse and addictive behaviors. In the real world, people often face a variety of losses. Our findings imply that the more susceptible to losses could potentially contribute to increases in behaviors resulting in maladaptive outcomes such as pathological gambling, drugtaking, and substance abuse.

# Limitations and Directions for Future Research

We acknowledge several potential caveats to this research. Although we have revealed significant effects of social distance on risk preferences in both gain and loss situations, potential differences based on subjective value or some aspect of subjective value such as expected value, reward probability, reward magnitude, and stochasticity, have not been clearly identified. Thus, future research is needed to explore the computational mechanisms underlying the differences using model fitting. For example, researchers can estimate the risk preference parameter based on cumulative prospect theory (CPT, Tversky and Kahneman, 1992) by fitting a model to the participant's choice data (i.e., estimating the parameter values that maximize the likelihood function). Such research could try to pinpoint what aspects of the choice process are altered and may shed further light on the mechanisms underlying the effect of social distance on risk preference.

# CONCLUSION

Across two experiments, social distance and decision situation interacted to affect individuals' risk preference. People were more risk averse in gain situations when making decisions for themselves than for a stranger but were equally risk averse for themselves and for their friends. They were more risk seeking in loss situations when making decisions for themselves than for their friends which, in turn, were more risk seeking than for a stranger. Moreover, the effect of social distance on risk preference was stronger in loss situations than in gain situations, and loss aversion induced by potential outcomes was responsible for the effects of social distance. Taken together, our findings indicate that social distance dramatically affects decision makers'

Previous research has shown a positive relation between character strengths, wellbeing and health. The aim of this analysis was to identify relations between the application of signature character strengths (ASCS) at work, and well-being and health, among medical students (Study 1) and resident physicians (Study 2). We expected positive direct links between the constructs and indirect effects through emotional exhaustion. To test these hypotheses, 387 medical students in their first year and 136 resident physicians completed five scales measuring well-being, mental/physical health, character strengths, the application of their five individual signature strengths, and emotional exhaustion as an indicator of burnout. Partial correlations were examined, and mediation analyses performed. ASCS at work was positively linked with well-being and mental health but not with physical health. All links were mediated by emotional exhaustion in Study 1 and (except for mental health) also in Study 2. Future studies would therefore do well to investigate the promotion of ASCS at work of people operating in medical education and its potential in fostering well-being and preventing burnout from the outset.

### INTRODUCTION

Positive psychology is a science that deals with three domains: (1) positive subjective experiences, (2) positive traits, and (3) positive institutions (Seligman and Csikszentmihalyi, 2000). Positive experiences include well-being, optimism, and happiness. Positive traits are individual characteristics such as virtues and talents. Lastly, positive institutions, such as universities or hospitals, can support personal growth and positive experiences (Seligman and Csikszentmihaly), 2000; Ruch, 2008). Concerning the first domain, there are many alarming studies reporting burnout (Dyrbye et al., 2008; Dyrbye et al., 2014), (dis-)satisfaction (Shanafelt et al., 2009; Lebensohn et al., 2013), reduced quality of life (West et al., 2011; Beckman et al., 2012), fatigue (West et al, 2009), and other health restrictions of medical students and practitioners. Studies showing that physicians' satisfaction is positively associated with patient satisfaction, efficient health care, physicians' health and negatively associated with turnover, burnout, and costs demonstrate that the physicians' well-being matters not only for themselves, but also for their patients and the health care system in general (Brown and Gunderman, 2006). A first study

1

(Hausler et al., 2017b) found that different well-being aspects are positively related with character strengths in a sample of medical students at two points in time. This leads to the second domain of positive traits. There are promising results that the application of signature character strengths (ASCS) has positive effects on wellbeing and health (Peterson and Seligman, 2004; Harzer and Ruch, 2013). The third domain takes the context (e.g., work or study context) into account (Seligman and Csikszentmihalyi, 2000).

In positive psychology the focus is not on health as the absence of illness, but on health as the ""presence of the positive"" (Ryff, 1995, p. 99). Emphasis is thus placed on nurturing wellbeing and character strengths. In order to get more information about possibilities to promote the well-being and the working conditions of physicians-to-be, preventing of burnout, fatigue, or other restrictions of well-being is an important task for academic research (Seligman and Csikszentmihalyi, 2000; McClafferty and Brown, 2014).

This analysis emphasizes the first two domains of positive psychology (including well-being and character strengths), in particular as there is a clear research gap in the context of ASCS of medical students and resident physicians. Moreover this analysis takes additional variables of the third domain (hospital vs. study context) into account, distinguishing it from mainstream research. This research is the first to analyze relations between ASCS, well-being and health of medical students in their first year (Study 1) and resident physicians working at two hospitals in Austria (Study 2).

### Well-being and Health in Medical Education

Well-being has been described in the theoretical and empirical literature to have several aspects: On the one hand, there is subjective well-being (SWB), which encompasses the presence of positive emotions, absence of negative emotions, and satisfaction with life as a whole. On the other, there is psychological wellbeing, which includes aspects such as engagement, relationships, meaning, mastery, and optimism (Su et al., 2014). Well-being and health are a particularly essential issue for people operating in medical education. Mental as well as physical health status is an essential precondition for, and outcome of, a successful educational process. Even though burnout is not limited to the social sector, besides general health aspects, burnout seems to be a relevant issue to medical students and (resident) physicians. There is consensus among most researchers in the field that burnout contains three main dimensions: emotional exhaustion, cynicism/depersonalization, and reduced professional efficacy (Maslach et al., 2001). The construct of emotional exhaustion is a key dimension of burnout, and defined as ""a state of losing mental and psychological resources that has an impact on the quantity of mood, such as depleting and draining mental energy"" (Nuallaong, 2013). ""Burnout is defined as work-related neurasthenia"" (p. 102), which is frequently measured by the single burnout component ""emotional exhaustion."" According to Maslach et al. (2009), focusing on this key component in lieu of the other two is the current practice in burnout research for the work context. Research has shown that burnout, and

especially the key dimension of emotional exhaustion, is related to physical health outcomes (e.g., cardiovascular disease, diabetes, infections) and mental illness (Shirom et al., 2005). There is strong empirical evidence that burnout is an outcome of task- and organization-related working conditions (demands, stressors, and resources) and has further effects on general well-being and health (Schaufeli et al., 2009).

Research has shown well-being, health and burnout to be important issues for medical students and (resident) physicians. Dyrbye et al. (2014) reported very high burnout rates of 56% among medical students, 60% among resident physicians, and 51% among physicians, compared to the general population. According to their representative studies of 2011 and 2012 in the United States, resident physicians had a higher likelihood of burnout, and medical students of depression, compared to the general population and to other courses of studies (Brazeau et al., 2014). In particular, reports of burnout, distress, and depression in samples of German-speaking medical students (e.g., Kohls et al., 2012; Voltmer et al., 2012), resident physicians (e.g., von dem Knesebeck et al., 2010) as well as experienced physicians (e.g., Heinke et al., 2011; Wurm et al., 2016) correspond to findings in the United States.

### Character Strengths and Their Application

The Job Demands-Resources Model (Bakker and Demerouti, 2007) is an occupational stress model, which distinguishes between job demands (e.g., time or work pressure, detrimental working conditions) and resources (e.g., autonomy, social support). An accumulation of demands leads to a ""health impairment process"" including negative consequences like burnout. In contrast, a ""motivational process"" is activated through resources, which can lead to higher work engagement and performance. The risk of burnout or health problems arising due to potential stressors such as high job demands can be buffered by job resources. Especially in contexts characterized by a rigid organizational hierarchy and by conditions that are difficult to change - like hospitals - it is well worth also taking personal resources of employees into account. Peterson and Seligman (2004) offer a promising concept of personal resources: the ASCS. In 2004 they described 24 human character strengths which are measurable as individual differences via the Values in Action Inventory of Strengths (VIA-IS). The character strengths were grouped into six historically based universal human virtues (namely courage, justice, humanity, temperance, transcendence, and wisdom). Peterson and Seligman (2004) assume that every person has about three to seven character strengths, which are typical of the individual. These so-called signature strengths are defined as strengths which fulfill several criteria such as ""a sense of ownership and authenticity,"" ""intrinsic motivation to use the strength"" or ""a feeling of excitement while displaying it ( . . )"" (Peterson and Seligman, 2004, p. 18).

Whereas the early years of character strengths research studied strengths possession (by analyzing the means of character strengths), in the recent years an additional focus was placed on the applicability of character strengths in specific contexts.

Harzer and Ruch (2013) developed the Applicability of Character Strengths Rating Scales (ACS-RS) to ""measure the extent to which each of the 24 character strengths of the VIA classification is applicable"" in work or private life. Harzer and Ruch (2013) made it possible to measure how situational circumstances foster or hinder an individual in behaving in ways relevant to a specific strength. Moreover, the questionnaire enables to distinguish between several contexts, which allows for a more detailed analysis. The applicability of character strengths and especially of signature character strengths is assumed to be correlated with well-being and health by Peterson and Seligman (2004). Studies actually showed associations with a broad range of positive outcomes such as life satisfaction (e.g., Allan and Duffy, 2014; Douglass and Dufty, 2014; Harzer and Ruch, 2016), difterent wellbeing aspects (Harzer and Ruch, 2012, 2013), positive experiences at work including academic or job satisfaction (Littman-Ovadia and Steger, 2010; Harzer and Ruch, 2013; Allan and Duffy, 2014; Lavy and Littman-Ovadia, 2017), and employee engagement (Crabb, 2011; Lavy and Littman-Ovadia, 2017). Studies analyzing character strengths also found positive correlates with healthier work-related behaviors (Gander et al., 2012) and self-evaluated health and physical health in terms of cardio-respiratory fitness, strength, flexibility, and coordination (Proyer et al., 2013), which is congruent with Peterson and Seligman's theoretical assumption that characters strengths are related to (mental and physical) health (Peterson and Seligman, 2004; Peterson and Park, 2011).

So far, there has rarely been research on character strengths and their applicability in the context of medical education. Ruiz-Aranda et al. (2014) found a relationship between social intelligence (which is also a character strength according to Peterson and Seligman, 2004) and SWB of female student health professionals in a 3 months follow-up. After 12 weeks, students with higher social intelligence reported lower stress levels, higher life satisfaction and happiness. The relationship between social intelligence and well-being was mediated by perceived stress. This shows that high social intelligence increases well-being by reducing the experience of stress. In conclusion, the authors recommend the inclusion of training programs to foster social intelligence in medical curriculums. Some medical universities are already implementing positive psychological interventions, fostering study/work engagement, and taking steps to prevent burnout (Pedrals et al., 2010). Moreover, research has shown that identifying and encouraging students' strengths and talents is positively correlated with various well-being aspects (Schreiner et al., 2008). Considering the particular stressors and challenges faced by individuals in the health care profession, resources like the ASCS are expected to contribute to preventing burnout, and moreover may promote general well-being and health (e.g., Harzer and Ruch, 2013). Lavy and Littman-Ovadia (2017) assume that the broaden-and-build theory of Fredrickson (2001) works as an underlying mechanism. On this view, positive emotions may be responsible for the positive effects of the application of character strengths on desirable (work-related) outcomes (e.g., Lavy and Littman-Ovadia, 2017). The other way round negative emotions or states (e.g., stress or emotional exhaustion) are also supposed to be negatively related with well-being and health. Similar to perceived stress (Ruiz-Aranda et al., 2014) emotional

exhaustion may also have an indirect effect on the links between ASCS, well-being and health, which is the main focus of the present analysis.

### Aims and Hypotheses of the Present Two Studies

The alarming results of impaired health and well-being of health professionals show the need to address the issues surrounding the well-being, health and risk for burnout of medical students and physicians. The promotion of career satisfaction and the prevention of burnout, especially in the beginning of the career, should be aspired to (Dyrbye et al., 2013). The presented theoretical background suggests that ASCS may influence wellbeing, mental health, and physical health directly as well as indirectly, by way of decreasing burnout symptoms. Taking work and organizational psychology models into account, the specific context (study vs. hospital) was expected to make a difference for whether circumstances would facilitate or hinder ASCS. We conducted two studies to examine the research questions outlined in the following in two different samples: (1) medical students in their first year of studies and (2) resident physicians working in hospitals.

Firstly, character strengths matter in the working context as previous studies have shown (e.g., Gander et al., 2012; Harzer and Ruch, 2013). In the first study, we analyzed the potential positive effects of ASCS in relation to well-being, mental health, and physical health of medical students in their first year of study. We hypothesized that ASCS would be positively linked to well-being (Hypothesis 1a), mental health (Hypothesis 2a), and physical health (Hypothesis 3a). Secondly, referring to the Job Demands-Resources model (Bakker and Demerouti, 2007) ASCS could be seen as individual resource in the working context, which may positively impact work engagement and counteract burnout (low ASCS increases the risk for burnout) in a motivational process (e.g., Schaufeli et al., 2009). Research showed evidence for the effects of burnout on general well-being and mental health (Shirom et al., 2005; Cole et al., 2012). Based on this theoretical background, we hypothesized that the relations between ASCS and well-being, mental health, and physical health all are mediated by emotional exhaustion (Hypothesis 4a, 5a, 6a).

In the second study, we aimed to replicate the hypotheses as depicted above in a sample of resident physicians working in hospitals. Again, we expected direct positive relations between ASCS and well-being (Hypothesis 1b), mental health (Hypothesis 2b), and physical health (Hypothesis 3b), as well as indirect effects via emotional exhaustion (Hypothesis 4b, 5b, 6b).

Additionally, following Harzer and Ruch (2013), we expected the specific context and stage of education (first year of medical studies vs. residency) and the different kinds of work (studying and learning vs. working in medical care) to make a difference for ASCS, well-being and health. We hypothesized that medical students have more opportunities to use their character strengths compared to resident physicians working in hospitals (Hypothesis 7) and therefore also have higher levels of well-being (Hypothesis 8), mental health (Hypothesis 9), and physical health (Hypothesis 10).

a Desired discipline of medical students, current discipline where resident physicians are working in.

### STUDY 1

Study 1 was designed to examine Hypotheses 1a, 2a, 3a, 4a, 5a, and 6a in a sample of medical students. ASCS was investigated in relation to well-being, mental, and physical health. Furthermore, investigating emotional exhaustion as a possible mediator was a central focus of the study.

### Method

#### Participants and Procedure

We recruited three samples of medical students in their first year of studies (January and February, 2015, 2016, and 2017) for an online survey and sent 1488 recruitment emails and two reminders. Incentives offered were direct feedback on participants' individual five signature character strengths, medical education credits, and a raffle of medical books and vouchers. The response rate was 32% (N = 480). We found no significant differences between the three measurement times regarding the dependent variables. We collected complete data of 387 medical students at an Austrian medical university. Sixty-four percent were female with a mean age of 20.7 years (SD = 2.5). Most were Austrian (54%) nationals and single (67.4%). The students spent an average of 39 h per week studying (SD = 14.9 h, range 2-85). Twenty-four percent reported a

secondary employment with an average of 8.7 h per week (SD = 4.4 h, range 2-30 h). Detailed demographics can be found in Table 1.

#### Instruments

The Comprehensive Inventory of Thriving (CIT) (Su et al., 2014) was used to measure well-being. It comprises 54 items rated on a five-point Likert scale and ranges from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree. The CIT measures subjective and psychological well-being including items measuring positive emotions, relationships, engagement, autonomy, meaning in life, mastery, and optimism. Sample items are ""My life is going well"" or ""I am achieving most of my goals."" The German translation has shown to be valid and reliable (Hausler et al., 2017a). The CIT has an excellent internal consistency with a = 0.94 for SWB and α = 0.91 for PWB in the sample of freshmen.

The German version of the Short Form Health Survey (RAND-SF-12) (Bullinger and Kirchberger, 1998) measures mental and physical health composite scores (MCS and PCS) within the last 4 weeks with 12 items. The composite scores are computed by regression with different weights. Sample items are ""In the past 4 weeks, did you accomplish less than you would like as a result of an emotional problem, such as feeling depressed or anxious?"" (MCS) or ""Thinking about the past 4 weeks, have you

The German 120 item version of the Values in Action Inventory of Strengths (VIA) (Via Institute on Character, 2014) was used to measure individual character strengths. The scale ranges from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree. Psychometric properties in our study were similar to the original 240 items version with Cronbachs a ranging from a = 0.65 (hope) to α = 0.89 (spirituality) for the short version (Littman-Ovadia, 2015). Sample items are ""I have many interests"" (curiosity) or ""I feel thankful for what I have received in life"" (gratitude). Several studies have shown the factorial validity of the original version (e.g., Harzer and Ruch, 2013, 2015).

The German Applicability of Character Strengths Rating Scales (ASCS-RS) (Harzer and Ruch, 2013) were used to evaluate the applicability of individual character strengths in their studies. Harzer and Ruch describe that the combination of the VIA-120 and the ACS-RS ""allows for an operationalization of the strengths-related congruence between an individual and the situational circumstances at work. This congruence is proportional to the extent to which a job allows for the application of one's signature strengths"" (Harzer and Ruch, 2012, pp. 5-6).

According to Peterson and Seligman (2004), every person has about three to seven character strengths, which are typical of the individual. Based on this assumption, applicability in student life was measured for each participant's five highest character strengths identified within the VIA survey. Each of these individual character strengths was addressed with four questions in the ASCS scale, rated on a five-point scale from 1 = never to 5 = (almost) always. The items inquire whether the strength is encouraged, helps the individual, is important, and to which extent it is possible to act according to the strength in the respective context. A good internal consistency of the ASCS-RS with a = 0.84 was found in the present study.

Emotional exhaustion, the key dimension of burnout, was measured using the adapted and modified German student version of the Maslach-Burnout-Inventory (MBI-SS-GV) by Gumz et al. (2013). It consists of 21 items with a six-point scale from 1 = never to 7 = very often, and showed good reliability (α = 0.87). A sample item is ""I feel burnt out from my work.""

#### Data Analysis

Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics 22. Frequencies, means, and SD were used to describe the sample characteristics. Correlations and regressions including mediations were designated. The latter were calculated with the SPSS macro PROCESS by Preacher and Hayes (Hayes, 2013). The mediation analyses were based on bootstrapping (10,000 bootstrap samples) using 95% confidence intervals. The macro allows calculating and testing the direct effect (regression controlled for the mediator), the total effect (regression without including the mediator), and the indirect effect. The latter is significant when the 95% CI does not include 0. Sex, age, and marital status were included as controls.

### Results

First, in the preliminary analyses several outliers (ACS-RS: N = 2; PWB: N = 1; SWB: N = 1; PCS: N = 3) could be identified and were deleted (critical z-value of ±3.29) resulting in a final N = 387. The PWB and ASCS-RS scores were normally distributed |Kolmogorov-Smirnoff Test (KS-test), histogram |. SWB, PCS, MCS, and MBI-EE were non-normally distributed with the following values of skewness (SE = 0.12) and kurtosis (SE = 0.25) for SWB (-0.71; 0.44), PCS (-1.04; 1.05), MCS (-0.30; -1.05), and MBI-EE (0.44; 0.194). This shows that students were relatively physically and mentally healthy, reported little emotional exhaustion and high SWB.

Second, means, SD, and internal consistencies of the measures were computed. Third, relations of the variables with demographics (age, sex, marital status) were calculated, as proposed in several studies (e.g., Harzer and Ruch, 2012; Wagner and Ruch, 2015). Men showed a statistically higher mental health than women (r = 0.17; p < 0.001), older students had lower scores in ASCS (r = - 0.12; p = 0.020), and marital status had no statistical effect. All subsequent analyses were controlled for the demographics of sex, age, and marital status.

Partial correlation analyses showed significant relationships of ASCS with all variables except physical health. Effect sizes were moderate for well-being and small for mental health. Hypothesis 1a (well-being) and 2a (mental health) were confirmed; Hypothesis 3a (physical health) was not (Table 2).

Based on these results, emotional exhaustion was analyzed as a possible mediator (Table 3). Results showed a significant indirect effect of emotional exhaustion on SWB and PWB (Figure 1). Hypothesis 4a was thus confirmed for both well-being aspects.

Moreover, a significant indirect effect of emotional exhaustion on mental health was found (Table 3). Therefore, Hypotheses 5a was also confirmed.

No impact of ASCS on physical health was found in the previous correlational analyses. Nevertheless, a significant indirect effect through emotional exhaustion was found. Interpretation was based on Hayes' (2013) statement that interpreting a significant effect is reasonable even if there is no significant total effect. Thus, Hypothesis 6a was also confirmed.

#### Summary of Results of Study 1

Results of Study 1 showed that ASCS was significantly related to the well-being and mental health but not the physical health of medical students. We found significant indirect effects of emotional exhaustion on all three direct links.

## STUDY 2

Aim of Study 2 was to replicate the findings of Study 1 in a sample of resident physicians working in hospitals. A further aim was to compare the results and the initial levels of well-being, ASCS, mental and physical health between the two samples to take the differences between the study and work context into account.

### Method

### Participants and Procedure

At three time points (2015-2016) a total of 1266 recruitment emails and two reminders were sent to resident physicians. Resident physicians are physicians in training, having worked in a hospital between three and a half and six years. They have finished medical school, have a medical degree and are supervised during their work at the hospital. Out of 236 respondents (19%), datasets for 157 participants were complete. The resident physicians were 2 months minimum on the job. Nineteen had already finished their residency and were therefore excluded. Data was gathered through an online survey. Incentives offered were direct feedback of participants' individual five signature character strengths, and vouchers for brunch. Again, no significant differences between the three measurement times regarding the dependent variables were found.

Complete data of 136 resident physicians were collected in two hospitals in Austria (Table 1). 65.4% of the resident physicians were female, with a mean age of 32.0 years (SD = 4.8, range: 24-49). Most were Austrian (71.3%) nationals, most were in a partnership (75.7%), and 25% had children. Most of the resident physicians were living with their partner or family (65.4%). The resident physicians reported an average contractual working time of 39.94 h (SD = 7.94) and an actual working time of 48.76 h (SD = 10.00) per week.

#### Instruments

Again, well-being was measured with the CIT (Su et al., 2014), health was measured with the RAND-SF-12 (Bullinger and Kirchberger, 1998), character strength possession with the 120 items of the VIA-IS (Via Institute on Character, 2014) and the applicability of each participant's signature character strengths with the ACS-RS (Harzer and Ruch, 2013). In contrast to study 1, burnout was measured with scales specifically addressing the work context, again focusing on the key component of burnout: Emotional exhaustion was measured with the adapted and modified German version of the Maslach-Burnout-Inventory for the work context of human services from 1 = never to 6 = very often (MBI-D; Büssing and Perrar, 1992). The Cronbach's Alphas of the 24 VIA-120 scales ranged from α = 0.60 (authenticity) to α = 0.90 (spirituality). All other scales had satisfying reliabilities throughout (Table 2).

### Data Analysis

Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics 22. Frequencies, means (M), and SD were used to describe the sample characteristics. Analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) were used to compare the means between the samples. Correlations and regressions including mediators and covariates (sex, age, and marital status) were examined. The latter were calculated with the SPSS macro PROCESS by Preacher and Hayes (Hayes, 2013).

### Results

In the preliminary analyses two outliers (SWB: N = 1; PCS: N = 1) could be identified (critical z-value of ±3.29) and were deleted. The final dataset consisted of N = 136 resident physicians. MBI-EE, ASCS, and PWB were normally distributed (KS-test, histogram). SWB, PCS, and MCS were non-normally distributed with the following values of skewness (SE = 0.21) and kurtosis (SE = 0.41) for SWB (-0.65; 0.38), PCS (-1.28; 1.05), and MCS (-0.70; -0.44). This shows that the resident physicians, too, were relatively healthy and had high SWB. Means, SD, and reliability of the instruments were computed. The means at tl

and t2 were then compared for statistical differences (ANCOVA). Lastly, possible covariates were analyzed. Sex, age, and marital status had no statistical effect. As in Study 1 all subsequent analyses were again controlled for demographics.

Correlation analyses showed that ASCS was significantly (p < 0.05) correlated with SWB, PWB, and mental health but not with physical health or burnout (Table 2). Effect sizes were moderate for PWB and small for SWB and mental health. Results confirmed Hypotheses 1b and 2b, but not 3b.

Emotional exhaustion was found to have a significant indirect effect on SWB, PWB, and physical health. No significant indirect effect on mental health was identified. Thus, Hypotheses 4b (for both well-being aspects) and 6b were confirmed; Hypothesis 5b was not (Table 4).

#### Summary of Results of Study 2

Results of Study 2 showed that ASCS was significantly related to well-being and mental health, but not to physical health of resident physicians. We identified significant indirect effects of emotional exhaustion on the links between ASCS and well-being and ASCS and physical health. We found no significant indirect effect on the ASCS-mental health link. All indirect effects were relatively small in Study 2.

## COMPARISON OF STUDY 1 AND 2

Several ANCOVAs were conducted to examine the differences between the two samples concerning their ASCS, well-being, and health. The ANCOVAs were computed with sample (sample 1 vs. sample 2) as between-subject factor, demographics (sex, age, and marital status) as covariates, and SWB, PWB, ASCS, MCS, and PCS as dependent variables. Results indicated significant differences between the two samples in the dependent variables of ASCS and mental health after controlling for demographics (Table 5). Thus, results showed that resident physicians had significantly higher means of ASCS and mental health compared with medical students. Both samples had similar means of SWB, PWB, and physical health.

In addition, we compared the differences between the correlation coefficients (ASCS, well-being, and health scores) between Studies 1 and 2 with each other. We found no significant differences (Fisher's z-transformation). In conclusion, Hypotheses 7, 8, 9, and 10 were not confirmed.

Results of both studies showed that ASCS was directly linked to well-being and mental health, but not to physical health.

Moreover, the mediation analyses showed significant indirect effects of emotional exhaustion on the links between ASCS, wellbeing and physical health. The results regarding ASCS and mental health were inconsistent (Tables 3, 4).

# GENERAL DISCUSSION

In this analysis, we investigated the links between the applicability of signature character strengths at study or work and well-being, mental and physical health. Burnout was taken into account as a possible mediator. In summary, we found ASCS to be positively related to well-being and health. Future longitudinal investigations may reveal whether ASCS could be relevant for burnout prevention interventions for medical students and resident physicians.

In this analysis, as expected, the more ASCS participants reported in their studies (Study 1) and work (Study 2), the higher their levels of well-being and mental health. We found significant indirect effects between ASCS and well-being through emotional exhaustion in both studies. In line with Peterson and Seligman (2004), physical health was significantly correlated with wellbeing. In contrast to their assumptions, we found no significant correlations with ASCS. Both samples showed an average physical health status with limited variance, which may explain these results. However, the assessed sample is a specific one. In the general population, with more heterogeneity and variance in physical health, different results may be found. Moreover, a significant indirect effect of emotional exhaustion was found on the link between physical health and ASCS in Study 2. The indirect effect of emotional exhaustion on the links between ASCS and physical health (both studies) were relatively weak, perhaps due to the relatively small variance of physical health in these specific samples.

The results were inconsistent regarding the significance of the indirect effect of emotional exhaustion on the link between ASCS and mental health. Whereas the link was clearly significant in Study 1, the effect was not significant in Study 2, albeit approaching nearly significance with a confidence interval near zero. This inconsistency seems to be mainly due to the smaller contribution of ASCS to emotional exhaustion in resident physicians than in medical students. Moreover, all indirect effects in Study 2 were relatively small. Other factors such as working conditions, stressors or other mental health restrictions may be more central for (the development of) burnout. Glaser et al. (2015) developed and analyzed a model including learning demands, resources, and stressors in the working context. Based on previous research and due to their study results they assume that ""challenging work tasks and learning requirements may be detrimental to health if this improvement is accompanied by work overload"" (p. 44). This may be an explanation for the differences in Studies 1 and 2.

In a further step, we compared the levels of well-being, ASCS, mental and physical health between the two samples across the studies to take into account differences between the study and work context. The results showed moderately higher means in ASCS and mental health for resident physicians compared to resident medical students, while all other variables were similar between both samples, with no statistically significant differences. Possible reasons for this could be differences in workflow or task related issues. Medical students may have lesser opportunities to use their character strengths during their studies (e.g., preparing for exams) compared to the resident physicians, who are working in their field of expertise. Further study designs should take these possible causes for the observed differences in well-being into account.

Harzer and Ruch have stated in 2013 that there is a lack of studies analyzing the specific role of character strengths in the context of work. In particular, they have recommended an investigation of specific jobs to look for the most appropriate character strengths and their application in the context of those jobs. We are not aware of any previous studies that have analyzed character strengths applicability in a sample of medical students and resident physicians, despite the particular risk for burnout, health problems, and reduced well-being for these groups in particular. Our research is a first step toward an understanding of whether fostering the application of character strengths may be a promising approach in medical education. Harzer and Ruch (2013) further emphasized the importance of opportunities to use one's individual character strengths at work in order to promote job satisfaction and engagement as well as productivity. Moreover, Gander et al. (2012) and Proyer et al. (2013) reported on positive correlates with healthier work-related behaviors and physical health, emphasizing the potential of character strengths interventions for health outcomes. In light of the predominant strains on medical students and practitioners, this is an important potential resource to consider. In light of this, it is especially important to investigate possible benefits of character strengths in the setting of medical education. Fostering ASCS as part of the education process may have positive effects on well-being, job (and presumably life) satisfaction, and work engagement. Peterson and Park (2006) described character strengths as a ""neglected but critically important resource for organizations."" Harzer and Ruch (2013) also stated that congruence between the character strengths of a person and work demands play an important role. That means it would be a sustainable win-win situation for both the person and the organization if the daily routine and the demands of medical study or later work as a (resident) physician were congruent with the respective individual's personal character strengths. Veenhoven (2008) even describes a direct possibility of influencing public health by strengthening individual lifeabilities. Teaching or learning character strengths could be a way of doing so.

## Limitations and Future Research

Limitations of the present study were the different sample sizes and the cross-sectional study design using samples from only one medical university and hospitals from one state and country. Further research might aim to examine the links found in this study in the general population, at different workplaces and

situations, or even in other life domains (e.g., private life: leisure time, in special relationships, on holidays). Another limitation was that some of the indirect effects found were relatively small or not significant. A replication of this study design may potentially strengthen results. For all mediations it has to be considered that the cross-sectional design does not allow for any causal interpretations.

Taking into account the described impact of ASCS, future research should address its potential of being a general predictor in longitudinal designs. Working climate or working conditions (e.g., stimulating job demands and resources) are potential influencing factors. In addition, the connection between ASCS and work-related well-being should be investigated in more detail: Are individuals with higher ASCS at work likely to feel competent and self-confident more often in fulfilling their individual needs and, consequently, is their generalized expectation of self-efficacy (Bandura, 1977) higher? Van Woerkom et al. (2016), for example, identified associations between strengths use and work engagement and self-efficacy of employees at work. Furthermore, in South Africa work engagement was found to be positively associated with perceived organizational support for strengths use (Botha and Mostert, 2014). Studies taking the application of character strengths in different cultures into account will be a strong enrichment for character strengths research. A very recent approach of Littman-Ovadia et al. (2016) showed that using signature strengths and using happiness strengths (hope, love, gratitude, curiosity, zest) both proved beneficial for different aspects of work. In contrast to the present study, signature strengths were associated with aspects of functioning at work (e.g., performance) but not with emotional-psychological aspects (e.g., work engagement) and vice versa for happiness strengths. The authors concluded that universal happiness strengths at work may evoke more positive emotions than using one's individual signature strengths at work. The effects of using signature strengths seem to be related to additional mechanisms, which could be even more central than positive emotions. Littman-Ovadia et al. (2016) stressed the potential benefits for individuals and organizations of using a variety of strengths in the working context. They further emphasized the importance of examining additional mechanisms connected with the effects of signature strengths use. They concluded that beyond the effects of signature strengths use, there may be an additional benefit to using one's lowest-ranked strengths, an aspect our study did not investigate. Future study designs may throw light on possible positive effects of applying one's signature strengths, other clusters of strengths, and using strengths in general in different contexts (e.g., Huber et al., 2017).

A preventative approach including the concept of character strengths could help enhance well-being and health, and reduce the risk of burnout, for medical students and people in the medical field. Future (research) efforts to improve medical curricula may include the identification of character strengths that generally tend to be useful in the context of medical education. As a result, it could be investigated how these strengths may be promoted in medical students from the outset. Moreover, creating an awareness of (signature)

character strengths (for the students themselves and for others) should be tested for its positive impact on students' wellbeing and mental health as well as work engagement and zest for their profession. Teaching and fostering individual character strengths (e.g., through strength workshops and strength-building activities) in the educational and the working context could be a first step toward implementing this research in practice. Fostering character strengths through changing working and studying conditions toward a positive institution may be expected to increase wellbeing and health across the entire institution. Moreover, the potential advantages of a fit between individual character strengths and workplaces involving or fostering personal resources should specifically become a stronger focus in future research.

### CONCLUSION

The results of these studies have the following implications:

Our analysis has shown that the ASCS is positively linked to well-being and mental health. Moreover, people who are able to use their signature character strengths at study or work are less likely to suffer from burnout (or vice versa).

Our findings underline the potential of fostering the ASCS. As a result we recommend the experimental testing of an implementation of character strengths training for people studying or working in the context of medical education. Future research should analyze possible improvements of medical curricula by including the concept of character strengths in order to enhance the well-being and health of medical students and people operating in the medical field.

Suicidality

### Abstract

Background: This study served as an initial investigation of the role hopelessness may play in the relationship between PTSD symptom change and suicide intent, among a trauma-exposed, treatment-seeking sample. We explored whether the effect of PTSD symptom change on self-

reported likelihood of a future suicide attempt (FSA) varies as a function of pre-treatment hopelessness, and whether reductions in hopelessness serve as a mechanism through which PTSD symptom change influences FSA likelihood.

Methods: Data was collected from participants (N=159) in a larger randomized clinical trial of a suicide risk-factor intervention. Self-report questionnaires assessed hopelessness, PTSD symptoms, depression symptoms, and FSA likelihood at pre-treatment and one-month follow-up.

Results: Pre-treatment hopelessness emerged as a significant moderator, such that overall PTSD symptom reductions were related to overall decreases in FSA likelihood among those at or above (but not those below) the sample mean of pre-treatment hopelessness. In a subsample of individuals who reported FSA likelihood >0 and elevated hopelessness at pre-treatment, overall pre-treatment-to-month-one reductions in hopelessness significantly mediated the relationship between overall PTSD symptom reductions and decreased FSA likelihood during this same time period, even after accounting for depression symptom changes.

Limitations: Data were limited to self-report measures (i.e., hopelessness, FSA likelihood). The intervention was not PTSD-specific. Mediation analyses were strictly statistical due to overlapping time-points.

Conclusions: This preliminary investigation suggests pre-treatment hopelessness may serve to identify trauma-exposed individuals for whom PTSD treatment would significantly reduce FSA likelihood. Moreover, reductions in FSA likelihood during treatment may be due in part to reduced hopelessness.

Suicide presents a significant public health problem, accounting for over 40,000 annual deaths in the United States (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2016). Suicide risk is demonstrably higher among individuals with a history of trauma exposure and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (Panagioti, Gooding, & Tarrier, 2009). Though psychological treatments reduce PTSD (e.g., Cognitive Processing Therapy [CPT]) and suicidality (Tarrier, Taylor, & Gooding, 2008) independently, a paucity of research has investigated the relationship between reductions in posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and suicidality throughout treatment, or factors which may influence these outcomes.

A comprehensive review of PTSD and suicide underscored the need for investigating psychological variables related to suicide risk, such as post-traumatic sequelae, so to appropriately identify and successfully treat those for whom suicide risk is elevated (Panagioti et al., 2009). Subsequent research suggests that PTSD-specific treatments effectively minimize suicide ideation via global PTSS reduction (Cox et al., 2016; Gradus, Suvak, Wisco, Marx, & Resick, 2013). However, it may be useful to consider concomitant psychological determinants by which PTSS reductions influence suicidality.

Hopelessness, often described as negative expectancies regarding one's prospects of symptom relief, is a potential mechanism through which PTSS change may influence suicidality. Hopelessness is a robust predictor of suicidal behavior (Beck, 1986; Beck, Brown, Berchick, Stewart, & Steer, 1990; Beck, Kovacs, & Weissman, 1975). Furthermore, hopelessness and suicidality are elevated among veterans with subthreshold PTSD compared to those with minimal PTSD symptoms (Jakupcak et al., 2011). Paramount to treating these conditions, initial evidence suggests hopelessness is a mechanism through which PTSS

reductions occur during treatment (Gallagher & Resick, 2012). Seemingly important, the degree to which hopelessness affects how PTSS reductions influence suicidality is poorly understood; this in spite of Beck postulating decades ago that, ""By focusing on reducing sources of a patient's hopelessness, the professional may be able to alleviate suicidal crises more effectively"" (Beck et al., 1975).

This study was an initial investigation of the role of hopelessness in determining how PTSS reductions affect self-reported likelihood of making a future suicide attempt among a trauma-exposed, treatment-seeking sample. Specifically, we explored whether the effect of PTSS reductions on future suicide attempt (FSA) likelihood varies as a function of pre-treatment hopelessness, and whether reductions in hopelessness serve as a mechanism through which PTSS reduction influences FSA likelihood. We hypothesized that PTSS reduction would influence FSA likelihood most among those high in pre-treatment hopelessness; and that, among those with elevated hopelessness and suicidality, reductions in hopelessness would partially account for the degree to which PTSS reductions affect FSA likelihood.

#### Methods

Individuals (N=376) in the Southeastern United States were assessed for eligibility for a larger randomized clinical trial (RCT). Of those eligible (N=303), the present analyses includes only participants randomized to one of three treatment arms, who reported trauma exposure during the baseline interview (N=195); 30.8% of these participants met diagnostic criteria for PTSD. Participants were primarily female (55.9%), 18-79 years old (M=36.94, SD=16.15). Ethnic composition was 59.0% Caucasian, 26.2% African American, 1.5% Asian/Pacific Islander, and 13.3% 'Other'.

The 21-item Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) assessed depression symptom severity (Beck, Steer, & Brown, 1996). Reliability was excellent at baseline (a=. 93) and followup (α=.95).

The PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C) assessed the past-month severity of the 17 DSM-IV PTSD symptoms (Weathers, Huska, & Keane, 1991). PCL-C reliability was excellent at baseline (a=. 94) and follow-up (a=. 95).

Self-reported likelihood of FSA was assessed using item four of the Suicide Behaviors Questionnaire Revised (SBQ-R) (Osman et al., 2001), which asked participants to rate how likely they would be to attempt suicide ""someday"" from 0-6 (never-very likely). This item was used in lieu of the full SBQ-R because the remaining questions index past suicidality without an established time-frame, which presumably provide little information about suicide risk changes throughout treatment. Baseline to month-one test-retest reliability for this item was calculated via partial correlation, controlling for treatment condition, and baseline-to-month-one PCL-C, BHS, and BDI-II change; which was deemed questionable (r=.67).

Hopelessness was assessed using a 3-item (items 8, 12, 14) version of the 20-item Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS) (Beck, Weissman, Lester, & Trexler, 1974). These items were included as required by the RCT's funding agency, from which data (Ringer et al., in press) indicate that the three-item version and full BHS are similarly correlated with the SBQ-R (z=1.29, p=.20) and PCL-C (z=1.62, p=.11). Reliability for the 3-item version was acceptable at baseline (a=.70) and follow-up (a=.68).

The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5-Research Version (SCID-5-RV) was administered by trained doctoral students to evaluate diagnostic status and trauma history at baseline (First, Williams, Karg, & Spitzer, 2015).

Participants completed an eligibility interview for a RCT of a computerized intervention targeting cognitive-affective risk factors for suicide. Participants were randomized to one of three intervention conditions; each involved three weekly, one-hour sessions. Condition one comprised a one-session cognitive AS treatment (CAST), and two sessions of an AS cognitive bias modification (CBM), as previously reported (Schmidt, Norr, Allan, Raines, & Capron, 2017). Condition two comprised a one-session intervention based in principles of cognitive behavioral therapy to address problematic ideas and behaviors central to depression, and two sessions of a positive CBM paradigm (Holmes, Mathews, Dalgleish, & Mackintosh, 2006). Condition three combined all components of the first and second conditions described above. Participants returned for a follow-up appointment one month after their last intervention appointment. Participants completed self-report questionnaires at baseline and month-one follow-up. All procedures were approved by the Florida State University Institutional Review Board.

### Data Analytic Strategy

Data was screened for missingness, skewness, kurtosis, and outliers. Outliers were trimmed to +/- twice the interquartile range from the median. To account for skew, SBQR item 4 was natural log transformed (1+original SBQ-R item-4 response), following previous procedures (Kimbrel et al., 2016). Among the study variables, 9.5% of data was missing, including 0.4% of baseline PCL-C scores and 20.8% of all follow-up measures. To account for missing data, multiple imputation by fully conditional specification was executed using SPSS version 22. Moderation and mediation analyses were conducted via the Process macro for SPSS, with 5,000 bootstrap resamples for mediation analyses.

The moderating effect of hopelessness on the relationship between baseline-to month-one PCL-C change and month-one SBQR item 4 was assessed, controlling for intervention condition and baseline BDI-II scores (accounting for depression symptoms, including suicidality [i.e., item 9]).

A statistical mediation model was conducted to test baseline-to-month-one hopelessness change as a mechanism through which baseline-to-month-one PTSS reductions mitigate monthone FSU likelihood. As evidence suggests scores >9 on the full BHS (i.e., endorsing half the items, or roughly similar to endorsing two of our three items) strongly predict FSA (Beck et al., 1990), this analysis was conducted in a subsample (N=69) who, at baseline: 1) FSA likelihood, and 2) scored ≥2 on the three-item BHS. Baseline-to-month-one BDI-II changes were included as a simultaneous mediator to test the specificity of hopelessness change as a mediator. The indirect effect of PTSS change on FSA likelihood through these mediators is considered significant if their respective 95% confidence interval does not include 0.

### ) Results

Full descriptive statistics and bivariate correlations for self-report symptom data are reported in Table 1. Bivariate correlations between treatment condition and all symptom measures were nonsignificant (p's > .25).

Moderation. The overall model was significant (F[5,189]=5.74, p<.001, r=.13). Baseline BDI-II (B=.004, SE=.001, p<.001), baseline BHS (B=.053, SE=.019, p<.01), and the PCL-C change by BHS interaction (B=.003, SE=.001, p=.02; Δr=.03) significantly predicted month-one SBQR item-4 FSA likelihood. Conditional effects of PCL-C change on month-one FSA likelihood were significant for individuals at (BHS=1.88; B=.001, p=.02) and +1 SD (BHS=3.00; B=.007, SE=.002, p<.01) of the BHS mean, but not -1 SD of the mean (BHS=.742;
B <-. 001, SE=. 002, p=. 95). PCL-C change (B=. 002, p=. 34) and intervention condition (B=. 014, SE=. 018, p=. 42) were non-significant predictors.

Statistical Mediation. The full model (Figure 1) accounted for a significant amount of variance in month-one FSA likelihood (r2=18; F[4.64]=3.61, p=.01). The effects of PTSS change on hopelessness change (a1) and depression change (a2) were significant. The effect of hopelessness change on month-one FSA likelihood (b1) was significant, but the effect of depression change on month-one FSA likelihood (b2) was not. The total effect of PTSS change on FSA likelihood (c) was significant, but the direct effect (c') was not. Indirect effects of PTSS change on month-one FSA likelihood through hopelessness change (B=.002, SE=.001, 95% C[.0001, . 0046]) were significant, but not through depression change (B=.001, SE=.001, 95% CI[-. 0010, .0032]). The partial effect of the control variable, condition, on FSA likelihood was not significant (B=.016, SE=.032, p=.62).

#### Discussion

This study investigated two ways in which hopelessness may impact the degree to which PTSS reductions following a brief suicide risk-factor intervention influence FSA likelihood. Though PTSS reductions were not correlated with FSA likelihood at month-one, moderation analyses revealed that, for individuals at or above the sample hopelessness mean, greater PTSS reductions were significantly related to lower FSA likelihood. As this was a relatively severe sample, mean BHS scores were roughly equivalent to the suggested cutoff indicative of risk for a FSA (Beck et al., 1990). Though, ostensibly, PTSS and suicidality may be more strongly related for individuals high in hopelessness, the association between PTSS reductions and lower likelihood of FSA is noteworthy; specifically, because these individuals are most at risk for

FSAs. Therefore, identifying trauma victims high in hopelessness is important given their risk for suicide, but also because treating PTSS offers subsequent benefits for reducing suicidality.

Moreover, among individuals high in hopelessness for whom baseline suicide risk was elevated, hopelessness changes significantly mediated the relationship between PTSS changes and FSA likelihood. This extends findings that hopelessness changes mediate the effect of CPT on PTSS, which were suggested to occur via indirect effects of CPT on cognitive schema associated with hopelessness (Gallagher & Resick, 2012). Though the intervention in this study differs from CPT (i.e., computerized, transdiagnostic, 3-session), a similar interpretation could be hypothesized. For instance, initial PTSS relief may reduce hopelessness regarding one's prospect of improved mental health, which in turn would render succide less desirable. Notably, changes in hopelessness significantly mediated the PTSS-suicide relationship, while change in depression did not. Though hopelessness is a common feature of PTSD and depression, it may operate as an independent mechanism through which suicide intent is reduced. With further replication and extension, this finding holds relevance for informing approaches to treatment for patients suffering comorbid PTSD and suicidality.

Several methodological limitations must be considered. The full BHS was unavailable in this data set, though initial evidence suggests the 3-item version is comparable to the constructs discussed in this investigation. FSA likelihood was indexed via a single, albeit validated, item, which presents issues of measurement error. In the interest of measuring self-reported FSA likelihood only, we make no claims as to whether these results extend to other behaviors (e.g., ideation, plans). During a limited follow-up period, hopelessness and PTSS were measured simultaneously, allowing tests of statistical mediation but not temporal mediation, which would better indicate the mechanistic function of hopelessness in PTSS reduction and suicidality. The

intervention conditions were not PTSD-specific. Further research should attempt to replicate these findings using PTSD-specific treatments, though the current data suggest multiple treatment formats may yield the observed effects. These results should also be extended to additional suicide behaviors (e.g., ideation, actual attempts), over increased follow-up duration.

These limitations notwithstanding, this study marks an initial investigation of the complex role hopelessness may play as a psychological determinant of the relationship between PTSS and suicide among trauma-exposed treatment-seekers. Critically, these findings point to the importance of identifying individuals with a trauma history and elevated hopelessness; if not because these two factors increase risk for suicide, but moreover, mitigating PTSS and hopelessness appear to influence likelihood of FSAs. Best practices for evidence-based PTSD treatments should be considered for those with comorbid suicide risk (Foa, Keane, Friedman, & Cohen, 2008). For patients whom degree of suicide intent may preclude initiating PTSD-specific treatment, this study suggests supplemental interventions may be useful for reducing suicide risk in conjunction with, and potentially through, hopelessness and PTSS.

Background. Most original studies and all meta-analyses conducted to date converge on the conclusion that patients with schizophrenia display rather generalized neurocognitive deficits. For the present study, we reopen this seemingly closed chapter and examine whether important influences, such as lack of motivation and negative attitudes towards cognitive assessment, result in poorer secondary neuropsychological performance.

Method. A sample of 50 patients with an established diagnosis of schizophrenia were tested for routine neurocognitive assessment and compared to 60 nonclinical volunteers. Before and after the assessment, subjective momentary influences were examined (e.g. motivation, concerns about assessment, fear about poor outcome) for their impact on performance using a new questionnaire called the Momentary Influences, Attitudes and Motivation Impact (MIAMI) on Cognitive Performance Scale.

Results. As expected, patients performed significantly worse than controls on all neurocognitive domains tested (large effect size, on average). However, patients also displayed more subjective momentary impairment, as well as more fears about the outcome and less motivation than controls. Mediation analyses indicated that these influences contributed to (secondary) poorer neurocognitive performance. Differences in neurocognitive scores shrank to a medium effect size, on average, when MIAMI scores were accounted for.

Conclusions. The data argue that performance on measures of neurocognition in schizophrenia are to a considerable extent due to secondary factors. Poor motivation, fears and moments distinguished patients from controls and these variables heavily impacted performance. Before concluding that neurocognitive deficits in psychiatric patients are present, clinicians should take these confounding influences into account. Although patients with schizophrenia achieved, on average, worse test scores than controls, a large subgroup displayed spared performance.

#### Introduction

Neurocognitive deficits, such as impairments of memory and attention, are neither core criteria for the diagnosis of schizophrenia (APA, 2013) nor pathognomonic (Moritz et al. 2001, 2002; Bora et al. 2009; Palmer et al. 2009). Yet, this research domain has attracted much interest since the times of Kraepelin (Kraepelin, 1899), who claimed that the disorder (then called dementia praecox) is characterized by neurocognitive decline ultimately manifesting as dementia. The vast majority of original studies, narrative reviews and meta-analyses arrive at the conclusion that patients with schizophrenia

have major neurocognitive deficits (Heinrichs & Zakzanis, 1998; Keefe et al. 1999; Reichenberg, 2010; Schaefer et al. 2013; Fatouros-Bergman et al. 2014). As a rule of thumb, deficits among individuals with schizophrenia are estimated to lie approximately 1 standard deviation below the norm. However, unlike Kraepelin's assumption, these deficits are rather stable and there is no evidence for progressive neurodegenerative decline subsequent to the first episode (Mesholam-Gately et al. 2009; Bora & Murray, 2014).

Neurocognitive deficits, which have been often detected in comparison to samples of demographically matched controls, are mainly attributed to the primary disorder (i.e. schizophrenia). They are hypothesized to act as a risk factor for psychosis, particularly the negative and/or disorganized syndrome, and a more severe course of illness (Brewer et al. 2006; Carlsson et al. 2006). Since the mid-1990s, a number of studies (Green, 1996; Green et al. 2000, 2004) have suggested that objective neurocognitive deficits, in conjunction

with (and sometimes overshadowed by) impairments in social cognition (Fett et al. 2011), predict poor functional outcome and may also compromise treatment outcome for some types of intervention (Kurtz, 2011). Consequently, efforts to develop trainings (Wykes et al. 2011; Cella et al. 2015) and medications (López-Muñoz & Alamo, 2011) that augment cognitive functioning (i.e. cognitive enhancers) are on the rise.

In this article, we will argue that the literature has neglected important influences that may contribute to neurocognitive test deficits, and thus, prohibit a fair comparison between patients and controls. These factors have only recently been addressed systematically (Fervaha et al. 2014; Strauss et al. 2015). For example, most patients with schizophrenia are prescribed medication, particularly antipsychotic agents, which - with the possible exception of clozapine - may induce Parkinsonian symptoms. Such symptoms will compromise performance in any motor test, such as the Trail Making Test (Fervaha et al. 2015), whether or not cognitive faculties are affected. Additionally, patients are also often given tranquilizers and anticholinergic drugs known to decrease memory and attention (Vinogradov et al. 2009). Although it is implicitly claimed that neurocognitive deficits (as manifestation of brain-related dysfunction) underlie negative symptoms (Hovington & Lepage, 2012), such as avolition and poor motivation, the causality may in fact be the reverse.

A number of studies suggest that patients with schizophrenia are less willing to engage to the best of their abilities (Fervaha et al. 2014), which makes it almost impossible to gain a true picture of their neurocognitive potential. Unlike psychophysiological or laboratory measures (e.g. blood tests), scores on neurocognitive tests heavily rely on the cooperation of the patient. In addition, patients may be distracted by rumination, unusual ideas and/or hallucinations during testing, which could direct attention away from the task at hand. Matching samples for age, gender and education is thus not fully sufficient. Finally, a restricted non-arousing hospital environment itself may lead to a decrement in performance, as has been shown in non-psychiatric populations (Wilson et al. 2012; Mathews et al. 2014). In patients with psychosis, the relationship between hospitalization and cognition is complex and perhaps mediated by more severe symptomatology (Harvey et al. 2013).

We have previously investigated secondary influences on neuropsychological functioning in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (Moritz et al. 2012), for whom neurocognitive deficits have also been described (Abramovitch et al. 2013; Shin et al. 2014) - albeit to a lesser degree than in individuals with schizophrenia. Poor motivation and checking compulsions were significantly associated with cognitive performance deficits. We concluded that while the study does not rule out that neurocognitive deficits may play a role in the formation of OCD symptoms, the reverse relationship should be considered as well. Likewise, another study found that in depression, cognitive deficits are also aggravated by motivational deficits (Scheurich et al. 2008).

In the present study, we examined whether the rationale of the aforementioned studies on OCD and depression can also be applied to patients with schizophrenia and compared a sizable sample of patients with schizophrenia to healthy controls. We assessed all individuals both before and after comprehensive neurocognitive testing with a newly developed selfreport scale aimed at uncovering several subjective influences on cognitive performance, including effort, motivation and other factors (i.e. concerns about assessment, fear about poor outcome, poor performance due to momentary influences). Assessing patients before the assessment was deemed important as postassessment data may be biased by tactical responses (e.g. a self-serving bias to blame poor performance on low motivation). We expected that patients would perform worse on neurocognitive tests than controls as a group but that differences would be (partially) mediated by other group differences, particularly on motivation and fears about the outcome of testing. While we expected that the nonclinical controls would be highly motivated to produce good results, we hypothesized that patients with schizophrenia would show less ambition.

#### Methods

The clinical sample was comprised of 50 inpatients consecutively referred to the clinical neuropsychology unit of the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at the University Medical Center in Hamburg-Eppendorf (Germany). All patients met diagnostic criteria for a schizophrenia spectrum disorder as verified by a psychiatrist. All patients were prescribed psychotropic medication, mainly atypical antipsychotics. The total score of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) (Overall & Gorham, 1962) was 41.29 (18.25), which corresponds to 'moderately ill' according to the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale (Leucht et al. 2005). On average, patients had 1.51 (1.13) prior inpatient admissions (range: 0-7). A group of 60 people served as nonclinical controls, for whom a psychiatric diagnosis had been excluded by means of a short psychiatric screening for mental disorders based on the MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview, which had been adapted to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) (APA, 2013) criteria by the authors (MINI) (Sheehan et al. 1998). Control participants were sought from various sources via word-of-mouth and advertisements. General exclusion criteria were major neurological disorders and age younger than 18 or older than 65 years.

All participants underwent a battery of neuropsychological tests, which took approximately 2-3 h depending on participants' speed and requests for breaks. Prior to the assessment and afterwards, participants were asked to complete a short questionnaire asking for subjective momentary attitudes, momentary impairments and motivation (see below).

Characteristics of patients and controls are presented in Table 1.

Participants completed the following battery of neurocognitive tasks:

#### Trail Making Test (TMT) (Reitan, 1992)

Psychomotor speed was assessed with the TMT Part A (adult version). The individual was asked to connect numbers in ascending order as quickly as possible. Part B assesses set-shifting and requires alternating between numbers and letters, again in ascending order. Age-adapted standard scores were applied (Tombaugh, 2004).

#### Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) (Heaton, 1981)

Participants completed a computerized version of the WCST (Loong, 1990), which followed the procedure of the original paper test. Participants were shown a maximum of 128 cards, which had to be matched according to three varying principles (i.e. number of items, color, shape). These matching principles were not disclosed to the individual. Via a tone (high v. low) and a corresponding verbal cue, it was indicated whether a match was correct or not. Categories completed and perseverative errors served as dependent variables.

#### Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT) (Lezak, 1995)

Memory and learning were assessed with the German version of the AVLT (Helmstaedter et al. 2001). A list of 15 words (List A) was read to the participants five times. After each trial, the individual had to repeat as many words as possible in no particular order. Afterwards, the individual had to memorize items from a separate inference list (List B). Following this, words from List A had to be recalled without renewed presentation. Thirty minutes later, the individual was asked to repeat words from List A only. The AVLT allows for the computation of several memory parameters (Lezak, 1995). Learning was indexed by the sum of correctly recalled words on Trials 1 to 5. The number of correctly reproduced words after the 30-min delay served as an

index for long-term memory. Normative scores for the German version of the task are available for different age ranges (Helmstaedter et al. 2001).

#### Selective attention Test d2 (Brickenkamp, 1962)

Test d2 is a letter cancellation test that taps selective attention. The individual had to cross out the letter d whenever it was presented with two small lines; d's with more or less than two lines, or any stimuli containing the character p, served as distracters. Following a practice trial, 14 rows containing target and distracter stimuli were presented. Participants had to complete each row within 20 s. The test is scored for errors and number of correctly crossed out stimuli within the allotted time. Normative scores for the parameter concentration performance (Konzentrationsleistung) served as the primary parameter. Age-adjusted normative scores were derived from a large population sample (Schmidt-Atzert, 2004).

## Divided attention subtest from the Test for Attentional Performance (TAP) (Zimmermann & Fimm, 1995)

For divided attention, participants had to perform two different tasks concurrently on a computer. The space bar had to be pressed whenever asterisks formed a rectangle on a 4 × 4 dot matrix (optical target), or whenever two tones of the same frequency were repeated (acoustic target). One hundred optical and 200 acoustic trials were presented. There were 16 targets for each modality. Norm values derived from a large sample of participants are available for median reaction times and number of omissions (Zimmermann & Fimm, 1995).

## Selective attention subtest (Go-Nogo) from the Test for Attentional Performance (TAP) (Zimmermann & Fimm, 1995)

Participants were presented with either an 'x' (target, 'go') or a '+' (distracter, 'nogo') in this simple computerized task of selective attention. A button had to be pressed whenever a target stimulus appeared. Norm scores are available for speed variables (Zimmermann & Fimm, 1995).

## Story Recall from the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS) - Revised Edition (Woodard & Axelrod, 1987)

Two short stories were read and the participant was asked to repeat as much of the story as they could remember immediately after the completion of each story. Thirty minutes later, participants were again asked to recall as much of the story as possible. No other tests of verbal memory were presented during

## then, a concrete, externally imposed strategy had to be followed).

## Similarities from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, 4th edition (Jacobs & Petermann, 2007; Wechsler, 2008)

In this verbal reasoning task, the individual has to deduce what two words have in common. Scoring followed the original manual. Scaled scores exist for a large German population (Jacobs & Petermann, 2007).

## Matrix Reasoning from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, 4th edition (Jacobs & Petermann, 2007; Wechsler, 2008)

The matrix subtest measures nonverbal reasoning. The individual is presented with a pattern sequence and must select the item that completes the sequence from five response choices. Scaled scores exist for a large German population.

## Zoo Test from the Behavioural Assessment of the Dysexecutive Syndrome (BADS) (Wilson et al. 2003)

The zoo test captures planning ability. The individual had to plan a route to visit six of 12 possible locations in a zoo. The test has two phases (i.e. first, a demanding situation with little external structure was given;

## Block Design from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale 4th edition (Jacobs & Petermann, 2007; Wechsler, 2008)

In this visuospatial performance test, participants must re-create two-dimensional patterns using colored blocks. Task demands become increasingly difficult over time. Scoring is made according to accuracy and time following instructions in the manual. Scaled scores exist for a large German population.

In keeping with prior studies, we expected no clear profile of impairment across domains. Therefore, we composed two new cognitive subscores, which aggregated either speed or performance variables, expressed as z-values, rather than proceeding with individual domains (if higher scores designated better performance, as in the memory tests, parameters were reversed).

## Assessment of subjective influences on cognitive performance

 Prior and subsequent to the cognitive assessment, participants received either the baseline or postassessment version of a questionnaire called the Momentary Influences, Attitudes and Motivation Impact (MIAMI) on Cognitive Performance Scale. Each version

consists of 18 items. The baseline version covers four domains 1: (1) poor motivation [e.g. 'I am not motivated at all to take part in the assessment.'; 'I am willing to do my best.' (reverse)], (2) concerns about the assessment [e.g. I experience the situation as very unpleasant and would like to leave.'; 'I know what I can expect from the assessment.' (reverse)] (3) fear about poor outcome [e.g. 'I worry that the tasks will be too difficult for me.'; 'In general, I feel confident before and after assessments. I am aware of my cognitive strengths and am able to show them.' (reverse)] (4) negative momentary influences [e.g. 'Right now, I feel very tired and exhausted.'; 'I feel fit and capable.' (reverse)]. Items were rated on a four-point Likert scale (1 - fully agree, 2 - rather agree, 3 - rather disagree, 4 - disagree). Scores were inverted for all subscales; higher scores designate more negative thoughts and feelings associated with the assessment.

Following the neuropsychological assessment, participants completed the post version of the MIAMI questionnaire, which again consisted of 18 items that were rated using the same Likert scale as before. The retrospective ratings measure the same domains albeit with different items: (1) poor motivation [e.g. I was not motivated and accordingly did not achieve my best performance.'; 'I pushed myself and gave my best.' (reverse)], (2) concerns about the assessment [e.g. I felt under pressure by the test situation.'; 'The testing situation was not as bad as I had expected.' (reverse)] (3) fear about poor outcome (e.g. 'I am fearful about the results.') (4) negative momentary influences [e.g. 'I had a headache during the assessment.'; 'I could sufficiently concentrate during the assessment' (reverse)]. Subscale scores were inverted; higher scores designate more negative thoughts and feelings associated with the assessment. In an unrelated study (Moritz et al. submitted) in 30 patients with OCD, the MIAMI total score modestly correlated (r = 0.42, p < 0.01) with an expert rating (the assessor was asked to determine the patient's motivation and distraction by symptoms among other indexes).

#### Strategy of data analysis

We first compared the two groups using t-tests for independent samples on all neurocognitive tasks. In order to assess whether momentary influences, assessment-related fears and concerns, as well as motivation, as tapped by the MIAMI scale, mediate group differences on neuropsychological functioning, we adopted a two-fold strategy. For the main analyses, we

calculated mediation analyses using Hayes' process procedure (model 4; 5000 bootstrap samples) with group as the independent variable (x), neuropsychological functioning as the dependent variable (y) and MIAMI total scores as the mediator (M). Analyses were run separately for the two neuropsychological indexes (speed, performance) and two MIAMI (pre, post) total scores. Second, we recalculated mean comparisons by entering MIAMI total scores (pre and post separately) as covariates to explore whether effect sizes would be attenuated substantially. Please note that the latter analyses are meant to aid in the interpretation of the mediation analyses and represent no proper test of whether the mediator/covariate exerts a significant effect.

#### Results

Both samples were very similar with respect to age, gender and education. Patients differed from controls on all MIAMI subscores and total scores, except for the motivation subscale at baseline. Cronbach's alphas for the MIAMI total score were 0.70 (baseline) and 0.78 (post). As expected, patients performed worse on most cognitive test parameters (16 out of 18 scores) relative to controls (see Table 2). On average, between groupeffect sizes were large (Ma=0.78). Almost two out of three patients (64%) performed at least one standard deviation below the mean on two or more tests (controls: 32%)2. When stricter criteria were applied (at least two standard deviations below the mean on two or more tests, for a critical discussion of thresholds see Abramovitch & Schweiger, 2015) the percentage dropped to 14% in patients v. 0% in controls.

As shown in Table 3, correlational analyses indicated significant associations between aggregated neuropsychological and MIAMI scores in 17 of 20 correlations (2 aggregated neuropsychological scores x 2 (pre, post)×5 MIAMI (sub)scales); the average absolute correlation was r = 0.30. Only motivation prior to testing, as well as concerns about the assessment (post), were uncorrelated with neurocognitive functioning.

Figure 1 shows that, with the exception of mediation B (i.e. the effect of group on speed, mediator: MIAMI post), the significant total relationship between group and neurocognition was largely mediated by MIAMI total scores, as evidenced by a significant Sobel test (in addition, confidence intervals of the indirect effect did not cross zero), even though all direct effects remained significant. Results remained unchanged when the subscale Negative Momentary Influences was removed from the total score, as one may argue that this subscale may partly reflect the subjective perception of one's actual cognitive impairment.

The result of the mediation analysis was corroborated by the ANCOVA analyses displayed in the last columns of Table 2, showing that effect sizes decreased substantially if MIAMI scores were accounted for (for ANCOVAs using the MIAMI baseline score, the average effect size dropped to d = 0.53, for the post version it was d = 0.51; uncorrected average effect size: d = 0.78, see above). The uncorrected group comparisons yielded twelve large (d > 0.8) and 5 medium effects (d > 0.5; 18 subscores and 2 aggregated scores). When the MIAMI baseline total score was accounted for, only 3 comparisons showed large effects and 9 effects were in the medium range. For the MIAMI post score (i.e. retrospective assessment of the test situation), a similar picture emerged (i.e. 3 large effects, 10 medium effects).

## Discussion

At first glance, our results corroborate a plethora of studies suggesting that patient with schizophrenia have severe neurocognitive deficits (Heinrichs & Zakzanis, 1998; Keefe et al. 1999; Schaefer et al. 2013; Fatouros-Bergman et al. 2014). On average, we found large effect sizes indicating better neurocognitive performance among controls. However, upon closer inspection, some caution is warranted when interpreting these findings.

First, only a minority of patients in our study had neurocognitive abnormalities according to standard criteria (Abramovitch & Schweiger, 2015); 14% of patients scored at least two standard deviations below the mean on two or more tests. This rose to

64% if the threshold is set very liberally (at least one standard deviation below the norm on two or more tests). This result is clearly not novel or surprising. Clinicians trained in statistics know that group differences eclipse outliers to both ends of the performance distribution. Yet, when such findings are communicated to peers and the public, researchers often fail to highlight that results cannot be generalized to every single individual, thereby possibly increasing stigma and fears (e.g. about dementia). Of note, even Kraepelin (1899) described a substantial subgroup of patients who recovered without residual symptoms, casting doubt on his general claim about premature dementia, which continues to fuel the interest in cognitive impairment in schizophrenia.

Secondly, patients markedly differed from controls regarding their endorsements of subjective influences on cognitive performance before and after assessment, particularly regarding fears about the outcome of the test, distracting symptoms (e.g. headache, tiredness), and performance motivation3 (see also Fervaha et al. 2014). Indeed, as predicted, a number of these variables heavily impacted performance. If taken into account statistically, group differences in neurocognitive functioning were still detectable (= molehill) but not as huge (= mountain) as before - after correcting for subjective influences on cognitive performance, differences declined from large effects to medium. Differences in subjective influences on cognitive performance found before testing are especially meaningful, as these suggest that differences were real and not just ad-hoc explanations for poor performance. Again, while neurocognitive deficits were detectable among patients with schizophrenia, even if contextual factors are accounted for, this says little about individual performance. Momentary influences, negative attitudes and fear about the assessment may shift performance of an unimpaired participant to impaired or push poor performances in the range of one standard deviation below the norm to two standard deviations (which is often considered diagnostically relevant and may thus lead to additional diagnoses).

We argue that the investigation has a number of important implications. As researchers, we might need to adjust our language. While it is circumstantial to talk about 'a subgroup of patients' rather than patients (in general), the latter formulation enhances stigma as not all patients have neurocognitive deficits. In light of the high prevalence of depression, suicidal ideation and low self-esteem in those afflicted with schizophrenia, we must be careful not to insult patients when confronting them with test results or to induce further fears that may propagate self-stigma (e.g. giving a comorbid diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment), particularly when transient secondary

Fig. 1. Results from the mediation analyses using Hayes' process macro. Group status predicted MIAMI scores (=a) and these in turn predicted neuropsychological measures (=b). Except for analysis B, the indirect effect was significant (i.e. confidence intervals did not cross 0) indicating that momentary influences, concerns and fears as well as motivation (MAMI subscales) largely contribute to group differences (0 = healthy, 1 = patients) on test results.

influences, like medication and poor motivation cannot be ruled out. As shown, due to internal (e.g. poor motivation due to a self-fulfilling prophecy), external (e.g. medication) or symptom-related (e.g. rumination, voice-hearing that distracts the individual) factors, many patients do not achieve their best performance. We need to pay closer attention to these factors before making serious recommendations; for example, whether to further academic education or career decisions. As mentioned before, matching control samples for demographic variables is clearly not enough in this regard.

We would also like to highlight a number of limitations. First, results need to be replicated with larger samples and psychiatric control groups, for whom similar findings have been reported (Scheurich et al. 2008; Moritz et al. 2012). One may also object that our samples were equated for background characteristics, such as education, which is usually lower in patients than controls. We also excluded patients with dependence disorders or neurological problems, which are also frequently observed in patients with schizophrenia. We did this so that we could attribute any differences on cognitive test results to diagnostic

status and not to secondary factors other than MIAMI scores. This strategy may have contributed to a slight overestimation of patients' performance. Our results thus need replication in more severe samples. Second, motivation, attitudes and momentary symptoms were measured with self-report scales. Subjective poor performance may prompt a selfserving bias and a tendency to blame performance on context, motivation or other factors. Indeed, a tendency to externalize blame has been frequently observed in patients with psychosis (Bentall et al. 1994; Kinderman & Bentall, 1996). In order to minimize such biases, we administered the MIAMI questionnaire both before and after assessment. Subsequent trials may also try to collect objective data (e.g. number of yawns during assessment, psychophysiological recording) and explore the impact of specific symptoms (e.g. distraction due to voice-hearing, delusional preoccupations etc.). In addition, with the exception of one study (see methods section), the MIAMI scale has not been validated against other measures of motivation or performance anxiety. We could also not control for medication in our analysis as all patients were medicated; chlorpromazine equivalent or percentage of maximum dosage algorithms cannot fully address this problem (Strauss et al. 2015).

For the future, it seems important to examine if secondary impairments may also depend on how investigations are framed. For example, some investigators explicitly tell patients that tests are carried out to investigate impaired cognition, which is introduced as an important factor for the formation of the illness. Such information may elicit stereotype threat (Pennington et al. 2016), frustrate patients and impede their full engagement (Kit et al. 2008). Unfortunately, studies often report little information beyond which specific tests were administered. From studies with women and older people (Spencer et al. 1999), we already know that even subtle formulations (framing) that potentially trigger stigma can impair performance.

To conclude, bold claims that 'neurocognitive impairment is present in most, if not all, persons with schizophrenia' (Palmer et al. 2009) (p. 365) may need to be revised in light of our findings. We should refrain from monocausal inferences when low test scores are detected in patients. While brain-related deficits may undoubtedly play a vital role, they are not the only source of impairment.

Previous research has investigated ways to quantify visual information of a scene in terms of a visual processing hierarchy, i.e., making sense of visual environment by segmentation and integration of elementary sensory input. Guided by this research, studies have developed categories for low-level visual features (e.g., edges, colors), high-level visual features (scene-level entities that convey semantic information such as objects), and how models of those features predict aesthetic preference and naturalness. For example, in Kardan et al. (2015a), 52 participants provided aesthetic preference and naturalness ratings, which are used in the current study, for 307 images of mixed natural and urban content. Kardan et al. (2015a) then developed a model using low-level features to predict aesthetic preference and naturalness and could do so with high accuracy. What has yet to be explored is the ability of higher-level visual features (e.g., horizon line position relative to viewer, geometry of building distribution relative to visual access) to predict aesthetic preference and naturalness of scenes, and whether higher-level features mediate some of the association between the low-level features and aesthetic preference or naturalness. In this study we investigated these relationships and found that low- and high- level features explain 68.4% of the variance in aesthetic preference ratings and 88.7% of the variance in naturalness ratings. Additionally, several high-level features mediated the relationship between the low-level visual features and aaesthetic preference. In a multiple mediation analysis, the high-level feature mediators accounted for over 50% of the variance in predicting aesthetic preference. These results show that high-level visual features play a prominent role predicting aesthetic preference, but do not completely eliminate the predictive power of the low-level visual features. These strong predictors provide powerful insights for future research relating to landscape and urban design with the aim of maximizing subjective well-being, which could lead to improved health outcomes on a larger scale.

# INTRODUCTION

Previous research on affective and aesthetic responses to environments and visual has had an important role in advancing our understanding of human interactions with the natural environment (Kaplan et al., 1972; Ulrich, 1983; Staats et al., 2010; Kardan et al., 2015a). Extending those advancements adds to the understanding of beneficial effects natural environments have on

mood and cognitive performance (Berto, 2005; Berman et al., 2008; Kaplan and Berman, 2010; Dadvand et al., 2015), and health in a broad sense (for example empirical studies such as Ulrich, 1984; Cimprich and Ronis, 2003; Mitchell and Popham, 2008; Kardan et al., 2015b; see Hartig et al., 2014 for a review).

The restorative potential of nature has been theoretically and empirically linked with a strong affinity and aesthetic preference for natural environments (Wilson, 1984; Purcell et al., 2001; Van den Berg et al., 2003; Hartig and Staats, 2006; Han, 2010). Attention Restoration Theory (ART, Kaplan, 1995; Kaplan and Berman, 2010), along with other theories (Ulrich et al., 1991; Mayer et al., 2008; Valtchanov and Ellard, 2015), has been proposed to explain the relationship between nature and improved cognitive performance. For example, the Valtchanov and Ellard (2015) study showed, through measurements of eye movements and blink rates, that natural environments foster lower cognitive load than urban environments. One of the explanations provided by ART is that natural environments capture more bottom-up/involuntary attentional processes compared to urban environments, and that urban environments capture more top-down/directed attentional processes (Kaplan and Berman, 2010). ART hypothesizes that directed attention is required for executive functioning and self-control, thus, interactions with urban environments may worsen cognitive performance by taxing directed attention (Kaplan and Berman, 2010).

An important question then arises: what features constitute a perceived natural environment? If there are well-known benefits of natural environments on cognitive performances, mood and health outcomes, then understanding the features that constitute ""nature"" and make it preferable can be a powerful guide for informing research in landscape and urban design in order to subtly improve cognitive performances, mood and health outcomes on a large scale.

Berman et al. (2014) have approached the first part of this question (what constitutes nature) using computational techniques to decompose scenes into their low-level visual features (i.e., basic physical spatial and color features). In the Berman et al. (2014) study, participants rated images based on perceived naturalness, and found that several of the low-level visual features significantly correlated with naturalness ratings. In a related study, Kardan et al. (2015a) used the same 307 images as in the Berman et al. (2014) study and participants rated the images for preference. Kardan et al. (2015a) then used the low-level features as independent variables in a model predicting preference. Further, Kardan et al. (2015a) reported that naturalness variance of a scene that was not modeled by the low-level visual features, was highly associated with the aesthetic preference for the scene, suggesting that there could be higher level semantic content in natural scenes that make them more preferable compared to man-made scenes. These studies provided insight into the way scenes could be interpreted in terms of their low-level features and how those features may be used to make broader semantic judgments of naturalness and aesthetic preference.

Hunter and Askarinejad (2015) examined this idea from their design perspective, and took a multidisciplinary approach

to select higher-level semantic features representing a continuum of natural to manmade environmental scenes. These researchers appealed to theories from environmental psychology, evolution/ecology, and design/aesthetics, to derive 62 high-level such features. Broadly speaking, high-level visual features (Hunter and Askarinejad, 2015) are perceived objects that carry semantic information of a scene such as sky, water, building, etc. The features were selected based on their theorized applicability to the design of urban and green spaces to maximize aesthetic preference and cognitive restoration capacity of those spaces.

However, no research as of yet has examined whether these high-level features might also predict aesthetic preference and the perceived naturalness of scenes, or whether they mediate some of the association between the low-level features and aesthetic preference or perceived naturalness ratings. Relatedly, high-level features are composed of low-level visual information (that is, any image can be decomposed in terms of edge and color properties), and low-level features may also carry high-level semantic information about naturalness (Oliva and Torralba, 2006; Walther et al., 2009; Kotabe et al., 2016). By teasing apart the composition of images into low-level features and high-level features, and examining how these features explain variance in scene aesthetic preference and naturalness judgments, we aim to obtain useful insights related to the ways these features can be used to inform research on the design of urban environments and greenspaces.

# A Development of Previous Studies

The current analysis pulls principally from results and data presented in original papers by Kardan et al. (2015a) and Hunter and Askarinejad (2015). The Kardan et al. (2015a) research focused on low-level features (as originally defined by Berman et al., 2014), where, in an experimental setting, 52 research participants (26 female, mean age = 21.1) provided aesthetic preference ratings, using a 7-point rating scale for 307 images (naturalness ratings were similarly obtained from Berman et al., 2014). Participant aesthetic preference ratings were then modeled using low-level visual features as predictors. It is important to note that in the current study, data from 260 of the original 307 images were used; 47 images were excluded because they were vintage or presented in portrait (vs. landscape) orientation. The Hunter and Askarinejad (2015) research focused on taking a theoretically driven approach to defining high-level semantic features. They did not, however, use these features to predict aesthetic preference and naturalness judgments. As such, these researchers provide a useful toolkit for operationalizing highlevel sematic features, and in this study, we use those features to predict aesthetic preference and naturalness judgments for the first time.

# Low-Level Visual Features

Research from Berman et al. (2014) quantified 10 low-level visual features of environmental scene images. These low-level features included spatial characteristics such as edge density, straightedge density and entropy, and color characteristics such as hue,

saturation, and brightness. Table 1 shows a complete list of these low-level features.

Berman et al. (2014) calculated the color features using MATLAB's image processing toolbox's built-in functions (MATLAB and Image Processing Toolbox Release 2012b, The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, Massachusetts, United States). Hue (dominant wave length in the image), saturation (ratio of hue to other wavelengths in the image), and brightness (an image's color intensity-visibly, it is the amount of darkness/lightness in an image) were calculated per pixel in each image, and those values were then averaged for each image to determine the image's average hue, saturation and brightness, respectively. Based on the same pixel values, the standard deviations for each color feature (SDhue, SDsaturation, SDbrightness) were also calculated, which quantified the amount of diversity of those features in each image.

For edge detection, Berman et al. (2014) used MATLAB's built-in ""edge"" function set to ""canny."" Canny edge detection uses a five-stage algorithm (Canny, 1986) to filter noise and track strong and weak edges. The edge density ratio was calculated as the ratio of edge pixels to total pixels for each image. The pixels belonging to long straight edges were then distinguished from other edge pixels to quantify straight edge density, as well as the ratio of the non-straight edges to total edge content which was labeled as the disorganized edge ratio of each image (see Berman et al., 2014 for more details). Finally, gray-scale entropy was calculated from the histogram of gray-scale intensity values across 256 bins; the more uniform an image's grayscale distribution, the greater its entropy.

Using the Berman et al. (2014) low-level feature algorithms, 307 images were decomposed by Kardan et al. (2015a). Figure 1 shows an example of edge feature detection, which was then quantified, and also shows an example of the decomposition of an image based on color saturation. Kardan et al. (2015a) then conducted a study in which these images were rated for aesthetic preference by participants using a 7-point Likert scale and the ratings were modeled using the low-level features as predictors.

### High-Level Visual Features

Hunter and Askarinejad (2015) translational work reviewed scene preference predictions from 10 theories and identified 10 structure-content properties based on the investigated theories to predict scene preference. Supplementary Table 1 provides a breakdown of the investigated theories and the structure-content properties they embody that Hunter and Askarinejad (2015) theorized predict preference. Based on the 10 structure-content properties, the authors then derived 62 measurable high-level semantic features that can be used to predict scene aesthetic preference. See Supplementary Table 2 for a listing and definition of each of the 62 high-level features.

To provide some examples of the various high-level features, we provide brief descriptions of 6 of the 62 high-level features; these six were selected as meaningful examples because they turned out to be predictive of aesthetic preference and/or naturalness in our statistical models. Those features are: Scenography Type, Building Distribution, Water Expanse, Built Surfaces for Movement, Skyline Geometry, and Skyline Maximum Undulation. All but Skyline Maximum Undulation are nominal variables. Figure 2 shows the pictorial abstractions used to assist scoring of these six high-level features. The Scenography Type describes the proximity of a viewer to the landscape beyond in terms of its sculptural form and scene depth; its character states represent a change from a more to a less expansive view. Building Distribution signifies the configuration of buildings or building clusters as they influence a viewer's visual and physical access to what is beyond. Water Expanse is based on physical or visual access across a water body in terms of movement by foot and ability to see the water boundary (e.g., not crossable and water boundary is/is not in sight). Built Surfaces for Movement is defined by the physical configuration of the designated circulation system found in the scene; character states describe the ability of paths to direct and orient. Skyline Geometry categorizes the composite shape of a scene's skyline based on the type of forms included; for example, buildings can add sharp corners or straight lines to the skyline while trees can add curves or straight lines depending on the distance between viewer and skyline objects. Finally, Skyline Maximum Undulation quantifies the maximum amount of vertical shift in the skyline based on distance between the highest and lowest points of the skyline; it is reported as percentage of the vertical frame height.

In this study we combine the work of Kardan et al. (2015a) and Hunter and Askarinejad (2015) to investigate the ways different image feature types predict aesthetic preference and perceived naturalness in conjunction with each other. This question is timely and important, given the demonstrable salubrious effects of exposure to natural environments and that little is known about what feeds into naturalness perceptions in the first place.

# METHODS

## Image Scoring and Feature Selection

All of the low-level features from the Kardan et al. (2015a) study were used in the present research. One change was that for this analysis hue of pixels in an image were aggregated as a circular scale (circular mean and circular standard deviation; Circular Statistics Toolbox for MATLAB; see www.kyb.mpg.de/~berens/circStat.html), rather than linear,

![](_page_3_Figure_2.jpeg)

which is more appropriate for calculating statistics of directional values (See Kardan et al., 2016 for an example).

map of the sample image created from salient and faint edges of the image, detected using Canny edge detection.

The first major step in conducting our analysis was to score each image in terms of their high-level features. Some of the high-level features are defined as continuous variables, while others are defined as nominal variables (please refer to the Supplementary materials for descriptions of how each feature is defined and scored). In general, features operationalized as continuous variables were scored in terms of area or length, and measurements were made by creating overlay outlines in Photoshop with an interactive stylus pad; graphical data were then transferred to the Grasshopper plug-in for Rhinoceros 3D (a CAD application) to be processed by a program written for this analysis. To correct for different image sizes and shapes, data were interpreted in terms of percent of the image's total area, height or width, depending on which variable was involved. For the nominal features, images were visually evaluated by three trained scorers who worked independently and then compared results. Where discrepancies occurred, a 4th scorer was consulted followed by a group discussion for the final decision; the 4th scorer was used for 3% of the images. More details regarding other aspects of the scoring of high-level features can be found in Hunter and Askarinejad (2015). Eight high-level variables were excluded prior to analysis. Generally, these variables carried redundant information, were uninformative or were not applicable to our image set. The ""Nature"" and ""Manmade"" features were excluded from this analysis because these features are conglomerates of several other features and did not convey specific, meaningful semantic

information concerning the role of high-level semantic features. For example, the ""Nature"" variable is created by adding together: ""Non-veiling Vegetation"" + ""Sky Total"" + ""Water Total"" + ""Earth Total."" For the purposes of exploring high-level features, this type of conglomerate did not provide any unique information. Additionally, ""Circulation Boundary Type' was excluded because it includes nominal levels describing the edge condition of circular surfaces and can include multiple levels of the nominal variable simultaneously (that is, one scene image can have multiple values on this dimension). Relatedly, the ""Natural Phenomenon"" and ""Focal Objects"" variables were also excluded as they allow for free writing of an infinite number of natural phenomenon and focal objects. Lastly, ""Other"" features were removed for similar reasons, namely, since ""Other"" is undefined in the scoring mechanism so the results were uninterpretable. Accounting for these preliminary exclusions, 54 of 62 high-level features remained at the onset of the statistical analysis.

### Model Selection and Data Analysis

The purpose of our research was to investigate the ways low-level visual features relate to high-level visual features when predicting aesthetic preference as well as judged naturalness of the scene images. We conducted a new analysis of low-level features presented in the Kardan et al. (2015a) study incorporating the two changes mentioned previously: use of circular hue and omission of 47 images (recall these images were omitted for all analyses). Following that analysis we conducted similar analyses with only the high-level features to see how they predicted

![](_page_4_Figure_2.jpeg)

aesthetic preference and naturalness of the scenes. The reason for conducting analyses on just the high-level features without including the low-level features was to provide, for the first time, a set of analyses of high-level features analogous to those performed by Kardan et al. (2015a) on low-level features.

The high-level features were analyzed separately depending on whether or not they were scored as continuous or nominal variables. Those analyzed as continuous variables dealt primarily with the general semantic category of a scene, for example the percentage of total built surfaces, which quantified a general semantic category of how much building was present. The same can be said for sky, water, earth, and vegetation. In this way, we determined that the continuous variables represented by the high-level features could be thought of as measurements of a general semantic category en masse, and we placed them in linear models predicting aesthetic preference and naturalness.

In contrast, the high-level features scored as nominal variables breakdown these mass semantic categories into features of their design. For example, the Water Form nominal variable contains four levels within the general semantic category of water, but the nominal levels are particular to the design layout of water in the image and not to a continuum percentage measurement (Level 1 = installed water with engineered edges and a stylized aesthetic; Level 2 = installed water with engineered edges and a natural aesthetic; Level 3 = natural water body with engineered edges; Level 4 = natural water body with natural edges). All of the nominal variables were placed into general linear models (GLMs) predicting aesthetic preference and naturalness.

We then modeled aesthetic preference and naturalness using both low-level and high-level features (continuous and nominal variables) together in a general linear model, and also developed mediation models demonstrating the ways high-level features mediate low-level features in predicting aesthetic preference (see Figure 3 for a summary of the 3 analyses).

During these analyses, we excluded variables to reduce the number of modeled predictors. Continuous variables were excluded using stepwise regression models, and variables entered into the GLMs that did not make significant contributions (p < 0.05) to the modeled variance of either dependent measure were excluded, and the GLM was re-computed until all predictors were significant. Of the total 72 low- and high-level features, 62 features were excluded from final aesthetic preference model, and 63 from the naturalness model.

Lastly, we investigated whether the high-level features mediated some or all of the effect of the low-level visual features when predicting aesthetic preference/naturalness of the scenes. Taking a hierarchical perspective of visual perception, low-level visual features have primacy in visual processing of a scene, which determines directionality of our mediation model; namely, the investigated mediators are high-level visual features, and not low-level visual features. From this perspective, note that highlevel features are composed of low-level visual features; edges and colors are the basic components of a scene, and through grouping

![](_page_5_Figure_7.jpeg)

and segmentation, one can localize and identify high-level features. Several seminal models of visual perception propose such a sequence (e.g., Treisman and Gelade, 1980; Marr, 1982; Biederman, 1987), thus justifying the use of low-level visual features as the independent variable in our mediation models.

To begin our investigation, we correlated low-level features with aesthetic preference/naturalness, and selected those with a high association (R4 of at least 2%, see Cohen et al., 2013) with aesthetic preference/naturalness to investigate whether their effects were mediated by the high-level features (Figure 4A). Next, to select our mediators we correlated high-level features with aesthetic preference/naturalness and those with an R4 of at least 2% or above were selected as mediators. The selected variables were then placed into several simple mediation models (using PROCESS Macro v2.15 for SPSS, see Hayes, 2013 for a description) for each combination of low-level feature as predictor and high-level teature as mediator (see Figure 4B for a pictorial representation). In a final analysis, we also computed multiple mediation models for each selected low-level visual feature with all selected high-level features as mediators (as shown in Figure 4C).

As a supplementary inspection, we also looked at the highlevel features that remained in our final model and computed one-way ANOVAs for matched pairs of continuous and nominal semantic variables (e.g., amount of ""Water Total"" across the nominal variable ""Water Form""). This analysis allowed us to see, for example, if there were differences in mean ""Water Total"" (i.e., a continuous variable) across levels of the ""Water Form"" nominal variable, to gain more understanding of representation of these

variables within this set of images. Results from the one-way ANOVA and plots can be found in Supplementary Figure 1.

### RESULTS

## Continuous Predictors: Low-Level and High-Level Features

All ten low-level features (see Table 1) were placed into a stepwise linear model predicting aesthetic preference and naturalness, resulting in Radj = 0.284, F(5, 254) = 21.593, P < 0.0001 for naturalness, and R2aj; = 0.410, F(8, 251) = 23.544, P < 0.0001 for aesthetic preference. The continuous high-level features explained more variance in aesthetic preference and naturalness, Radj = 0.529, F(7,252) = 16.963, P < 0.0001 for aesthetic preference and Raj; = 0.843, F(10, 249) = 139.843, P < 0.0001 for naturalness.

From the stepwise analysis, 5 of 10 low-level features and 7 of 26 high-level features remained in the model predicting aesthetic preference and 8 of 10 low-level features and 10 of 26 high-level features remained in the model when predicting naturalness. See Tables 2-5 for details of each model. High-level features explained more of the variance in naturalness than the lowlevel features in this analysis, which may not be too surprising considering that the high-level semantics are composed of the low-level visual features (the mediation analyses described later quantify this relationship in finer detail).

As a final investigation of the continuous variables, we placed all remaining low-level features and high-level features in a stepwise regression resulting in Radj = 0.596, F(9, 250) = 43.507, P < 0.0001 for aesthetic preference, and Radi = 0.853, F(12, 247) = 126.578, P < 0.0001 for naturalness. To note, from Tables 6, 7 (for both models) features involving building take on negative coefficient values, and features involving water take on positive coefficient values. These values demonstrate, that for increases of both preference and naturalness ratings, the amount of building decreases and the amount of water increases, which is consistent with what we might expect from the previously cited literature on preferences for natural versus urban environments.

### Nominal Predictors: Design Categories

Due to their stronger affiliation as design features rather than general semantic features, the nominal predictors are not as intuitive to understand as the continuous high-level semantic predictors, because each level of the nominal variables is representative of a different characteristic feature that do not operate on a continuum. For example, one level of the Water Expanse feature represents water features such as streams that are crossable and means of crossing them are visible in the image, versus a different level of Water Expanse that represents water features such as un-crossable bodies of water with no visible end, such as a large lake or ocean. Thus, to get a sense of how each nominal variable predicts aesthetic preference and naturalness, we ran separate general linear models for each nominal variable as a predictor for preference and naturalness. The results are shown in Supplementary Table 3. In sum, of the 27 nominal variables, when modeled individually, 21 significantly predicted aesthetic preference (p < 0.05) and 20 significantly predicted naturalness (p < 0.05). Notably, 8 variables that individually predicted aesthetic preference and 9 for naturalness have an Radi > 0.3. An impressive example of the predictive power of these nominal variables is that 65% of the variance in naturalness was explained by the Habitat Type Contextual variable alone (refer to Supplementary Table 2 for feature descriptions). These data led us to understand that despite the effective modeling of the continuous high-level features that are affiliated with general semantic information (e.g., amount of sky, water, earth, vegetation, or buildings), the nominal high-level features affiliated with more design qualities of a scene more strongly predict aesthetic preference and naturalness.

After placing all of the nominal variables in a general model to predict aesthetic preference and naturalness and reducing the model to only include significant contributors, 6 variables in the aesthetic preference model and 7 variables in the naturalness model remained and resulted in Rog = 0.572 for aesthetic preference and 0.868 for naturalness, compared to the continuous high-level variables at Rad = 0.529 for naturalness and 0.843 for aesthetic preference (in all cases p < 0.0001). The nominal variables are carrying slightly more predictive power than the continuous variables. See Table 8 for a list of predictors that remained in each model and their associated statistics.

When we placed all remaining continuous and nominal variables together in models of aesthetic preference and naturalness, and reduced the number of modeled predictors by excluding non-significant variables, we produced a linear model for preference with an Rea; = 0.684, p < 0.0001 (10 variables

included) and for naturalness Ray = 0.887, p < 0.0001 (9 variables included). Table 9 provides a list of variables remaining in the model and their associated statistics.

The next area of interest was to investigate the levels within each modeled nominal variable that had the largest and smallest mean values of aesthetic preference and naturalness. Now that we had determined the significant predictors for aesthetic preference and naturalness, we could tease apart the levels within these variables to understand the different ways each level was reflected in the outcome ratings. In this way, we could look toward a broader question of the design features associated with the modeled global semantic predictor that have large and small mean ratings to inform green/urban space design research. Table 10 provides a summary of these results. In this table we report the levels within the modeled nominal variables that carry the highest and lowest mean ratings (of the images containing these features) for aesthetic preference and naturalness (notice that from Table 8, variables Habitat Type Contextual and Habitat Type Emulated were significant predictors of both preference and naturalness).

### Mediation Analysis

After conducting correlational analysis between the lowlevel features and aesthetic preference, the selected predictor variables for our mediation analysis were: brightness, saturation, hue, disorganized edge ratio, straight edge density, and SD saturation. The various high-level mediators can be found in Table 11, as well as results of effect sizes from the mediation models (note: no significant mediators were found for SD Saturation, so this feature was excluded from analysis). Please see Supplementary Table 4 for mediation results for Naturalness.

The total effect and direct effect results provide valuable information about the extent to which these low-level features are being mediated by the selected high-level features (see color coding in Table 11 indicating full and partial mediation, as well as suppression). Full mediation takes place when the direct effect of the predictor variable is no longer significant (confidence interval includes zero) with the introduction of the mediating variable, and partial mediation takes place when the direct effect of the predictor variable is still significant (nonzero confidence interval), but weakened when the mediator is introduced and the indirect effect is significant. Suppression occurs when the predictor variable becomes significantly stronger when the mediator is introduced in the model (MacKinnon et al., 2000). As Table 11 demonstrates, full mediation only takes place for Brightness and Straight Edge Density variables, Saturation is only partially mediated by the mediating variables, and the Built Structures Open feature mediates all of the tabled low-level features except Brightness.

highlights that there are different types of mediating relationships depending on which low-level visual features and high-level features are being modeled. To provide an example of how to interpret the total effect and direct effect values, see the multiple mediation results outlined in Table 11 for Disorganized Edge Ratio. For this multiple mediation, since the confidence interval for the direct effect (c' = 0.2703) includes zero [-0.4369, 0.9775], the predictor variable is non-significant, i.e., fully mediated. The indirect effect (1.8855, -0.2703 = 1.6152 [0.9313, 2.4490]) is significant, and fully explains the relationship between Disorganized Edge Ratio and aesthetic preference. Also, it is important to note that all standard deviation lowlevel features representing variance in a given feature (i.e., SD Hue, SD Saturation, and SD Brightness) are absent, along with Entropy and Total Edge Density, so not all of the low-level features were selected to be in mediation models for aesthetic preference.

# DISCUSSION

These results reveal that semantic information in image scenes, and in particular semantic information carried by design qualities, strongly predicts aesthetic preference and naturalness for images of scenes with mixed urban and natural content. To this end, we began by demonstrating that high-level features are stronger predictors than low-level features in predicting aesthetic preference and naturalness. Then, we showed that when comparing the two groups of high-level visual features, design features are stronger predictors of aesthetic preference

and naturalness. Lastly, we showed that several of the effects of low-level visual features on aesthetic preference are mediated by high-level features, with evidence of full and partial mediation, as well as suppression. These results suggest that the role of low-level features in guiding aesthetic preference is complex and nuanced, with some low-level visual features affecting aesthetic preference through high-level semantics and other low-level visual features having more of a direct effect on aesthetic preference independent of higher-level semantics. As a general conclusion, we assert that not only is general semantic feature content important for predicting aesthetic preference and naturalness ratings, but also the semantic design formed by the featured content. As such, these modeled predictors should be used to inform greenspace and urban space design research.

In other words, ""water"" may be a large predictor, but the form of the water and its landscape layout and/or design is accounting for more of the modeled predictions. This may make sense given that these features have been designed for a purpose, and many times this purpose is to increase aesthetic preference. Knowledge of preferred design form (e.g., the type of form of a semantic feature such as water) can be a powerful tool for design researchers of green and urban spaces.

#### TABLE 10 | Nominal variables predicting aesthetic preference and naturalness.

Level descriptions identify highest in while and over integes containing the modeled nominal variable. NS means that the noninal predicts was not a significant predictor of the corresponding dependent variable in the previous analyses (Table 8)

preference ratings for each level of the Water Expanse feature. Note that as a single predictor, Water Expanse independently predicts 43.5% of the variance in preference and 44.1% of the variance in naturalness ratings. It is interesting, for example, that image 5D had a high naturalness rating despite having boats in view. This shows the power of the Water Expanse feature in predicting naturalness even if other aspects of the scene would predict otherwise.

Furthermore, in the model for aesthetic preference we note that only two high-level continuous variables remained, suggesting that within the high-level features, the nominal variables containing design and layout information of the scene are carrying the modeled prediction. It is very possible that the general semantic features (continuous variables) are being mediated by the nominal semantic features. Review of changes in the parameter estimates at each level of the nominal variables as independent predictors of aesthetic preference and naturalness provides some insight into how these variables may moderate or mediate relationships between the continuous variables and aesthetic preference and/or naturalness; but a larger study using images that represent a particular range of the high-level nominal variables would be needed to explore that relationship. Such analysis is outside the scope of the current investigation, as there is no particular feature we are interested in; the interest here is in the general relationship of all features. Accordingly, it is also important to note that the features that were excluded from our models may change according to the characteristics of a different set of images. Future studies informed by qualities of a particular feature or theme should investigate those particular interactions and mediations.

Interestingly, when reviewing the nominal variables that remained in the final models, certain levels within these variables stood out as being more or less preferred/natural, consistent with predictions made by Hunter and Askarinejad (2015). For example, as Table 10 demonstrates, Scenography Types that were bird's eye view of a landscape (level 1) were the most preferred for that feature, and Scenography Types foregrounded with vegetation that extends into the distance (level 5) were least preferred. This result is reminiscent of the savannah hypothesis, which predicts preference for savannah-like places with visibility for survival purposes (Orians and Heerwagen, 1992). For the Building Distribution variable, unsurprisingly, scenes with no buildings (level 0) were most preferred, and those with clusters of buildings were least preferred (levels 2 and 3), which we expect because natural spaces tend to be preferred over urban scenes (Kaplan et al., 1972; Ulrich, 1983; Kardan et al., 2015a; Valtchanov and Ellard, 2015). Similarly, the Built Surfaces for Movement variable demonstrated preference for no built surfaces (level 0) and the least preference for the presence of a network of paths (level 2), which contain various built pathways. Finally, Water Forms containing natural water and natural water boundary edges (level 4) were the most preferred, with more manmade structures being less preferred, and no water (level 0) being least preferred. Not only is this a demonstration of a preference for natural things, but in particular, a specific type of preference for water or perhaps hue.

As an example of how aesthetic preference for certain levels of the nominal variables may be applied to greenspace design research, we searched the image set to see the types of images with these features (from Table 10) that were more and less

preferred. Generally speaking (and without including manmade features, which are all least preferred), the more preferred images are of scenes that contain open views with a natural water body fully in view and a crisp horizon. Conversely, images that are less preferred do not contain water, have sharp skylines, and have views blocked by vegetation; these results are consistent with prospect-refuge theory (Appleton, 1996) which discusses a preference for natural elements that promote survival, such as access to water, and views for finding refuge and avoiding predation. Figure 6 shows, side by side, two images that contain these contrasting features. The images, left to right, have preference ratings of 6.068 and 4.330, respectively, on a 7-point scale. Note Figure 6A contains expansive water but the distant edge is in view, some vegetation, but substantial open space and a generally straight line horizon, compared to Figure 6B which contains low lying vegetation and taller, obstructive trees in the background, and no water. These features are well aligned with the levels that predict more/less aesthetic preference from our analysis, and provide meaningful guidance for greenspace design researchers. Furthermore, knowledge of the specific features that predict aesthetic preference and perceived naturalness can inform future research into applying Attention Restoration Theory, by investigating the relationship between these design features and cognitive restoration effects.

It is important to mention the prominence of the building features in this analysis, and their relation to the vegetation and earth features as those in which humans reside. It is noteworthy that in the final models for aesthetic preference and naturalness, all features dealing with ""vegetation"" and ""earth"" fell from the model; furthermore, features dealing with ""water,"" ""sky,"" and ""buildings"" seemed to be carrying the models. It would appear, and certainly in the case of naturalness ratings, that what is important is the presence or absence of buildings and their design orientation, rather than vegetation or earth semantics. Another way to view this interpretation is that for this image set, the absence of buildings entails the presence of vegetation and/or earth. To this end, it isn't the case that vegetation and earth features are unimportant; rather, their importance is encapsulated by the building features. This is an important message for future research in green/urban space design; that is,

![](0__page_13_Figure_2.jpeg)

building features (whether measuring the presence or absence of building) are shown in this study to drive the aesthetic preference model as it relates to features in which humans reside.

Additionally, we also speculate about the importance of the presence of water and sky semantic features rather than vegetation, and bring forward this discussion in light of literature by Kellert et al. (2011) that points to preferences people have to green and blue colors, and further delineate this preference with respect to an experimental study by Nutsford et al. (2016). Kellert et al. (2011), and other supporters of biophilia and related fields, discuss the positive feelings and relationship humans have with living systems, and by extension, with associated colors such as green and blue. In this vein, Nutsford et al. (2016) examined the relationship between psychological distress and green and blues spaces. These researchers used geospatial data to quantify these spaces, and then compared those data with health, crime and demographic data of the studied regions. In sum, they found that for a particular city, blue spaces (ocean) were associated with lower psychological distress, while greenspaces were not. Advancing the Nutsford et al. (2016) study, our findings support the importance of blue spaces in predicting aesthetic preference ratings, since water and sky (blue) features remained in the model and vegetation (green) features did not (note that earth semantics were eliminated first, in the analysis of continuous variables, and vegetation semantics were removed afterwards, in the final model of all variables). Relatedly, the hue variable also remained in the aesthetic preference model, demonstrating the importance of this variable. Indeed, as Table 4 shows (linear model using continuous variables to predict aesthetic preference), hue increases in the tabled model (standardized coefficient of 0.216). Since blue is further along on a hue color wheel, an interpretation of this standardized coefficient value could be that aesthetic preferences increase as hue becomes more blue. Importantly, our findings should not be misconstrued to diminish the positive effects of greenspaces. For example, numerous studies have found relationships between greenspaces and health and cognitive development outcomes (Mitchell and Popham, 2008; Dadvand et al., 2015; Kardan et al., 2015b); also note that the color green and greenspaces

are two different types of features (one low-level, another highlevel) and their effects shouldn't be conflated. All we report is support for the role of blue spaces as predictors of aesthetic preference, not that blue or green natural stimuli may foster more or less positive health outcomes. It could be the case that (as in the case described about building features) the vegetation features are encapsulated by the sky/water features, i.e., more sky implies less vegetation (r = - 0.375, p < 0.0001). Future studies should explore the relationship between preferences for blue and greenspaces, where those features are experimentally manipulated (and not correlated as in our dataset), as these can have large implications for landscape design research with the aim of enhancing health outcomes.

As Table 11 demonstrates, there are several cases of full mediation, and several more of partial mediation by the highlevel features, consistent with a hierarchical perspective on visual processing (e.g., Treisman and Gelade, 1980; Marr, 1982; Biederman, 1987), from which we expected high-level visual features to mediate low-level visual features. Of note, however, is that not all the low-level features are represented in Table 11, and there are also cases of suppression (i.e., low-level visual features relating stronger to aesthetic preference after accounting for mediating high-level semantic features). This suggests that some low-level visual features have stronger direct effects on aesthetic preference than others. For example, for color features we found that the effects of Brightness, Hue, and Saturation on aesthetic preference are mediated by high-level semantic features, but we did not observe such mediation for measures of variance on these features (SD Brightness, SD Hue, and SD Saturation). Regarding edge features, we observed that effects of Straight Edge Density and Disorganized Edge Ratio were mediated by high-level semantic features, but we did not observe mediation for Total Edge Density or Entropy. We speculate that what might be occurring is that some low-level visual features carry more information than others involved in aesthetic judgment; for example, by directly conveying semantic information involved in scene recognition in a parallel process to the hierarchical process (Oliva and Torralba, 2006; Kotabe et al., 2016). Thus, high-level semantic features would explain less of the total effect of these low-level visual features (those that did not make the mediation model) on aesthetic preference, because they are being processed in parallel with the hierarchical process. An interesting direction for future research would be to explore this parallel relationship further, and also identify moderating factors that make a given low-level visual feature have more or less of a direct effect on aesthetic preference. For example, it may depend on the degree to which a low-level visual feature has positive associations with higher-level features such as familiarity, warmth, and safety (Bar and Neta, 2006).

The preceding discussion should not diminish the role of the high-level features as mediators. Brightness, for example, is mediated by eight high-level variables, and when placed with those variables in a multiple mediation model to predict aesthetic preference; the change in R4 is 0.5037. Furthermore, the only mediations of vegetation features are as suppressors of Brightness. Thus, the effect of Brightness becomes stronger when vegetation features are entered into the model, so in this study there seems to be a certain mediating relationship between vegetation and Brightness, perhaps having to do with a particular shine versus dullness of the vegetation. Indeed, note that Brightness is fully mediated (direct effect = - 0.011 [-1.3605, 1.3385]) by the Skyline Vibrancy A variable, which measures canopy-sky interface created by vegetation (a method for measuring vibrancy of vegetation). It is possible that (sufficient) brightness supports the task of deciphering the added information presented by vegetation when reading a scene for resources and safety. This speculation is consistent with aspects of prospect-refuge theory discussed earlier (Appleton, 1996); brightness may help to decipher more details regarding the vegetation and whether it presents a safe or dangerous space. The interesting mediations and suppressions highlighted in this study, such as those between Brightness and Skyline Vibrancy A are a helpful starting point for future studies in the ways low-level features mediate high-level features. We recommend such studies make use of a more specific scene type, where mediators can be more acutely untangled (Hunter and Askarinejad, 2015).

There are a number of limitations in this study. As with other image studies, our interpretations are based on, and limited to interpretations of behavioral responses to static scenes. These results can only inform other research on actual experiences of an environment containing these features. However, we would

expect that even these scenes present an abstraction of an actual experience in these environments, that there would still be a strong correlation between experiences with these images and experiences with the actual environments that they were derived from. In addition, the analyses captured herein are specific to the image set examined. Although, the image set was carefully selected to represent a mixture of natural and manmade scenes, caution should be taken when applying or extrapolating this analysis to other studies. It would be important to replicate these results using a larger and more varied image set.

These data provide a general picture of the relationship between low- and high- level visual features in predicting preference and naturalness judgments. We have demonstrated that high-level features, and in particular high-level features carrying information about the design content of a scene, are stronger predictors of aesthetic preference and naturalness than the low-level features and much of the variance in predictability of the low-level visual features is mediated by the high-level features. Of course, much of this mediation is driven by the fact that high-level features are composed of low-level visual features. Yet, even with this strength of prediction, some lowlevel visual features remain independently predictive when taking into account higher-level semantic information. Taken together, by investigating the relationship of low- and high-level features in predicting aesthetic preference and naturalness, designers have a more robust tool set to inform research into landscape design.

Jane Pineda, Ph.D., AND Mark R. Dadds, Ph.D.

Objective: Family processes are a risk factor for suicide but few studies target this domain. We evaluated the effectiveness of a family intervention, the Resourceful Adolescent Parent Program (RAP-P) in reducing adolescent suicidal behavior and associated psychiatric symptoms. Method: A preliminary randomized controlled trial compared RAP-P plus Routine Care (RC) to RC only, in an outpatient psychiatric clinic for N = 48 suicidal adolescents and their parents. Key outcome measures of adolescent suicidality, psychiatric disability, and family functioning were completed at pre-treatment, 3-month, and 6-month follow-up. Results: RAP-P was associated with high recruitment and retention, greater improvement in family functioning, and greater reductions in adolescents' suicidal behavior and psychiatric disability, compared to RC alone. Benefits were maintained at follow-up with a strong overall effect size. Changes in adolescent's suicidality were largely mediated by changes in family functioning. Conclusion: The study provides preliminary evidence for the use of family-focused treatments for adolescent suicidal behavior in outpatient settings.

In Western countries are cause of de for example, it is the third leading cause of death for 10-19 year olds in the US2 and second in Australia. 3 Furthermore, self-harm in young people accounts for a significant proportion of presentations to emergency departments across most developed countries.3 Thus, the search for effective treatments for suicidal and self-harm behaviors in young people is an important goal for mental health research. A promising area of focus concerns the role of the family.

Family climate is an important consideration in suicide risk; family factors such as conflict and poor communication, loss of caregiver to separation or death, and psychopathology in first-degree relatives are risk factors for adolescent suicide; and adolescents' self-injurious behaviors are often precipitated by conflicts related to family relationships.47 Poor relationships with parents were shown to be more powerfully associated with suicidal ideation than peer relationships in a nationally representative sample of boys and girls

aged 12 to 13 years, and factors such as parental expressed emotion, that is, the extent to which parents express critical or hostile remarks and display emotional overinvolvement, is reliable predictor of patient relapse in young people with a range of mental disorders. 9

Given the mixed results associated with individual psychotherapy and medication for suicidal adolescents,10,11 treatment indications for suicidal adolescents are emphasising the systematic involvement of family members, and family-centered treatment programs such as Successful Negotiation Acting Positively,12 Dialectical Behavior Therapy-Adolescents,13 and Multisystemic Therapy14 have shown promising results.

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of family interventions targeting suicidal behavior in adolescents are sparse, however, making it difficult to draw clear conclusions about family treatments for suicidal behavior in youth. Harrington et al.15 evaluated a brief home-based intervention involving 162 adolescents (aged 10-16 years) who had deliberately poisoned themselves and had

been referred to child mental health teams located in 4 hospitals in Manchester, England. They did not find significant differences between a family intervention and control groups; however, routine care plus family intervention effectively reduced suicidal ideation in a post hoc subset of nondepressed adolescents at 6-month follow-up.

In contrast, Diamond et al.16 reported on 66 adolescents (aged 12-17 years) identified as suicidal in emergency and primary care departments with eligible parents/guardians recruited from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia who were randomly allocated to either Attachment-Based Family Therapy (ABFT) or Enhanced Usual Care (EUC) and received 3 months of treatment. ABFT (n = 35) was found to be significantly more effective than EUC (n = 31) in reducing suicidal ideation and depressive symptoms in adolescents, with large effect sizes of the order ES = 0.97. A subsequent analysis showed that changes in parenting behaviors and attachment mediated the positive improvements in adolescent suicidal ideation.17 This trial appears to have produced the most promising results so far and augurs well for the use of family treatment models for suicidal adolescents.

This study evaluated the benefits of combining a strengths-based family education program called Resourceful Adolescent Parent Program (RAP-P) with Routine Care, and comparing this to the Routine Care program (control group) for suicidal adolescents in an outpatient mental health setting. RAP was developed to build resilience and promote positive mental health in adolescents, and consists of 3 components aimed at the individual, family, and school levels: the RAP for Adolescents (RAP-A), RAP for parents (RAP-P), and RAP for teachers (RAP-T). RAP-P has been evaluated with parents of an adolescent school-based sample in an initial efficacy trial18 and a large multisite effectiveness trial.19 Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations indicate that parents find RAP-P to be valuable, and the intervention has clear potential in improving family climate in the context of adolescent mood problems.

We tested the effectiveness of RAP in reducing suicidality in adolescents. Following Diamond et al.16 we recruited suicidal adolescents from emergency and primary settings and randomized into RAP versus routine care. We hypothesized that RAP-P would be acceptable to parents indexed by high recruitment and retention rates, and that, compared to routine care, it would be associated with clinically significant improvements in the primary outcome measures of adolescent suicide-self harm risk and psychiatric impairment, and the secondary outcome of family adjustment. Finally, we tested a mediational model that changes in adolescent's suicideself harm risk would be attributable to changes in family function resulting from participation in RAP.

## METHOD

Participants included all eligible suicidal adolescents aged 12 to 17 years who presented to the emergency departments of 2 local hospitals, and to the government-funded community mental health service (BEAT) providing services for young people in the Blacktown-Mount Druitt Local Government Area (LGA) of Sydney, Australia, from March 2005 to the end of 2008. BEAT is a tertiary public community mental health service providing care to adolescents with severe mental health issues who live in this area of Western Sydney. The area is the second most disadvantaged LGA in the Greater Sydney Metropolitan area20; weekly income is below the poverty line for 38% of its population; 45% to 50% is public housing occupancy; ranked second highest in domestic assault incidents and child protection notifications,21 low education levels, high levels of drug and alcohol issues, and crime levels (especially juvenile crime) also characterize the area.

Adolescents were eligible if they met the following criteria: they were between 12 and 17 years of age; had engaged in at least 1 episode of suicidal behavior (includes suicidal ideation, intent, or attempt, deliberate self-inflicted injurious behavior) within the last 2 months before their referral to the local hospital/ health service using the Mental Health Outcomes and Assessment Tools (MH-OAT, see below); were residing with at least 1 parent (biological or adoptive); their primary diagnosis included any of the following: major depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, or anxiety disorder (based on DSM-IV classification) -; individuals with psychoses and developmental disorders were excluded. Suicidal behavior was conceptualized along a spectrum that included verbalized threats and thoughts of suicide (ideation or cognition), deliberate self-injurious behavior (e.g., cutting) and ""parasuicide"" or nonfatal suicidal behaviors. Deliberate self-injurious behavior was defined as any intentional self-inflicted injury, irrespective of the apparent purpose of the act.24 Participants who presented with poisoning from excessive use of recreational drugs were excluded. Parents were eligible if they met the following criteria: they were the primary caregiver of a suicidal adolescent; they had an average or above-average intellectual level; they had basic English language abilities; and they consented to the research and intervention.

BEAT mental health clinicians conducted the initial interview of adolescents using MH-OAT (see measures below) that includes comprehensive background data about the adolescent and family members including family psychiatric history and support network, strengths and risk factors; and wrote a summary indicating diagnosis (based on DSM-IV criteria),23 clinical formulation, and recommended treatment or management plan. Responses to this questionnaire were used to determine adolescent and parent eligibility criteria. The standardized questionnaire included a separate section designed to formally assess suicide risk. Young people who had a rating of medium to high in the suicide risk assessment section on the MH-OAT, and who had other comorbidities or identified risk issues (e.g., substance abuse, recent losses or relationship break-up, significant bullying experience, trauma issues, ongoing family difficulties, poor support network) were assessed against recruitment criteria.

The assessment of adolescents also involved gathering information from other sources (in addition to the family) such as school staff, general practitioners, pediatricians, and other agencies previously involved in the young person's care including sexual assault counseling, welfare or child protection services. Mental heath clinicians (from the Intake team) completed a triage form and a sociodemographic questionnaire for all adolescents who presented with suicidal or selfinjurious behavior.

#### Measures

The impact of the 2 intervention programs were evaluated for the primary outcome of adolescents' suicidal/self-harm symptoms and general psychological adjustment as rated by parents, adolescents, and clinicians, and secondary measures of family adjustment. To assess the reach and acceptability of the program, we also measured parents' attendance rate and satisfaction with the treatment program. Measures were completed at pretreatment stage (enrollment into the program), at 3-month follow-up, and at 6-month follow-up. If a family had 2 parents, they were both invited. Only 4 fathers attended, however, and so parental data refers to mothers throughout.

Primary outcomes were measured using adolescent reports on the Adolescent Suicide Questionnaire-Revised (ASQ-R), a standardized measure of suicidality.25 The ASQ is a short, self-report questionnaire of suicidal ideation, suicidal plans, suicidal threats, deliberate self-injury, and suicide attempts.25 It was developed and has been used largely with Australian secondary school students. Pearce and Martin (1994)25 collated items into a suicide index with moderate to high test-retest reliability (Phi coefficients for nominal data ranging from 0.59 to 0.91; Pearson r ranging from 0.58 to 0.89) over a 3-week interval. They found that a cut-off composite index score of 5 identified suicide attempters from nonattempters with 96% sensitivity

and 79% specificity, and that the tool showed sound internal consistency (α = 0.84). We used the ASQ-R as an ordinal scale to maximize its sensitivity to change during a brief treatment. Nine items are used to document suicide ideation, plans, threats, deliberate self-harm, and suicide attempts. Four items measured frequency (0 = never to 3 = all of the time), and 5 items measured recency (0 = never, 1 = in the last 12 months, to 3 = in the last month). These items were summed to form a total ASQ-R score for each adolescent at each time point (α = 0.74).

Adolescent and parental reports on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ)26 were used to measure emotional and behavioral adjustment. The SDQ is well established in measuring adolescent adjustment, and we used the total score to index overall adjustment. Alpha reliabilities for the current study were 0.77 for parental report and 0.84 for adolescents.

Clinicians completed the Health of the Nation Outcomes Scale for Children and Adolescents (HoN-OSCA). This is a standardized measure of mental health or disability, behavioral functioning, and social impairment in children and adolescents from the original Health of the Nation Outcomes Scale (HoNOS), developed by the Royal College of Psychiatrists to routinely measure outcomes for adults with mental illness.27 All clinicians receive standardized training via workshops, manuals, and video training. The measure contains 13 scales (0 = no problems to 4 = severe problems) covering all domains of psychiatric adjustment. A total score is produced by summing the scales and has a total score of 52. We used this total score index; reliability in this study was a = 0.89.

Secondary outcomes were measured using the Family Assessment Device (FAD), a well-established measure of family interactions that is based on the McMaster Model of Family Functioning.20 Total scores were used and alpha reliabilities for these were 0.94 for parent and 0.89 for adolescent reports.

Follow-up assessments using the HoNOSCA and overseeing the completion of adolescent and parental ratings were conducted by clinicians who had no involvement in the implementation of the treatment program and were blinded to the participants' treatment condition, as well as to the design, hypotheses, and objectives of the study.

#### Randomization and Treatment Process

Once eligibility criteria and informed consent were completed, families completed baseline assessment and were then randomly allocated to 1 of the 2 intervention groups: Routine Care plus RAP-P (treatment group); and Routine Care only (control group). Randomization was done on an individual basis by an intake officer, who was not involved in the study, using random binary number codes to ensure concealed allocation.

All routine care sessions were delivered in the BEAT outpatient clinic. Routine Care included any

intervention deemed necessary by the adolescent's treating team other than the family intervention program trialed in this study. This included combinations of crisis management, safety planning, individual psychoeducation, nonspecific counseling, supportive therapy, cognitive-behavior therapy, and pharmacological treatment. Family intervention during routine care was limited to crisis management and safety planning; no structured interventions took place. Participants in the RAP-P treatment group received all aspects of this Routine Care program, but parents were also invited to attend RAP-P. These sessions were delivered at the BEAT clinic or, at the family's discretion, in the home. The primary author (J.P.) is an accredited RAP facilitator and implemented the family intervention program, and BEAT mental health workers (psychologists, social workers, or registered nurses) who have worked with adolescents and families in a clinical setting for a minimum of 2 years, delivered the routine care program.

#### Family Intervention Program

RAP-P consisted of an interactive psychoeducation program for parents of adolescents implemented over four 2-hour sessions (held once a week or once every 2 weeks). The program was modified to add an initial or introductory session in which parents were provided information to enhance their understanding of suicidal or self-injurious behavior, practical strategies to help their adolescent avoid or minimize their self-injurious behavior, and information to facilitate access to appropriate support services. This session was specifically designed and piloted by the researcher before study implementation to make RAP appropriate to suicide issues. The remaining sessions used the RAP-P manual.29 Session 1 involved identification of existing parental strengths and identification and management of stress to enhance calm and effective parenting; session 2 provided information on normal adolescent development and strategies for promoting adolescent self-esteem and balancing independence and attachment issues; and session 3 included a provision of strategies to promote family harmony and to manage conflict. The program was implemented in a singlefamily format. Families were given the option to have their sessions held at the health center or at home. This was a strategy to promote adherence to the program; based on previous evidence suggesting that this group complies poorly with traditional hospital outpatient appointments and frequently fails to complete lengthy courses of treatment.30 More information on RAP-P is available online (http://www.rap.qut. edu.au/programs/rap-p.jsp).

#### Data Analyses and Power

Initial 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests (95% CI) established no significant differences between the drop-outs and completers on the sociodemographic variables and the severity of pretreatment symptoms

(as shown by all the outcome measures). It was concluded that drop-outs were due to random factors (noninformative reasons) with trivial impact on the responses of the final sample. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS 19.0. General linear mixed models (SPSS Mixed) analyses were used to examine the longitudinal effect of treatment group on outcome. This approach has many advantages over repeatedmeasures ANOVA, accounts for the correlation among repeated measurements on the same participants and effectively handles missing data and unbalanced designs.31 The data were analyzed according to intention-to-treat principle, using data for all participants who entered the study. Missing data were handled using full iterative maximum likelihood estimation of model parameters. The model also assumed fixed effects for all predictors and covariates, and an unstructured covariance matrix. This analysis is comparable to a multivariate ANOVA for repeated measures using complete data. 32 The 2-way interaction between treatment condition and time represents overall treatment outcome, as it tests whether there were any significant differences in treatment outcome at 6-month follow-up.

Using mixed-model ANOVA models with repeated measures correlations of r = 0.4, the sample size was sufficient to detect the effect size of Diamond et al.15 for 2 groups over 3 time points at y = .05 and power = 0.95 (G-Power v.3.1.5). One-way ANOVA and 2-way x2 tests (α = 0.05) showed that there were no statistically significant differences in sociodemographic or clinical measures between the 2 intervention groups at pretreatment that may have confounded the results.

### RESULTS

#### Flow of Participants

A total of 64 families were approached to participate in the trial, of which 48 (48 parents plus 48 adolescents) agreed to participate, yielding an uptake rate of 75%. Two families dropped out of the treatment group (RAP-P) and 6 dropped out of the control group (RC); this drop-out rate was not different across groups (x2[1] = 2.4, p > .1). Based on the remaining final sample of 40 families who completed the program, the overall retention rate for this study was 83.34% (or a drop-out rate of 16.66%). Figure 1 shows the attendance patterns through the different phases of the research trial and Table 1 shows demographic data for the final 2 groups after randomization. There was a 100% completion and return rate (100%) of follow-up measures by participants in the final sample.

TABLE 1 Sociodemographic Characteristics of the Final Treatment Groups Resourceful Adolescent Parent Program (RAP-P) and Routine Care

specifications in the facilitator's manual of RAP-P. The mean percentage of content areas completed by the RAP-P facilitator for Sessions 1 to 4 was 93.03%, 92.42%, 92.42%, and 91.82%, respectively. These values indicated minimal deviation from the manual's instructions and content areas by the RAP-P therapist. The plan to videotape sessions was abandoned after the first 5 families declined to give their consent; this was considered a major problem for successful program recruitment and retention.

Psychiatric Diagnoses and Suicidal Profiles

All adolescent participants met criteria for a primary diagnosis of Major Depression using the DSM-IV (fourth edition). There were 37.5% of clients who had at least 2 psychiatric diagnoses including anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and complex posttraumatic stress disorder-usually in the context of domestic violence or previous abuse experience. Of the final sample, 22% reported past sexual abuse experiences; 73% reported cutting, 65% reported overdosing, 22%
reported hanging, and 44% reported ""other risktaking behavior"" such as threatening to jump off a bridge, walking or running on railway tracks or oncoming traffic, and ingesting poison or cleaning agents. The majority reported that he/she tried more than 1 method of suicide or self-injurious behavior. Mean scores on the ASQ-R were 11.77 (SD = 3.87) and 12.22 (SD = 4.45) out of a total possible score of 27 at pretreatment for the RAP-P and RC groups, respectively.

Process Evaluation of Family Intervention Program (RAP-P)

Figure 1 shows that engagement in RAP was high and drop-out was minimal. Attendance at sessions was greater than 90%. Parents in RAP-P completed a brief self-report questionnaire at the end of each session and an overall program evaluation upon completion of the program (available from the authors). The immediate post-session evaluation form consisted of a 6-point Likert scale ranging from 1

Note: Error bars = 1 standard error of the mean.

(not interesting or unhelpful) to 6 (very interesting or helpful). High mean scores (5.45–5.68) indicated that mothers found all 4 RAP-P sessions to be very interesting and very helpful. The overall program evaluation completed by mothers after the last session of RAP-P consisted of a self-report survey with 9 questions using a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (never, no value, not at all, not at all useful) to 4 (all the time, great value, a great deal, very useful). High mean scores (3.09-3.86) indicated that parents found the overall program to be very useful and would strongly recommend the program to other families.

# Primary Outcomes: Effects of RAP-P on Adolescents' Suicidality and Mental Health

Mean ratings for primary outcomes at pretreatment, posttreatment, and follow-up are shown in Table 2. For adolescents' reports on the ASQ-R, there were main effects for time (F1,86.28 = 9.84, p < .001) and an interaction between time and group (F1,86.26 = 4.53, p < .05). Similarly, for adolescent reports on the SDQ-Total, there were main effects for time (F1,87,00 = 8.76, p < .005) and group (F1,74.13 = 4.17, p < .05) and an interaction between time and group (F1,87,14 = 6.28, p < . 05). Figure 2 indicates that the Routine Care group showed no improvement on these measures across the study, whereas the RAP-P treatment

group showed significant improvements from pre- to posttreatment and that the improvements continued through to follow-up. Parent reports on the SDQ-Total showed similar patterns: there were main effects for time (F1,87,45 = 23.76, p < .001) and group (F1,76.44 = 5.55, p < . 05) and an interaction between time and group (F1.87.29 = 15.38, p < . 01). Figure 2 shows these interactions.

For blinded clinician ratings on the HON-OSCA, there were main effects for time (F1,90.31 = 50.429, p < . 001) and an interaction between time and group (F1.89.70 = 7.95, p < . 01). Figure 2 shows that clinicians rated both groups as improving from pre- to posttreatment, and from posttreatment to follow-up. The RAP-P treatment group showed significantly greater improvements from pre- to posttreatment and through to follow-up.

# Secondary Outcomes: Effects of Type of Intervention on Family Functioning

Mean ratings for secondary outcomes at pretreatment, post-treatment, and follow-up are shown in Table 2. For parental reports of the FAD, there were main effects for time (F1,88.04 = 16.01, p < . 001) and group (F1.83.25 = 3.75, p = . 05) and an interaction between time and group (F1,87.77 = 13.47, p < . 001). For adolescent reports, there were main effects for time (F1,88,04 = 15.28,

p < . 001) and group (F1,83.25 = 5.36, p = . 02) and an interaction between time and group (F1,87.77) = 11.32, p < .001). Figure 3 indicates that the Routine Care group showed no improvement across the study, whereas the RAP-P treatment group showed significant improvements from pre- to posttreatment, and the improvements continued through to follow-up.

## Mediation of Treatment Effects

We hypothesized that treatment effects on adolescent suicidal behavior would be mediated by changes in family functioning stemming from participation in RAP-P. This was tested using classic Baron and Kenny33 models of regression in SPSS in which the following were observed: dummy coded treatment group was regressed onto adolescent suicidal scores at time 3 (c = direct effects); regression weights between treatment group and family functioning at time 3, and between family functioning and adolescent suicidality at time 3 (indirect effects); and the relationship between treatment and adolescent suicidality at time 3 was recalculated while controlling for indirect effects (c'). Figure 4 shows the results. Using parental report of family functioning (bottom half of figure), change in family functioning fully mediated changes in adolescent suicidality (c = - 0.406; c' = 0.172). Using

adolescent reports (top half of figure), participation in RAP led to significant improvements in family functioning (regression weight = - 0.474); however, this did not fully account for the improvements in suicidality (c = - 0.406; c' = -0.309). That is, both improvements in family functioning (regression weight = 0.205) and other nonspecific effects of RAP-P (regression weight = 0.309) show positive but nonsignificant relationships to improvements in suicidality.

## DISCUSSION

This study provides evidence that a structured, brief, family-focused intervention can improve family functioning and thus reduce adolescent suicidality and other psychiatric symptoms. These improvements were achieved via a 4-week intervention and were sustained at 6-month follow-up. This finding is consistent with the study by Diamond et al.16 that found positive benefits of brief structured interventions for suicidal youth identified in emergency and primary care settings and treated in outpatient settings.

The study achieved a reasonable recruitment rate (75%), an excellent overall participant retention rate (83.34%), and RAP-P parental attendance (92%), and high satisfaction ratings from parents, despite the challenges inherent in the socioeconomically disadvantaged clientele pool.

TABLE 2 Measures for Resourceful Adolescent Parent Program (RAP-P) and Routine Care Groups at Pre-Intervention, Post-Intervention, and Follow-up (Mean and SD)

ISQR = Adolescent Suicide Questionnaire Revised; FADP = Family Assessment Device (parent+rated); FADY = Family Assessment Device (youth-rated); HoNOSCA = Health of the Nation Outcomes Scale for Children and Addescents; SDQP = Strenghs and Difficulties Questionnaire (parent-rated); SDQY = Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (youth-rated).

In terms of the primary outcome, the intervention was associated with superior improvements in suicidality and psychological health in the adolescents. Second, as hypothesized, the intervention significantly improved family functioning. Although we would expect parents to report improvements because of their direct involvement in the program, the reports of improved family functioning by adolescents, who were not directly involved in the intervention, provides a more convincing test of the effects of the intervention.

We hypothesized that the changes in adolescent suicidality would be directly attributable to changes in family functioning; our mediational test of this provided mixed support. Using parental reports of family functioning, change in suicidality was fully attributable to the improvements in the family. Use of adolescent reports led to less clear conclusions; that is, the changes in suicidality associated with receipt of the RAP-P intervention were spread across changes in family functioning and other unidentifiable changes. The most likely candidate for the latter would be improvements in dyadic relationships between the mother and adolescent; however, we did not measure these, and further research is needed to test this

In terms of the clinical impact and significance of the intervention, the outcomes are consistent with Diamond et al., 16 who found that effect sizes associated with the targeted family intervention are large. The effect sizes that we found are likely to reflect a genuine advantage of RAP-P over routine care, but may be somewhat inflated by 2 other factors. First, although blinded clinicians perceived positive changes in

adolescent functioning associated with routine care, the comparison treatment had little positive effect on family adjustment, adolescent suicidality, or general psychological health as reported by parents and adolescents. This may exaggerate the benefits of RAP-P compared to situations in which routine care is more effective. Second, as with most studies of new treatments, initial results produced by the enthusiastic teams can be difficult to replicate, and effect sizes tend to reduce as other evaluations are conducted. Notwithstanding these points, the study adds to existing evidence that structured family-based interventions add significant value to routine care in the treatment of adolescent suicidality.

There are some noteworthy cautions that need to be addressed, given the limitations in the design of this study. First, although we took all suitable participants across a 4-year period in a large urban center, the sample size is smaller than optimal and should be followed up with a larger cross-site trial. Second, our inclusion criteria used a broad definition of ""suicidality"" that included the spectrum of ideators through to attempters, and it is possible that outcomes associated with the family intervention may differ across these groups. Third, the treatment intervention was conducted by 1 principal therapist. We tried to minimize any skill differences between groups by ensuring that routine care clinicians were similarly skilled and experienced; however, it is not possible to exclude the possibility that individual therapist characteristics may have influenced outcomes. Participants' refusal to have the sessions videotaped also meant that it was not possible for independent raters to conduct program integrity checks. The extent, types, and satisfaction with routine care were not measured, and so it is unknown whether it differed across RAP-P and RC groups. Finally, the families in the RAP-P condition received the intervention overand-above routine care and so time in therapy and attention received was not equal across groups. Although this is unlikely to explain the large benefits of RAP-P, or the specific mediation effects of family functioning that we found, future research could clarify the mechanisms of change by comparing the extra treatment to a credible control.

On a clinical note, there were several noteworthy features of RAP-P that made it suitable for this setting and clinical population. It is a brief intervention implemented in 4 sessions; its manualized sessions provided consistency and structure in implementation; the generic themes of family functioning were easy for participants to connect to their own experiences; and the program's interactive approach increased parent participation and allowed the clinician to take on a facilitator role. Furthermore, the single-family format, offered as center based or home based and with the choice of later appointments, kept family disruption to a minimum and was associated with high levels of engagement and treatment compliance (only 2 families dropped out). Finally, the strengths-based, nonblaming

approach used in RAP-P appeared to minimize any sense of confrontation with parents.

Given the grave and adverse consequences of lives lost because of youth suicide and the reluctance of many individuals to seek treatment, the results of this and previous trials speak to the value of involving family members in brief, structured therapy programs. Further investigation of these treatment and prevention programs that work is warranted. Given the emerging evidence for effectiveness, a next priority for research should be to test the extent to which these positive outcomes are durable and generalizable across clinicians and clinical settings. &

Executive function declines with age, but engaging in aerobic exercise may attenuate decline. One mechanism by which aerobic exercise may preserve executive function is through the up-regulation of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF), which also declines with age. The present study examined BDNF as a mediator of the effects of a 1-year walking intervention on executive function in 90 older adults (mean age = 66.82). Participants were randomized to a stretching and toning control group or a moderate intensity walking intervention group. BDNF serum levels and performance on a task-switching paradigm were collected at baseline and follow-up. We found that age moderated the effect of intervention group on changes in BDNF levels, with those in the highest age quartile showing the greatest increase in BDNF after 1-year of moderate intensity walking exercise (p = 0.036). The mediation analyses revealed that BDNF mediated the effect of the intervention on task-switch accuracy, but did so as a function of age, such that exercise-induced changes in BDNF mediated the effect of exercise on task-switch performance only for individuals over the age of 71. These results demonstrate that both age and BDNF serum levels are important factors to consider when investigating the mechanisms by which exercise interventions influence cognitive outcomes, particularly in elderly populations.

#### INTRODUCTION

Decline in processing speed, memory, and executive function is a relatively widespread characteristic of aging (Li et al., 2001; Bishop et al., 2010; Silver et al., 2011; El Haj and Allain, 2012; Singh-Manoux et al., 2012; Woodard et al., 2012). Several neural mechanisms thought to support these cognitive processes become particularly vulnerable during the aging process (Burke and Barnes, 2006). For instance, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels tend to decrease progressively with age (Lommatzsch et al., 2005; Ziegenhorn et al., 2007; Driscoll et al., 2012) and correlate with age-related reductions in hippocampal volume (Erickson et al., 2010a). BDNF facilitates neural repair (Yang et al., 2014), induces long-term potentiation (Diógenes et al., 2011), enhances learning and memory (Pang and Lu, 2004; Bekinschtein et al., 2014), and promotes synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis (Oliff et al., 1998; Lu, 2003; Vaynman et al., 2004). The beneficial effects of BDNF on brain health and cognition may be especially relevant for older adults, who are susceptible to physiological changes that interfere with neural processes and cognitive function. For instance, marked increases in blood pressure and inflammatory load occur in older adulthood, both of which have been independently linked to dementia risk and decline in cognitive function (Schmidt et al., 2002; Singh and Newman, 2011). Thus, there is an increased presence of

<sup>1</sup> Department of Psychology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA

factors that compromise cognitive function in older adults, with a contemporaneous decrease in known mechanisms that support advantageous brain and cognitive health. Therefore, efforts to increase BDNF, particularly in older aged individuals, could play an important role in the preservation of cognitive function.

Fortunately, exercise may be an effective approach to preserve and improve cognitive function and brain health in late adulthood. For example, randomized clinical trials have found that moderate-intensity exercise improves memory and executive function (Kramer et al., 1999a; Colcombe and Kramer, 2003; Smith et al., 2010) increases prefrontal cortex (Colcombe et al., 2006) and hippocampal volume (Erickson et al., 2011), and influences brain network connectivity (Voss et al., 2010a). Crosssectional and epidemiological studies have supported these results and demonstrate that higher fitness levels and greater amounts of physical activity are associated with greater gray matter volumes (Erickson et al., 2010b; Weinstein et al., 2012; Benedict et al., 2013), white matter integrity (Gow et al., 2012; Gons et al., 2013; Tian et al., 2014), reduced brain atrophy rates (Gow et al., 2012; Smith et al., 2014), and reduced risk of cognitive impairment and dementia (Podewils et al., 2005; Larson et al., 2006; Sofi et al., 2011). Yet, the mechanisms by which exercise improves or maintains brain health in humans remain poorly understood, but likely include changes in inflammation, insulin resistance, as well as central changes in serotonin, dopamine, or other neurotransmitters.

Increased expression of BDNF may be another mechanism by which exercise positively influences cognitive and brain function. For example, in rodents, exercise increases BDNF expression in the striatum (Marais et al., 2009), hippocampus (Aguiar et al., 2011), and cortex (Neeper et al., 1996) and an exercise-induced up-regulation of BDNF, along with its receptor tyrosine kinase (Li et al., 2008), mediates the effects of exercise on cognition (Gómez-Pinilla et al., 2002; Vaynman et al., 2004; Van Praag et al., 2005; Stranahan et al., 2009; Creer et al., 2010; Bechara and Kelly, 2013). Unfortunately in humans the effect of exercise on serum BDNF is more equivocal (Zoladz and Pilc, 2010). Acute bouts of exercise increase serum BDNF levels, which, in turn, are associated with improvements in cognitive performance (Knaepen et al., 2010; Ströhle et al., 2010; Heyman et al., 2012; Coelho et al., 2013). However, more chronic and longer-term exercise programs have not reliably demonstrated increases in BDNF levels (Baker et al., 2010; Erickson et al., 2011; Ruscheweyh et al., 2011). Despite these discouraging effects of exercise interventions, exercise-induced changes in hippocampal volume (Erickson et al., 2011) and brain connectivity (Voss et al., 2013) were correlated with percent change in serum BDNF levels. These findings suggest that serum BDNF levels may be an important biomarker for brain and cognitive health, but whether BDNF mediates the positive effects of exercise on cognitive performance remains a matter of speculation.

Here, we examine whether exercise-induced changes in serum BDNF mediates the effect of a randomized exercise intervention on executive function. Specifically, we assessed effects on task-switch performance, a cognitive task largely susceptible to age-related shifts in performance speed and accuracy (Salthouse et al., 1998; Kray and Lindenberger, 2000; Cepeda et al., 2001; Jimura and Braver, 2010; Gazes et al., 2012). This task is considered a measure of executive control and is supported primarily by the prefrontal and parietal cortices (Sohn et al., 2000; Braver et al., 2003; Aron et al., 2004; Gold et al., 2010), regions that experience preferential degeneration with advancing age (Sowell et al., 2003; Salat et al., 2005; Driscoll et al., 2009). Because BDNF levels decline with age (Lommatzsch et al., 2005; Burke and Barnes, 2006; Ziegenhorn et al., 2007), and is found in cortical regions that likely support task-switch performance (Podewils et al., 2005; Aguiar et al., 2011; Diógenes et al., 2011), we reasoned that age might be an important moderator of the effects of exercise on BDNF and task-switch performance.

Prior studies examining the effects of exercise on serum BDNF have used age as a covariate rather than modeling age as an interaction term. Yet, several studies and meta-analyses suggest that the positive effects of exercise on cognitive performance may be magnified at older ages (Etnier et al., 2007; Smith et al., 2010) while others have found that age-related losses in gray matter volume and n-acetylaspartate levels were mitigated by higher fitness levels (Colcombe et al., 2003; Erickson et al., 2012). These and other studies (Adlard et al., 2005; Knaepen et al., 2010) suggest that age might be moderating an effect of exercise on serum BDNF levels.

The current study examined the effects of a 12-month randomized exercise intervention on serum BDNF and taskswitching performance in older adults. We predicted that exercise-induced changes in serum BDNF would mediate the effects of the exercise intervention on task-switch performance. However, we also predicted that age would moderate the effect of the intervention on BDNF levels, such that the oldest adults in the exercise group would show greater increases in BDNF than their younger counterparts.

# METHOD

# PARTICIPANTS

One-hundred and seventy-nine participants were randomly assigned to either a walking exercise or stretching-toning control group prior to the start of the intervention. Of the 179 participants, 106 had complete blood data collected at baseline and post-intervention for BDNF assays. Additionally, 13 participants were missing BDNF genetic polymorphism data and were excluded from the analysis. We also excluded one participant who was ill at the time of blood draw. Our final sample in BDNF analyses consisted of 92 participants. There were an additional two individuals missing task-switching data (one from each group), so all analyses conducted with the task-switch data used a sample of 90 participants. Excluded participants did not differ in demographic characteristics or baseline fitness level from those included (p > 0.05). The sample and results from this intervention have been previously reported, where hippocampal volume (Erickson et al., 2011), brain connectivity (Voss et al., 2010a,b, 2013) white matter integrity and adherence to the intervention (McAuley et al., 2011) were examined. The analyses and results reported in the current study have not been previously examined, nor published.

Community-dwelling older adults were recruited from the local community of Urbana-Champaign, Illinois. Eligible participants had to (i) demonstrate strong right handedness (Oldfield, 1971), (ii) be between the ages of 55 and 80, (iii) score >51 on the modified Mini-Mental Status Examination (Stern et al., 1987), (Singh-Manoux et al., 2012), score <3 on the Geriatric Depression Scale to rule out possible depression (Yesavage and Sheikh, 1986), (v) have normal color vision, (vi) have a corrected visual acuity of at least 20/40, (vii) have no history of neurological diseases or infarcts, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, or stroke, (viii) have no history of major vasculature problems, including cardiovascular disease or diabetes, (ix) obtain consent from their personal physician, and (x) sign an informed consent form approved by the University of Illinois. In addition, all participants had to report being currently sedentary, which was defined as having been physically active for 30 min or more no more than two times in the last 6 months. Participants were compensated for their participation. The Institutional Review Board of the University of Illinois approved the study and all participants gave written informed consent prior to participating.

After completion of the initial blood draw, an MRI session (results not included here), and fitness assessment, participants were randomized to the aerobic walking group (n = 47) or to the stretching-toning control group (n = 45). Demographic information can be found in Table 1.

#### AEROBIC FITNESS ASSESSMENT

Maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) was used as an objective measure of baseline cardiorespiratory fitness. Participants were required to obtain consent from their personal physician before cardiorespiratory fitness testing was conducted. As detailed by Voss et al. (2010a) assessment of cardiorespiratory fitness was determined using graded maximum exercise testing on a motordriven treadmill with continuous monitoring of respiration, heart rate, and blood pressure by a cardiologist and nurse (Voss et al.,

Demographic information comparing the two intervention groups: walking intervention, stretching and toning control.

2010a, 2013). During the assessment, subjects walked at a speed slightly faster than their normal walking pace with increasing graded increments of 2% every 2 min. Oxygen uptake was measured at 30-s intervals until a max VO2 was attained or to the point of test termination due to exhaustion. VO2max was defined as the highest recorded VO2 value when two of three criteria were satisfied: (1) a plateau in VO2 peak between two or more workloads, (2) a respiratory exchange ratio >1.00, or (3) a heart rate equivalent to their age predicted maximum (i.e., 220-age). VO2max scores are expressed in units of milliliters per kilogram per minute (ml/kg/min), after controlling for height and weight of the individual.

#### TRAINING PROTOCOL

#### Aerobic exercise condition

For the aerobic exercise program, a trained exercise leader supervised all sessions. As described by McAuley et al. (2011) and Erickson et al. (2011), participants started by walking for 10 min and increased walking duration weekly by 5-min increments until a duration of 40 min was achieved at week 7. Participants walked for 40 min per session for the remainder of the program. All walking sessions started and ended with approximately 5 min of stretching for the purpose of warming up and cooling down. Participants wore heart rate monitors and were encouraged to walk in their target heart rate zone, which was calculated using the Karvonen method (Strath et al., 2000) according to the resting and maximum heart rates achieved during the baseline maximal graded exercise test. The target heart rate zone was 50-60% of the maximum heart rate reserve for weeks 1-7 and 60-75% for the remainder of the program. Participants in the walking group completed an exercise log at each exercise session. Every 4 weeks, participants received written feedback forms that summarized the data from their logs. Participants with low attendance and/or a low exercise heart rate were encouraged to improve their performance in the following month.

#### Stretching and toning control condition

For the stretching and toning control program, all sessions were led and monitored by trained exercise leaders. All classes started and ended with warm-up and cool-down stretching. During each class, participants engaged in four muscle-toning exercises using dumbbells or resistance bands, two exercises designed to improve balance, one yoga sequence, and one exercise of their choice. To maintain interest, a new group of exercises was introduced every 3 week. During the first weeks, participants focused on becoming familiar with the new exercises, and during the second and third weeks they were encouraged to increase the intensity by using more weight or adding more repetitions. Participants in the stretching and toning control group also completed exercise logs at each exercise session and received monthly feedback forms. They were encouraged to exercise at an approximate intensity of 13-15 on the Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion scale (Borg, 1985) and to attend as many classes as possible.

#### SERUM BDNF ASSAY

 Blood was collected at baseline before the intervention and again immediately after the completion of the program. Blood sampling

for BDNF analysis was performed approximately 1 week before the cognitive testing session. Fasted subjects reported to the laboratory at 0600-0800 h, at which time blood from the antecubital vein was collected in serum separator tubes (Becton Dickinson). The blood samples were kept at room temperature for 15 min to allow for clotting, after which the samples were centrifuged at 1100 × g at 4°C for 15 min. Serum was then harvested, aliquoted, and stored at -80°C until analysis. Serum BDNF was quantified using an enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (Human BDNF Quantikine Immunoassay, DBD00, R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

## BDNF GENOTYPING

We used the BuccalAmp™ DNA Extraction Kit from Epicentre Biotechnologies (Madison, WI USA). Buccal cells were collected from Puritan sterile cheek swabs after rinsing the mouth with tap water. The rs6265 SNP was assayed by a combination of nested PCR and melting-curve analysis with Tm-shift primers (Wang et al., 2005). The DNA fragment was preamplified from genomic DNA (300 bp) and used as a template for second round (allelespecific) PCR on a Bio-Rad MyiQ thermal cycler, which allows automated melting temperature analysis of the PCR products. One allele-specific primer was designed with a 5' GC tail, resulting in an easily detectable increase in the melting temperature of the PCR product. For rs6265, the forward and reverse primers used in the first PCR were 5' ACTCTGGAGAGCGTGAATGG 3' and 5' CCAAAGGCACTTGACTACTGA 3'. In the second round PCR, the primer specific to the ""G"" allele (val) was 5′ GCGGGCAGGGCGGCTCATCCAA CAACTCTTCTAACAC 3', the primer specific to the ""A"" allele (met) was 5' TCATCCAACAACTCTTCTACCAT 3' and the common primer was 5' CCAAGGCAGGTTCAAG 3'. Genetic data was analyzed using a dominance model such that Met carriers were combined into a single group.

# COGNITIVE ASSESSMENT

The task-switching paradigm is frequently used to assess executive processes (Kramer et al., 1999a; Kray and Lindenberger, 2000; Gratton et al., 2009; Gold et al., 2010; Jimura and Braver, 2010), including cognitive flexibility and inhibition (Verstynen et al., 2012). The task-switch paradigm was administered as part of a larger battery of tasks, but was selected for the present study because (1) it assesses executive functioning and (2) our previous studies have shown that this task is sensitive to exercise interventions (Kramer et al., 1999a,b). Therefore, we selected this task because it met criteria for testing mediation.

As described in Voss et al. (2010a), participants utilized colorbased cues to determine whether they were to judge whether a number was odd or even, or whether it was low or high (i.e., smaller or larger than 5). The numbers were presented individually for 1500 ms against a pink or blue background. If the background was blue, participants had to determine whether the number was high (""X"" key) or low (""Z"" key). If the background was pink, participants were to report whether the number was odd (""N"" key) or even (""M"" key). In both cases, participants were asked to answer as quickly as possible (Voss et al., 2010a). Participants completed a practice block followed by two blocks of individually presented tasks, one block consisted of only the ""high or low"" task, and the other consisted of only the ""odd or even"" task. This was followed by a switching block, which included 120 trials with the task in each trial chosen randomly. In this block, some trials were repeated, referred to here as ""repeat trials,"" and some trials switched between the two conditions, referred to here as ""switch trials"" (see Figure 1 for task depiction).

Accuracy (% correct) and reaction time (RT) served as indices of performance on the task-switch test. Accuracy (% correct) and time (RT) was recorded separately for single trials, repeat trials within the mixed block, and switch trials within the mixed block. Local switch cost, the difference between repeat trials (when the preceding trial involved the same task) and switch trials (when the preceding trial involved a different task) was calculated for both RT and accuracy (Verstynen et al., 2012). Additionally, global switch cost, the difference between switch trials and single task trials, was calculated for RT and accuracy.

## STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

All variables were tested for normality and skew. To assess whether age was inversely associated with serum BDNF, we conducted a multivariable linear regression analysis. BDNF genotype was included as a covariate in the model to adjust for effects of the val66met polymorphism on BDNF serum concentrations.

To examine whether the effect of exercise group (walking; stretching) on serum BDNF varied as a function of age, multivariable linear regression was employed using the bootstrap method with 10,000 resampling iterations. Therefore, main effects and interaction effects were estimated from the resampled data repeatedly drawn from the original dataset with replacement. Within the regression model, pre-intervention serum BDNF was included as a covariate to account for any group-level differences in serum BDNF at baseline. Gender and the BDNF val66met polymorphism were also adjusted for in the model. Exercise group and age were entered as predictor terms to determine whether age and group independently predicted change in serum BDNF. We also included an age × group interaction in order to test whether age moderated the effect of exercise group on change in serum BDNF.

We also predicted that age would moderate the association between exercise group and cognitive performance postintervention. To test this hypothesis, we used multivariable linear regression adjusting for gender, years of education, baseline serum BDNF, the BDNF val66met polymorphism, and baseline cognitive performance. Thus, rather than modeling withinsubject changes in cognitive performance, we assessed grouplevel differences in performance post-intervention, accounting for individual differences in performance at baseline. Again, bootstrapping was applied to the regression model, using 10,000 iterations. Also entered was group, age as a continuous variable, and their interaction product. A statistical threshold of p < 0.05 was used to determine significance for the linear regression analyses. Significant interactions revealed by the linear regression analyses were then subjected to repeated measures analysis of variance tests to assess within-subject changes from pre to post-intervention.

Finally, conditional process modeling was used to examine the conditional nature by which exercise group predicts cognitive function following the 1-year intervention. Using this procedure,

![](_page_4_Figure_2.jpeg)

we examined whether BDNF serum levels mediated the relationship between exercise group and cognitive performance, and whether the indirect effect of exercise group on cognitive performance through serum BDNF varied as a function of age. This technique estimates the mediating effect of serum BDNF on the relationship between exercise group and task-switch performance, while accounting for moderating effects of age on (1) the effect of exercise group on serum BDNF and (2) the direct effect of exercise group on task-switch performance. The model format and analyses were conducted using the PROCESS macro by Hayes (2013) in SPSS. This method provided an estimation of both the direct and indirect pathways, resulting in the calculation of 95% confidence intervals (CI) for both direct and indirect effects (see Figure 2 for model depiction). The regression coefficients are displayed in unstandardized form, as the bootstrapped CI's correspond to the unstandardized effects rather than the standardized effects. Mediation results are considered significant if the CI's do not contain 0.

# RESULTS

## SUBJECT CHARACTERISTICS AT BASELINE

The exercise groups did not significantly differ in age, gender, years of education, serum BDNF, or VO2max at baseline (all p > 0.05) (see Table 1). Additionally, there were no significant differences between groups on task switch performance indices at baseline (all p > 0.05; see Table 2 for task switch accuracy and reaction time data pre and post-intervention).

## AGE MODERATES THE FFFECT OF EXERCISE ON CHANGE IN SERUM BDNF

The BDNF val66met polymorphism was not related to serum BDNF at baseline (r = 0.018; p = 0.868). Nonetheless, in the regression analyses described below we continued to control for BDNF val66met variation because several prior studies have indicated a small, but significant, relation between serum BDNF and the BDNF val66met polymorphism (Lang et al., 2009). We also found that females had significantly higher levels of serum BDNF at baseline in this sample (r = 0.266; p = 0.010) and therefore included gender as a covariate in the analyses below. Consistent with our hypothesis, older ages were associated with lower serum BDNF levels prior to the start of the intervention (t = - 3.501; p = 0.001), after controlling for gender and the BDNF val66met polymorphism.

Collapsed across the intervention and control groups, age did not predict change in serum BDNF over the 1-year period (B = - 77.69; p = 0.489). Similarly, holding age constant, there was not a main effect of exercise group on change in serum BDNF following the intervention, although the association was trending (B = 2652.27; p = 0.084). However, the lack of main effects was qualified by a significant interaction between age and exercise

![](_page_5_Figure_2.jpeg)

group on change in serum BDNF (B = 471.95; p = 0.036) (see Table 3). Specifically, across the 1-year intervention, the stretching and toning group showed a decline in BDNF levels for the oldest individuals. In contrast, there was a positive linear relationship between age and serum BDNF in the walking group, indicating that older aged individuals experienced the greatest increase in BDNF following 1-year of moderate intensity walking exercise (see Figure 3B).

For further exploration of this interaction, we used repeated measures analysis of variance and divided the sample into higher and lower aged individuals using the median value for age (Md age = 65). Serum BDNF at baseline and serum BDNF post-intervention were entered as the within subjects factor, age and exercise group were entered as between subjects factors, and BDNF genotype and gender were entered as covariates. Consistent with the results from the regression, participation in the walking group offset an age-related reduction in BDNF levels (F = 5.45; p = 0.022; ng = 0.060) (see Figure 3). In particular, 12 months of moderate intensity walking exercise increased serum BDNF levels among adults older than 65 years of age, while similarly aged individuals in the non-aerobic condition showed a decrease in serum BDNF over the 12-month intervention period.

## AGE MODERATES THE EFFECT OF EXERCISE ON TASK-SWITCH PERFORMANCE

There was not a significant relation between education, baseline serum BDNF, or the BDNF val66met polymorphism and performance for any of the task switch outcomes (all p > 0.05). However, males had a smaller global accuracy cost at baseline (r = - 0.210; p = 0.046), so gender was used as a covariate in the regression model below. Further, although education and BDNF serum and genotype were not significantly related to task-switch outcomes, we included these variables as covariates in the regression model since prior research has reported effects of education and BDNF on cognitive outcomes in late adulthood (Albert et al., 1995; Erickson et al., 2008; Gunstad et al., 2008). Including these variables in the model provides a more conservative estimate of the associations between exercise group, change in serum BDNF, and change in task-switch performance.

The linear regression model showed that there was not a main effect of group on global accuracy percent cost [(switch trial accuracy-single trial accuracy)/single trial accuracy] post-intervention (B = 5.952; p = 0.097), although the relation was trending. These results suggest that the control group demonstrated a marginally greater deficit in accuracy between single and switch trials relative to those in the walking group at post-intervention. Additionally, there was not a significant main effect of age on global accuracy cost (B = - 0.055; p = 0.868). But, there was an interaction between age and exercise group

on changes in global accuracy cost (B = 1.645; p = 0.026) (see Table 4). Decomposing this interaction revealed that global accuracy cost remained constant over the 12 month period across all ages within the aerobic exercise group. In contrast, within the stretching and toning control group, there was an age-related increase in percent accuracy cost following the 1-year intervention. Thus, while the magnitude of the global accuracy cost remained constant across all ages in the walking group, older aged individuals within the non-aerobic condition demonstrated a larger cost on performance following the 12-month intervention.

We probed the interaction using a repeated measures analysis of variance, and divided the sample into higher and lower aged individuals using the median age value (Md age = 65). Global accuracy cost at baseline and post-intervention were entered as the within subjects factor, age and exercise group were entered as between subjects factors, and gender, years of education, BDNF genotype, and serum BDNF at baseline were included as covariates. In accordance with the results from the regression analysis, age-related reduction in task performance was negated by participation in the aerobic exercise condition (F = 5.19; p = 0.025; n2 = 0.064).

In contrast, there was not a significant main effect of exercise group (B = 0.602; p = 0.633) on local accuracy (switch accuracy - repeat accuracy/repeat accuracy) cost. There was also a non-significant relation between age and local accuracy cost (B = 0.156; p = 0.103) and a non-significant age x exercise group interaction on local accuracy cost (B = 0.265; p = 0.136).

Because of the significant effects on global accuracy cost, we conducted post-hoc analyses to examine percent accuracy separately for single trials, repeat trials, and switch trials, adjusting for gender, education, trial accuracy at baseline, baseline serum BDNF and the BDNF genotype. For single trial accuracy, there was not a main effect of age (B = - 0.051; p = 0.394) or group (B = 0.530; p = 0.361) nor was there a significant age x group interaction (B = - 0.092; p = 0.433). Similarly, there was not a direct effect of age (B = - 0.283; p = 0.438) or group (B = 3.384;

![](0__page_7_Figure_2.jpeg)

p = 0.352) on repeat trial accuracy, or an age x group interaction term on repeat trial accuracy (B = 0.747; p = 0.321). Finally, there was not an effect of age (B = - 0.075; p = 0.832), group (B = 4.995; p = 0.154), or their product (B = 1.126; p = 0.124) on switch trial accuracy. These results suggest that the significant age × group interaction on global accuracy cost was specific to global cost, a purer measure of cognitive flexibility, rather than performance on any specific trial type.

Age did not moderate the effect of exercise on RT for any of the variables, including single RT, repeat RT, switch RT, or switch cost (all p > 0.05).

## BDNF MEDIATES EFFECT OF EXERCISE ON TASK-SWITCH PERFORMANCE AS A FUNCTION OF AGE

The prior analyses demonstrated that the effect of exercise group on BDNF serum levels and task-switch performance varied as a function of age. Specifically, relative to the non-aerobic control condition, 12 months of moderate intensity aerobic exercise led to an increase in serum BDNF and an improvement in task performance (lower cost on global accuracy) that varied with age, with the oldest individuals showing the greatest benefits. Next, we tested whether serum BDNF mediates the association between exercise group and change in global accuracy cost following the 1-year intervention. Additionally, due to the robust age effects observed, a moderated mediation conditional processes model

was used to examine whether serum BDNF explained the relation between exercise group and task-switch performance as a function of age. Thus, we first examined whether serum BDNF mediated the relation between exercise group and global accuracy cost. Then, we assessed whether the mediating effect of serum BDNF varied as a function of age. For these analyses, we focused only on the task variables that showed a significant age × group interaction effect (i.e., global accuracy cost). Since gender, education, and the BDNF val66met polymorphism did not significantly modify any of the above outcomes, they were removed from subsequent mediation models.

Mediation analyses revealed that there was not a direct effect of exercise group on global accuracy cost, after accounting for baseline serum BDNF and baseline global accuracy cost [B = 4.541; p = 0.160; CI(SE) -1.831; 10.912 (3.203)]. In contrast, there was a significant indirect effect of exercise group on global accuracy cost through serum BDNF [B = 1.317; CI(SE).058; 4.66 (1.007)]. Specifically, participants in the walking group scored, on average, 1.36 percent better on global accuracy cost, which was mediated by exercise-induced changes in serum BDNF levels. The average global accuracy cost was negative (-7.96%) indicating a smaller performance deficit between single and switch trials. Thus, 1 year of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise increased levels of serum BDNF, which, in turn, led to a decrease in cost performance.

Further, the conditional process analysis showed that there was a conditional indirect effect of exercise group on global accuracy cost through BDNF serum that differed by age [B = 0.168; CI(SE).009; 0.567 (0.129)] (see Table 5). Further inspection revealed that serum BDNF levels mediated the relationship between exercise group and task-switch performance specifically for older aged individuals (see Figure 4).

While the above analyses included age as a continuous predictor, to determine the age at which effects of BDNF mediated task switch accuracy cost, age was divided into quintiles (10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th percentiles). Effects were then calculated for Table 5 | Moderated mediation model of effects of exercise group on global accuracy cost.

the relationship between exercise group and task switch accuracy cost. Bars indicate age quintiles (10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th percentiles) on the x-axis. Sample distribution is as follows: Age <60: n = 13: 61-63: n = 21; 64-65; n = 12; 66-71: n = 23; 71-76: n = 16; >77: n = 7.

each of these percentiles of age (60, 63, 65, 71, and 76 years), revealing that serum BDNF mediated the relationship between exercise group and task switch accuracy cost only among participants whose ages were in the 75th [B = 1.714; CI(SE) 0.260; 5.382 (1.183)] and 90th percentiles [B = 2.553; CI(SE) 0.390; 7.807 (1.716)], or 71 years of age and older. Thus, changes in serum BDNF mediated the relationship between exercise group and task performance, specifically for participants aged 71 years and older.

### DISCUSSION

In line with our hypotheses, changes in serum BDNF mediated the effect of the exercise intervention on task-switch performance. Interestingly, this effect varied as a function of age such that only individuals older than 71 years of age showed a significant mediating effect of BDNF on task-switch performance. Of note, this relationship is significant in a regression model using baseline task-switch performance as a covariate and when examining change in a RM-ANOVA analysis. These results indicate that moderate-intensity physical activity, such as walking, may be more beneficial to both BDNF and task-switching performance for adults over the age of 70 than younger individuals.

Similar to previous research (Ziegenhorn et al., 2007; Flöel et al., 2010), our results demonstrate that older age was associated with lower BDNF serum levels. However, this relationship was not present after the 1-year intervention for the walking exercise group. Exercise increased BDNF levels, but age moderated this relationship such that older adults in the walking group showed increases in BDNF that their younger exercising group members, nor their stretching control counterparts, displayed. This moderating effect of age may account for heterogeneity in the literature that report negligible associations between longer durations of exercise and BDNF levels in middle-aged adults and in samples with a limited age range (Schulz et al., 2004; Schiffer et al., 2009),

Of particular interest, we found evidence that serum BDNF mediated the association between a 12-month exercise intervention and improvements in executive function, but find that this mediating effect is dependent on the age of the sample. Rodent studies have also reported that BDNF mediates the effects of exercise on cognition and related brain pathways (Van Hoomissen et al., 2004; Vaynman et al., 2004; Hopkins and Bucci, 2010; Gómez-Pinilla and Feng, 2012). Yet, the current study is the first to demonstrate this effect in humans through a randomized controlled trial, and including both serum BDNF and BDNF genotype. What makes the current analyses unique is that the mediating effect of BDNF on cognition is independent of BDNF genotype, and present only in adults over the age of 70. These results highlight that age-related decreases in serum BDNF may be successfully mitigated by participation in exercise and that this might be a critical mechanism by which exercise improves executive function in late adulthood.

Our results also demonstrate that BDNF mediated the effect of exercise on task-switch accuracy cost, but not on response time, in adults aged 70 years or older. Accuracy on the task-switch paradigm is often interpreted as a measure of executive function ability to execute the task demands, while response times are interpreted as a measure of cognitive control, processing speed or efficiency (Hughes et al., 2013). Thus, our results demonstrate that the effects of exercise on the ability to execute the demands of a challenging task that taps into executive functions are mediated by BDNF in adults over the age of 70. We can only speculate as to the reason for the non-significant effects on response times. One possibility is that there are selective effects of BDNF on the neural correlates that support accuracy verses response times (Hughes et al., 2013). Specifically, BDNF may be mediating the effect of exercise on the prefrontal and parietal regions that support executive function (Jimura et al., 2014) and the ""top-down"" processing required for task-switch accuracy (Phillips et al., 2013), and not the striatum or regions which are associated with processing speed or response time outcomes (Jimura et al., 2014). Still, our

results suggest that the modification in the level of serum BDNF is an important pathway by which exercise influences executive function for adults over 70 years of age.

Despite the strengths of our study, there remain several important limitations. First, analyses and interpretation of the results are based on serum BDNF levels, rather than BDNF directly from brain tissue. Importantly, rodent studies have found significant correlations between cortical BDNF and circulating BDNF levels (Karege et al., 2002), despite controversy on the validity of serum BDNF as a proxy for cortical concentrations (Knaepen et al., 2010). Thus, we believe that this is an acceptable limitation given the obvious challenges of obtaining brain tissue from human subjects. Additionally, while the sample size of each intervention group is similar-to or larger-than previous randomized clinical trials, the statistical models employed in the current analyses limit degrees of freedom and require a large sample to detect effects. It is possible that a larger sample would strengthen current findings or reveal effects in younger ages. Additionally, the current sample was mostly female with little representation of racial minorities, preventing generalization to a population outside of female Caucasians. Finally, our sample was relatively homogeneous without outward signs of cognitive impairment. Therefore, a more varied sample with different demographic characteristics and cognitive abilities may find different results than those described here.

The current findings indicate that adults over the age of 70 may gain the most from aerobic exercise in terms of both serum BDNF and task-switch performance. Indeed, the current sample shows no significant difference in BDNF serum levels or task switch performance at follow-up between the control and exercise intervention groups, however when examined as a function of age, BDNF levels significantly mediate the effect of exercise group on improvements in executive function. The results from this study do not preclude positive effects of exercise on other cognitive domains, other age ranges, other populations, or other putative mechanistic pathways (i.e., inflammatory). These findings highlight the importance of considering both age and BDNF when designing exercise interventions and interpreting the mechanism by which exercise improves cognitive performance, particularly in the elderly.

Keywords: Suicide Epidemiology Aging

# A B S T R A C T

Background: Suicidal ideation is more strongly associated with suicidal intent in later life, so risk factors may also differ by age. We investigated whether the relationship between suicidal ideation and established correlates varied by age in a representative population.

Methods: We used data from the 2007 Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey of England to assess the relationship between age and suicidal thoughts across 20-year age bands, using logistic regression, adjusted for survey weights. We used mediation analyses to assess the extent to which other factors mediate the relationship between suicidal thoughts and age.

Results: Reports of previous-year suicidal thoughts decreased with age. This was partly explained by (1) lower rates of reported child abuse (in those aged 75+), of depression, and of anxiety symptoms (in those aged 55+), factors all strongly associated with suicidal thoughts, and (2) higher rates of protective factors in people aged 35+, specifically homeownership and cohabitation. Rates of phobias, irritability and compulsions also decreased with age, and the association of these symptoms with suicidal thoughts was particularly strong in the youngest (16–34) age group. People who reported experiencing childhood abuse in all age groups reported more suicidal thoughts, suggesting abuse has lifelong negative effects on suicidal ideation.

Limitations: The response rate was 57%. Older people may be less likely to recall childhood abuse. Conclusions: Sexual and physical abuse in childhood are associated with suicidal ideas throughout the lifespan, so screening for suicidal ideas in younger and older people should be routine and vigorous, and cover experiences in early life: management may require appropriate psychological interventions.

# 1. Background

Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death worldwide (Hawton and van Heeringen, 2009). Effective risk prevention requires identification of those most likely to experience suicidal ideation and make non-lethal suicide attempts, as these thoughts and behaviours greatly increase the risk of suicide. The risk factors for suicidal ideation and actions differ from those of completed suicide. In particular, middle aged men are at greatest risk of completed suicide (Office of National Statistics, 2013b), while suicidal thoughts, plans and intent are more frequently reported by younger women. The ratio of self-harm to completed suicide falls with increasing age from more than 200 to one in teenagers to less than 10 to one in people over 60 years of age (Hawton and Harriss, 2008). Physical frailty and a greater determination to die (Conwell et al., 1998) may conspire to increase the risk of death from each episode of self-harm in older people. Research in this age group has consistently shown that self-harm frequently involves strong suicidal intent (Salib et al., 2001). Thus, suicidal ideation may differ qualitatively in older people and their younger counterparts, and the established predictors might vary correspondingly. Some people exhibiting suicidal ideation in younger and midlife die by suicide before reaching older age, but most do not, as completed suicide is rare while suicidal thoughts are common. Thus surviving to old age cannot significantly explain the reduced suicidality among older people.

Mental disorders are important predictors of suicidal ideation and completed suicide (Gunnell and Lewis, 2005). Epidemiological studies indicate that the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms and disorders (other than dementia) decreases with age (Alonso et al., 2004;McBride et al., 2013;McManus et al., 2009). The decrease in mental disorders in older age is concordant with the decrease in reported suicidal ideation. However, physical illness and disability are more prevalent in older age groups (Russell et al., 2009), and as they are associated with suicidal ideation this would tend to counteract the effect of reduced susceptibility to common mental disorders. Other consistent cross-national risk factors for suicidal ideation, plans and attempts include female gender, less education, not being married, and stressful life events (Nock et al., 2008).

Recent papers on childhood abuse, psychiatric disorder, and suicide attempts and ideation detail the impact of early trauma on adult psychiatric morbidity and behaviour, particularly suicidal acts and self-harm (Bebbington et al., 2009; Jonas et al., 2011). Although the quality of childhood care may be extremely important in determining the way in which older adults cope with the threats and losses to independence from ageing and its associated life events (Martindale, 2007), there is very little research linking childhood trauma, mental state and behaviour in older people. Some might question the ability of older people to recall their childhood relationships as accurately as younger adults, for whom the experiences are more recent. However, memories with powerful, personal emotional significance are usually maintained over the lifespan (Holland and Kensinger, 2010). While some studies have suggested that up to 40% of childhood abuse may be forgotten or repressed for a time, this forgetting does not appear to be associated with age (Berntsen and Rubin, 2002). While around 5% of people aged over 60 have dementia (Ferri et al., 2005), dementia often provokes the re-experiencing of trauma from childhood sexual assault, because early, implicit, traumatic memories become relatively more important as explicit, more recent memories are lost (Australian Institute of Family Studies, 2010). Thus, why should a seventy-year-old adult recall childhood trauma in any way differently from a forty-year-old?

There are nonetheless more general problems relating to the investigation of childhood abuse, due to the pervasive stigma that attaches to it (Coffey et al., 1996). Collecting accurate information about it in epidemiological surveys remains methodologically challenging. The 2007 English Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey offers advantages in this respect, seeking to overcome the effects of stigma by using computer assisted self interview (CASI) in the section relating to abuse. The survey thereby provided information on suicidal thoughts, childhood adversity and mental health in a large sample of the English adult household population.

We investigated the correlates of thoughts of suicide in this representative population in order to identify disparities in their origins between younger and older age groups (16-34 years, 35-54 years, 55-74 years and 75+ ). Based on the existing literature, we hypothesised that there would be differences in the relationship between suicidal thoughts and age group moderated by the effects of mental illness, substance misuse, sociodemographic characteristics (Nock et al., 2008), physical ill health, social networks (Handley et al., 2014) and childhood abuse (Bebbington et al., 2009; Jonas et al., 2011).

## 2. Method

### 2.1. Sample

We used data from the 2007 Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey. Unlike previous surveys in this programme (Jenkins et al., 2009), it covered only England and there was no upper age limit. The sample was designed to be representative of people living in private households. The survey adopted a multi-stage stratified probability sampling design. The sampling frame was the small user Postcode Address File. One adult aged 16 years or over was selected for interview in each eligible household using the Kish grid method (Kish, 1965). Full details of the sampling method, procedure and quality control are published elsewhere (McManus et al., 2009). Ethical approval for the survey was obtained from one of the Research Ethics Committees of the National Research Ethics Service appropriate for non-clinical populations. The interviews involved computerassisted personal interviewing (CAPI), with answers entered by the interviewers directly into a laptop. Particularly sensitive information was collected by computer assisted self-completion interview (CASI). The laptop was given to the participant for this. The respondents knew beforehand that the interviewer was unable to see the results of the self-completed parts of the interview, which included questions about childhood abuse. Fifty seven per cent of the eligible sample took part, and full interviews were successfully carried out on 7403 people; 7353 completed the CASI section on childhood abuse, while 50 people refused or were unable to complete this. Reasons given included: sight impairment, not being able to read, and refusal. Where this was the case respondents were offered the option of having the CASI questions read aloud.

# 2.2. Variables

We selected sociodemographic and illness characteristics previously identified as predictors of suicidal ideation (e.g. Nock et al., 2008).

## 2.2.1. Sociodemographic information

Standardised questions provided information about age, gender, cohabitation status and home ownership. Alcohol use in the past 6 months was recorded using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) (Saunders et al., 1993). Respondents with an AUDIT score of 8 or more were classed as having hazardous use of alcohol. Participants were asked about the number of adults they felt close to as a measure of their primary support network. This was dichotomised for analysis at a network size of > 3 people, as recommended in previous literature (Brugha et al., 2003).

### 2.2.2. Mental illness

Non-psychotic psychiatric disorders were assessed in relation to the past week, using the Clinical Interview Schedule-Revised (CIS-R) (Lewis et al., 1992). This can be administered by nonclinically trained interviewers. It provides scores for symptoms relating to common mental disorders. We analysed the subscales individually (see Table 1). Scores of 2 or more were used to denote the presence of individual symptoms (McBride et al., 2013).

### 2.2.3. Physical health/disability

We included two variables measuring this. The first was a subjective item ""My health limits moderate activities"" yes/no from the SF-12 quality of life measure (Ware et al., 1996). Participants were also asked whether they needed help with any of seven Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). The ADLs were: personal care; mobility; medical care such as taking pills, having injections or changes of dressing; preparing meals, shopping, laundry and housework; practical activities such as gardening, decorating, or household repairs; dealing with paperwork; and managing money. This was developed from a previous measure (Bebbington et al., 2000).

### 2.2.4. Childhood sexual and physical abuse

Respondents were asked about different types and levels of abuse. It was possible to distinguish abuse occurring in childhood and adolescence (i.e. before 16 years) from that occurring in

adulthood. Reported physical abuse in childhood was defined as ""a severe beating by parent or carer before the age of 16 years"". Reported sexual abuse in childhood combined responses to two items and was defined in the analysis as ""sexual abuse ranging from inappropriate touching to non-consensual sexual intercourse before the age of 16 years"". Intercourse before 16 reported as consensual (which is legally defined as child sexual abuse) was not included in the definition of abuse for this survey.

reported thinking about taking their own life, based on the question ""Have you ever thought of taking your life, even though you would not actually do it?"" A positive response to suicidal thoughts was followed up by asking whether this last occurred in the past week, past year or longer ago. Thoughts in the previous year were used in the analysis. Participants were also asked whether they had attempted suicide in the past year.

## 2.3. Analysis

2.2.5. Dependent variable: 'suicidal thoughts in the previous year' The term 'suicidal thoughts' used in the analysis was given a narrow definition - it included only those respondents who

We weighted data by the strata, sampling units and sampling weights. The survey data were weighted to take account of survey design and non-response, so that the results were representative

of the household population aged 16 years and over. Weighting was necessarily complex, and more details are available in the main report (McManus et al., 2009). We used Stata (Statacorp, 2013) and the SVY (survey data) commands with these weights for both descriptive and inferential statistics.

We used methods accounting for the survey design to approximate counts and standard errors. We performed survey weighted multivariable logistic regressions to investigate the association between suicidal thoughts and age as a categorical variables (16-34 years, 35-54 years, 55-74 years and 75+), adjusting for other factors. The factors considered in the multivariable analyses were: demographic factors (gender, qualifications, being a home owner, and living with a partner), disability (reporting disability and needing help with ADLs), child abuse (reporting child sexual or physical abuse) and mental health (CIS-R subscales). We used the 'medeff' module in Stata (Hicks and Tingley, 2011, 2012) to assess the extent to which each of these factors mediates the association between age and suicidal thoughts. The 'medeff' command estimates mediation effects; it provides the percentage of the indirect effect accounted for by the factors studied.

Finally, for variables where there was significant variation in the total effect mediated across age groups, we used the userwritten Stata command 'Idecomp' (Buis, 2014) to estimate factual (e.g. the actual proportion of 16–34 year olds reporting suicidal ideation) and counterfactual proportions (e.g. the proportion of 16-34 year olds who would report suicidal ideation if they were exposed to the same risk factors, operating in the same way as people aged 75+ ). This method enabled us to estimate the direct effect of the variables studied on suicidal ideation and the indirect effect (amount of these effects explained by age), and total effects such that the direct and indirect effects add up to the total effect.

#### 3. Results

#### 3.1. Suicidal thoughts and attempts in the year prior to interview.

The sample ranged in age from 16 to 95 years. Thoughts about suicide in the previous year (recent suicidal thoughts) were reported by 339 (4.3%) of the sample. Recent suicidal thoughts were significantly more common in younger age groups. They were reported by 88 (5.1%) participants aged 16–34, 165 (5.4%) of participants aged 35-54, 66 (2.4%) of participants aged 55-74 and 20 (2.2%) of those aged 75 and above (Table 1). Only 52 people reported suicide attempts in the last year, 13 of those aged 16-34, 33 of those aged 35-54, six of those aged 55-74 and none in the oldest age group. All but one of the people reporting a suicide attempt also reported suicidal thoughts.

## 3.2. Effect of socio-demographic factors

Suicidal thoughts in the past year were more likely to be reported by female respondents, and those who drank more alcohol, but less likely by those who owned their own homes, lived with a partner or had more than three close personal relationships. Respondents aged 16-34 were less likely to be living with a partner or living in a home they owned than older respondents. The protective effect of these two demographic characteristics was significantly modulated by age, being relatively greater in people aged 16-34 (as demonstrated by the higher % total mediated effect in these age categories for these characteristics, shown in Table 2). Table 3 sets out the factual and counterfactual proportions for these relationships. It shows that the true proportion of people aged 16–34 who report suicidal thoughts was

ª Percentage by age group reporting suicidal the % prediced to report suicidal thoughts if the distribution of each of the characteristics studied changed to that found in a different age group.

b True proportions vary due to slightly different population for which this information available,

5.2%, but if their likelihood of living with a partner equalled that of people aged 35-54 or 55-74, only 3.8% would report these thoughts, because living with a partner is protective. Similarly, the proportion of respondents aged 16-34 who reported suicidal ideation would be around one percentage point lower (4% vs 5%) if their rate of home ownership was as high as that of people in the older age groups.

# 3.3. Effects of child abuse

Childhood sexual and physical abuse were both strong predictors of recent suicidal thoughts. Childhood sexual abuse was associated with a fourfold, and physical abuse a five fold increase in risk of experiencing suicidal ideation in unadjusted analyses (Table 2). Abuse was less frequently reported by people aged 75+, but the relationship between reporting these events and having recent suicidal thoughts varied very little with age.

## 3.4. Effects of physical health characteristics

As expected, the proportion of people reporting moderate disability or needing help with ADLs rose sharply with age. These characteristics were associated with reporting more suicidal thoughts, and this relationship was stronger in the youngest (16-34) and oldest (aged 75+) age groups. In Table 3, the factual and counterfactual proportions demonstrate that the proportion of people aged 75+ reporting suicidal ideation would theoretically reduce from 2.2% to 1.0% if they had the same level of need for help with ADLs as people aged 16-34. Similarly, the proportion of the youngest people reporting suicidal ideation would theoretically be 10.8% rather than 5.2% if they had the same level of need for ADL help as people aged 75 +.

#### 3.5. Effects of mental health symptoms

Depressive ideas and symptoms of worry were strongly associated with reporting suicidal thoughts across all age groups, as expected. These symptoms were more frequently reported by younger respondents (aged under 55 years). The strength of the relationship between these symptoms and suicidal ideation was comparable across the age groups.

Symptoms of irritability, phobias and compulsions also declined with age. As well as occurring more frequently, these symptoms were all more strongly associated with reporting suicidal ideas in the youngest (16-34) than in older groups. In Table 3, the counterfactual proportions demonstrate that if people aged 16-34 had levels of irritability, phobias and compulsions comparable to those aged 75+, then instead of 5.2% their rates of reported suicidal ideation would be 3.2%, 3.9% and 4.4% respectively.

## 4. Discussion

Psychiatric morbidity, childhood sexual and physical abuse, physical illness and disability, hazardous alcohol use, small social networks and not living with a partner or owning one's home were

all associated with recent suicidal thoughts across all age groups. The primary aim of our study was to clarify why suicidal thoughts decline in frequency across the life span. Our findings suggest that the lower frequency of reported depression and anxiety symptoms in people aged 55 and over, and of child abuse reported by people aged 75 and over might explain the lower rates of suicidal ideas reported by older people, given that these characteristics are strongly related to suicidal ideation across all ages in our sample. People in the youngest age group also had the highest rates of irritability, compulsions and phobias, and these symptoms were particularly strongly related to suicidal ideation in this group.

Younger people (aged 16-34) also had the lowest rates of home ownership and co-habitation, both of which protected against suicidal ideation; among those younger people who did own their home or co-habit, these characteristics were relatively more protective against suicidal thoughts than in older age groups. We speculate that people in this age group who were single or renting their accommodation may have been more likely to view these situations as undesirable (and be trying to change them), whereas in older age groups these circumstances may have been life choices for some, and, where they were not, at least more accepted. This may also be a cohort effect, as home ownership levels rose steadily from 23% in 1918 to 69% in 2001, thus becoming an expected achievement for many (Office of National Statistics, 2013a). The recent decline in home ownership in Britain following the financial crisis of 2008 post-dated this survey, and might conduce to a subsequent increase in suicidal ideation.

We were particularly interested in why people in older age groups report low levels of suicidal ideation. The high rates of disability in people aged 75+ are striking. Our findings that psychiatric morbidity and ADL impairments were associated with suicidal thoughts across the age groups accord with previous studies (Dennis et al., 2007; Dennis et al., 2009). Disability was an important predictor of suicidal thoughts in the youngest and the oldest age groups, so the lower rate of suicidal thoughts in people aged 75+ cannot be explained as a greater tolerance of disability and impairment.

This oldest age group were also less likely than those in middle age to be living with a partner, an important protector against suicidal ideation. It has been suggested that rates of mental illness symptoms are lower in older people because of under-reporting, and our study cannot rule this out. However, if this were so, older people should be more likely to have suicidal ideation at a given level of mental symptoms than their younger counterparts, but we did not find this.

The association between childhood sexual abuse and suicidal ideation has been highlighted in previous publications from this survey (Jonas et al., 2011). We found in the current paper that the association between child physical abuse and suicidal ideation was even greater than that between child sexual abuse and suicidal ideation, although the definition used for physical abuse, a severe beating, may have only detected more severe physical abuse. This is the first study to include childhood abuse in a comparison of the correlates of suicidal thinking across age groups: it appears to indicate that the negative effects of abuse on suicidality are lifelong. Many people who are abused as children end up in difficult relationships as adults (Jonas et al., 2011) and they may also have distorted ideas about their own self-worth and the way others feel about them, although we did not measure adult relationship quality or self-worth in the current study. The significance of strong and enduring relationships and their association with good mental health and well-being is well recognised in both genders (Gibb et al., 2011). Such an association must be the result of complex interactions, with choice of partner, the ability to work within a relationship, and the buffering and support provided by the relationship during times of stress all being important. The breakdown of a relationship has enormous effects on self-esteem and mental health, and is a well-recognised reason for people to state that they no longer have reasons to live.

### 4.1. Limitations

The British National Psychiatric Morbidity Programme involves repeated representative household surveys which have had decreasing response rates over time; the current response rate of 57% is fairly low, although comparable with other recent national surveys (Mindell et al., 2012) (and 70% of people successfully contacted did then agree to take part). We weighted the data to correct for nonresponse on a range of sociodemographic and area characteristics. Non-response weighting had little effect on the results, showing that non-responders seem to be similar to responders (Jonas et al., 2011). Moreover, the current study explored associations, so findings are relatively less sensitive to response bias than studies of prevalence. Just 20 people aged 75+ in the sample reported suicidal thoughts, and this is a significant limitation.

Great efforts were made in the survey to maintain the quality of information by using confidential data entry. The reported prevalence of childhood abuse decreased in older age. Some of this may be explained by shorter life expectancy in those experiencing adverse childhood events, by age-related increases in memory problems or by ""positivity"" of memories (Schlagman et al., 2006). The greater acceptance in recent years that childhood abuse, especially sexual abuse is common (Smart, 2000) may have had an effect, as abusive experiences, especially those at the less severe end of the spectrum may be more likely to be reported as abuse if they have been named as such at the time. However, even though reasons for lower levels of reported childhood abuse with increasing age remain obscure, the relationship between childhood abuse and lack of well-being remains strong in the older adult group.

Around 15% (n=52) of those reporting suicidal ideation also reported a suicide attempt in the last year. We did not distinguish those who reported acting on their thoughts from those reporting suicidal thought without associated actions. We could not analyse actual suicidal acts as the dependent variable because of the small number of participants reporting these actions, although we have previously reported that suicidal thinking represents a strong indicator of vulnerability to suicidal acts from the National Psychiatric Morbidity Surveys (Bebbington et al., 2010). Nonetheless as most people who have suicidal thoughts do not attempt suicide, knowledge about risk factors that can predict whether people with suicidal ideation progress to actual self harm are of critical importance for suicide prevention strategies, and other recent studies have completed such analyses (Glenn and Nock, 2014).

### 4.2. Implications

Our results provide further support for vigorous opportunistic screening for suicidal ideas in both young and old, as poor mental and physical health, disability, and social isolation are associated with suicidal ideation across all age groups.

The detrimental effect of childhood abuse appears to be maintained in older adults, probably operating through effects on selfesteem, and seems to increase the risk of thoughts of suicide. This indicates that clinicians should continue to ask about childhood experiences, as older people may benefit from appropriate psychological work for this, and for other relationship difficulties. Where there is insufficient family or peer support, it should be recognised that, in contradiction to current trends in mental and primary health care, there may be a need for longer term support from professional services. The alert listening ear of a regularly seen and trusted health worker may be crucial for older people.

Background. Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that cognitive behavioural psychotherapy (CBT) is an efficacious treatment for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). However, little is known about the mechanisms by which the treatment has its effect. The aim of this study was to investigate potential mechanisms of change underlying the efficacy of CBT for CFS. We applied path analysis and introduce novel model comparison approaches to assess a theoretical CBT model that suggests that fearful cognitions will mediate the relationship between avoidance behaviour and illness outcomes (fatigue and social adjustment).

Method. Data from 389 patients with CFS who received CBT in a specialist service in the UK were collected at baseline, at discharge from treatment, and at 3-, 6- and 12-month follow-ups. Path analyses were used to assess possible mediating effects. Model selection using information criteria was used to compare support for competing mediational models.

Results. Path analyses were consistent with the hypothesized model in which fear avoidance beliefs at the 3-month follow-up partially mediate the relationship between avoidance behaviour at discharge and social adjustment respectively at 6 months.

Conclusions. The results strengthen the validity of a theoretical model of CBT by confirming the role of cognitive and behavioural factors in CFS.

#### Introduction

Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a condition characterized by chronic disabling fatigue and other symptoms that are associated with profound disability and are not better explained by an alternative diagnosis (Sharpe & Chalder, 1994). There is now a growing body of evidence suggesting that specific treatments can improve these poor outcomes. A systematic review found that both cognitive behavioural psychotherapy (CBT) and graded exercise therapy (GET) are the most promising treatments for CFS/myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) in secondary care (Chambers et al. 2006). A Cochrane review confirmed that around 40% of patients with CFS report improvements in fatigue and social adjustment if they receive CBT (Price et al. 2008) and this finding was confirmed more recently in a large multi-centred randomized controlled trial (RCT) (White et al. 2011). In a non-randomized study CBT was effective in routine clinical practice although slightly less so than in the RCT (Quarmby et al. 2007).

Although CBT seems to be an effective treatment for CFS, a substantial proportion of patients do not improve. Identifying mechanisms of change may elucidate ways in which treatment can be developed, tailored or optimized to suit the needs of different individuals (Laurenceau et al. 2007). It may also provide us with information about the clinical utility of the model on which treatment is based.

The cognitive behavioural approach involves enabling individuals to develop a consistent approach to activity, gradually increase activity, develop healthy sleep patterns and identify and challenge unhelpful cognitions (Wessely et al. 1989; Sharpe & Chalder, 1994), with the primary aim of improving fatigue and social adjustment. In CFS, treatment is usually initially directed at behaviour change, with cognitive strategies being introduced once a consistent approach to activity has been established.

CBT for CFS is based on a fear avoidance beliefs model about physical activity. This model supposes that unhelpful catastrophic interpretations of symptoms and excessive focus on symptoms are central in driving disability and symptom severity (Wessely et al. 1989; Burgess et al. 2011). These cognitive responses are also associated with behavioural patterns that contribute to outcome, including avoidance of activity together with excessive rest, and all-or-nothing behaviour; a pattern of pushing too hard or being overactive when feeling well and then needing to rest up or do very little for prolonged periods.

Evidence for this model is growing. Catastrophic beliefs about the consequences of increasing activity have been shown to be associated with worse disability and fatigue in a cross-sectional study of CFS (Petrie et al. 1995). Similarly, avoiding exercise or activity and accommodating to the illness are all associated with greater disability in patients with CFS (Antoni et al. 1994; Ray et al. 1995; Chalder et al. 1996). In a laboratory-based experiment, patients' beliefs about the negative effects of activity predicted lack of persistence on an exercise bike over and above physiological correlates of exertion, symptom severity and distress (Silver et al. 2002). This finding was confirmed in a questionnaire study that showed that kinesiophobia was associated with activity limitations/participation restrictions in patients with CFS (Nijs et al. 2004).

In two of the earlier CBT trials (Sharpe et al. 1996; Deale et al. 1998), patients were significantly less likely to believe that avoidance of exercise was helpful after CBT. More recently, Wiborg et al. (2010) looked at whether actual physical activity changed with CBT in the context of three different trials: one compared CBT with 'guided support' and 'no intervention' control conditions (Prins et al. 2001), one trial in adolescents compared CBT with a waiting list control (Stulemeijer et al. 2005), and the other compared minimal CBT (self-help materials and email contact) with a waiting list control (Knoop et al. 2008). Physical activity, as measured by an actometer, was not associated with CBT or fatigue in any of the trials (Wiborg et al. 2010). The same authors set out to examine whether avoidance of activity, avoidance of aversive stimuli and focusing on fatigue mediated the effect of CBT on fatigue and impairment (Wiborg et al. 2010). The results suggested that symptom focusing but not behavioural avoidance may have mediated the effect of CBT on the outcomes.

In summary, studies to date suggest that change in cognitive responses but not behavioural avoidance may mediate the effect of CBT. However, none of the studies used mediators measured before the outcomes.

We hypothesized that, as CBT in this context focuses initially on changing avoidance behaviour, fearful cognitions will at least partially mediate the relationship between change in avoidance behaviour and illness outcomes (fatigue and disability). The current study allowed preliminary investigation of this possibility. We aimed to assess the hypotheses using data collected from routine cognitive behavioural psychotherapy patients. We first wanted to investigate whether reported improvements in disability and fatigue after CBT, within the context of a large RCT (White et al. 2011), can be replicated in routine treatment and will remain stable for up to 1 year after treatment has finished. A similar pattern of changes to that seen for CBT in the trial are expected for putative cognitive and behavioural responses. We then assessed the proposed model using mediational analysis based on path and structural equation models (MacKinnon, 2008) and compared our proposed model with the alternative that the relationship between fearful cognition and fatigue symptoms and disability respectively is mediated by avoidance behaviour. We introduced an information theoretic approach that allowed us to compare the strength of evidence for each of the competing models (Akaike, 1973; Burnham & Anderson, 2002). Subjects were measured at several time points after finishing CBT, which enabled us to assess variables in the order that reflected the putative temporal order of the model. Although the majority of changes in CBT usually occur by the end of the treatment, longitudinal modelling can potentially also take account of small changes between post-treatment and follow-up. Longitudinal mediation models with at least three waves of measurements are preferred over crosssectional models because they allow us to examine whether a change in one variable is more likely to produce changes in another variable than vice versa, even if the changes are small (MacKinnon, 2008). This approach allows the comparison of different partial mediation models using information criteria, which would not be possible if we used measurements taken at the same time point only. This is because such models would be structurally equivalent models and would produce the same model-data fit. Finally, in an exploratory study we aimed to generalize the results of the mediation analysis using putative latent traits of behavioural and cognitive responses.

## Method

#### Participants

Participants were recruited from consecutive general practitioner (GP) and consultant referrals to the CFS Research and Treatment Unit at King's College London and the South London and Maudsley National Health Service (NHS) Trust between 2002 and 2006. All participants who were treated at this Unit between 2002 and 2006 were included in the analysis. The intervention was evidence based and stable this time period.

The diagnosis of CFS was made by either an experienced consultant psychiatrist or an experienced cognitive behavioural psychotherapist according to Oxford (Sharpe et al. 1991) or US Centre for Disease Control case definitions. (Fukuda et al. 1994). The diagnosis was then confirmed by patients completing self-report questions that assessed all aspects of the case definitions. Treatment was offered to patients who fulfilled either definition according to the assessing health professional. Routine physical investigations were performed by either the patient's GP or the CFS Unit to exclude medical causes for fatigue. Eleven therapists trained specifically in cognitive behavioural psychotherapy and experienced in the treatment of CFS treated the patients. All received regular clinical supervision.

The study was approved by the Audit Committee of the Psychological Medicine Clinical Academic Group of King's Health Partners.

#### Outcome measures and potential mediators

All measures were completed by patients before their treatment started, at discharge from treatment (about 8 months after the start of treatment) and at 3, 6 and 12 months after discharge.

#### Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire (CFQ; Chalder et al. 1993)

This 11-item scale measures physical and mental fatigue. Item responses range from 'less than usual' to 'much more than usual'. Either a Likert (0, 1, 2, 3) or a bimodal (0, 1) scoring system can be used. The Likert method was used in this study. It has been shown to be both reliable and valid (Chalder et al. 1993; Cella & Chalder, 2010; Knudsen et al. 2011) and has been used in previous treatment trials of CFS (Deale et al. 1997; Quarmby et al. 2007).

## Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WASA; Mundt et al. 2002)

This disability scale measures the extent to which the person's main problem of fatigue interferes with work, home management, social and private leisure activities and relationships. A Likert scoring system, ranging from 0 to 8, is used. Responses range from 'not at all impaired' (0) to 'very severely impaired' (8). Scores on the five items are added and divided by the number of items to get a total score. The scale is reliable and valid and has also been used in a previous trial of CFS (Quarmby et al. 2007; Cella et al. 2011a).

Cognitive Behavioural Responses to Symptoms Questionnaire (CBRSQ; Skerrett & Moss-Morris, 2006; Knudsen et al. 2011)

This scale has seven subscales. Five of the subscales measure cognitive responses to symptoms: catastrophizing (e.g. 'I think that if my symptoms get too severe they may never decrease'), damage beliefs (e.g. 'Symptoms are a signal that I am damaging myself'), symptom focusing (e.g. 'When I experience symptoms, I think about them constantly'), fear avoidance beliefs (e.g. I am afraid that I will make my symptoms worse if I exercise') and embarrassment avoidance (e.g. 'I am embarrassed about my symptoms'). The other two subscales measure behavioural responses: avoidance behaviour (e.g. 'I tend to avoid activities that make my symptoms worse') and allor-nothing behaviour (e.g. 'I tend to do a lot on a good day and rest on a bad day'). The subscales are reliable and valid and were associated with fatigue and social adjustment in previous studies of CFS and multiple sclerosis (Skerrett & Moss-Morris, 2006; Knudsen et al. 2011.

#### Statistical analysis

Descriptive statistics for the 389 people who participated in the study are presented. Completers and drop-outs at discharge and at the 6-month follow-up were compared on baseline data using the t test and x test for homogeneity.

The analysis was conducted in two stages. In the first stage we investigated whether patients' scores changed during the study. We used general linear mixed models (see Brown & Prescott, 2006) to compare the outcome scores between the five measures at pre-treatment (baseline), discharge, and 3-, 6- and 12-month follow-ups. For each variable we used a mixed model with time as a fixed factor and an unstructured covariance matrix that allows unequal variances and covariances (correlations) between repeated measures. To account for the possible dependency due to therapy effects (in other words that patients treated by a particular therapist may respond in a similar manner and may no longer be assumed to act independently), we included therapist as a random factor in the model. If the time effect was significant, pairwise comparisons were performed. As an estimate of effect size we calculated the estimated mean difference between baseline and the 6-month follow-up divided by the baseline standard deviation.

To assess the sensitivity of our results to missing data we used multiple imputation (Little & Rubin, 2002). By using a large number of variables to impute missing measurements, the missing at random (MAR) assumption becomes more tenable than the mixed effect model approach (Little & Rubin, 2002). Variables used to impute missing values included gender, age, therapist and behavioural and cognitive variables at all five time points. Twenty data sets were imputed using the ICE procedure in Stata (Royston, 2005) and we reran the mixed effects model analyses.

#### Therapist effect

To quantify the effect of therapist on treatment outcome, we estimated the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) at the 6-month follow-up (Cella et al. 2011b). The ICC is the estimated proportion of therapists' explained variance, defined as the ratio of the variance attributable to the therapists to the total variance. To estimate the variances we used a conditional multi-level model with measurement at 6 months as the dependent variable, therapist as a random effect and baseline levels as a covariate to control for baseline differences. Bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap confidence intervals (CIs) are presented around estimates.

#### Mediation analysis

In the second stage, we performed a path analysis to assess possible mediating effects (Judd & Kenny, 1981; Baron & Kenny, 1986; MacKinnon & Luecken, 2008). Mediation is a hypothesized causal chain in which one independent variable X affects a mediating variable Y, which in turn affects the outcome variable Z. If the intervening mediator Y explains the correlation between X and Z, we have a full mediational model. If X still has an effect on Z after including the mediator Y in the model, the model is consistent with partial mediation.

For each of the two outcome variables (fatigue and social adjustment), we compared full and partial mediation processes for two proposed pathways: behaviour -> cognition -> outcome and cognition -> behaviour -> outcome. We used 'avoidance behaviour' as the behavioural response and 'fear avoidance beliefs' as the cognitive variable. We used the scores of the independent variable at discharge, of the mediator at the 3-month follow-up and scores of the dependent outcome variable at the 6-month follow-up. The temporal order was chosen because the mediation model assumes that the independent variable precedes and causes the mediator, which precedes and causes the dependent variable outcome (Kraemer et al. 2002). We expect that changes in the outcome variables are established during CBT and only small changes are expected after discharge from CBT. However, longitudinal mediation models with at least three waves of measurements are still preferred over cross-sectional models because they allow us to explore different temporal ordering of variables in the process, even if the changes are small (MacKinnon, 2008). Such multiwave models are important for model comparisons because it is not possible to compare quantitatively the strength of support for different models using a cross-sectional approach if the models are structurally equivalent. For example, the two models 'cognition is dependent on behaviour' and 'behaviour is dependent on cognition' are very different substantively; however, the fit of the models will be identical in a crosssectional study. In this situation, path analysis cannot resolve the issue of which model should be preferred. However, the temporal order with which the data are collected can often exclude the problem of assessing equivalent models because causal effects cannot travel backwards (Shipley, 2003). Even small changes after discharge should result in the same mediation process, which allows us to compare models with differences in the proposed temporal order using information criteria. If no changes occur after discharge, our mediation model would be identical to a cross-sectional model using measurements at discharge only and we would expect to see no differences in model fit of equivalent models. It should be noted that the longitudinal approach assumes that the mediational processes are the same during and after treatment.

Finally, for all variables we included a path from their baseline measure to control for baseline differences in the measures (ANCOVA approach; Mac-Kinnon, 2008).

#### Model selection

To assess the different models we used Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC), which attempts to select a parsimonious model that best explains the data with a minimum number of estimated parameters (Burnham & Anderson, 2002; Claeskens & Lid, 2008). AIC is a measure of the goodness of fit that includes a penalty for the number of variables estimated. AIC selects the best of several competing models as the one that predicts best in a new data set. The best model is the one with the lowest AIC. Unlike model selection based on null hypothesis testing, AIC model selection enables an evaluation of the quality of other models by assessing AIC-related measures (△AIC; Akaike weights and evidence ratio). AAIC; is the difference in AIC between model i and the best model. As a rule of thumb, a AAIC; value of<2 times the AIC; value of the best model has substantial support and should be considered with the best model. A ΔΑΙC¡ value>4 times the AIC; of the best model has substantially less support and models with a ΔAIC¡>10 times the AIC; of the best model can be omitted from further consideration (Burnham & Anderson, 2002). An Akaike weight is an estimate of the probability that model i is the best model among the candidate set of models. The evidence ratio for a given model i is the ratio of Akaike weights of the best model and of model i. Unlike Akaike weights, the evidence ratio of two models is independent of other candidate models.

Structural equation and path model assessments compare the fit of the predicted covariances matrix relative to the observed covariance matrix. This means that AIC model selection can only be used to compare non-nested models with the same set of observed variables. We therefore used the full set of observed variables in the analyses and fixed the paths that were not of interest to zero. For example, if we want to determine the AIC for the path model behaviour at discharge -> cognition at 3 months -> outcome at 6 months, we need to include the variables cognition at discharge, behaviour at 3 months and outcome at 6 months (and their baseline measures) in the model but constrain their paths to zero.

#### Model fit assessment

The goodness of fit of the models was further assessed by performing a test for lack of fit using the x goodness-of-fit statistic and assessing the Comparative Fit Index (CFI) and the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), which are recommended for smaller sample sizes (Fan et al. 1999; Kline, 2004). Support for good fit of a target model is obtained if the x goodness-of-fit test is not significant, the RMSEA value is<0.05 (adequate fit:<0.08) and the CFI is>0.95 (adequate fit:>0.90).

The final best models for fatigue and social adjustment are presented as path diagrams with standardized regression coefficients. We used Huber-White sandwich standard errors, which are robust against some failure to meet assumptions about normality and heteroscedasticity to establish CIs and statistical significance tests of direct, indirect and total (=direct +indirect) effect for each variable in the model.

#### Latent variable path model

The behavioural and cognitive variables can be assumed to measure more general underlying latent variables 'behavioural responses' and 'cognitive responses'. In the final exploratory analysis, we assessed whether the best model held for behavioural and cognitive variables in general by creating a composite score of the two behavioural variables (avoidance and all-or-nothing behaviour) and a latent variable for cognition using the five cognition variables (fear avoidance beliefs, catastrophizing, damage control, embarrassment avoidance and symptom focusing) as indicator variables. A latent variable for behaviour was not possible because of the small number of items. We obtained a composite score by standardizing the two variables by calculating the difference of a score and the mean of the baseline divided by the standard deviation of the baseline, and then adding up the two z scores for each individual (Cutter et al. 1999). The composite score is used as a proxy for the latent trait 'behaviour' and assumes equal contributions from each item to the latent trait. We reran the analyses of the best models using the composite score and the latent variable as the independent and mediating variables and fatigue and social adjustment respectively as the dependent outcome variable. Again, to control for baseline differences we included a path from their baseline measure for all manifest and latent variables. These paths are not shown in the figures to maintain clarity.

Multi-level modelling analyses were performed with Stata version 11.1 (StataCorp, 2007) and Amos 20 (Arbuckle, 2006) was used for path analysis. The userwritten R package lavaan (Rosseel, 2012) was used for calculating robust standard errors for the best path and the latent variable models.

## Results

#### Recruitment, demographics and follow-up attendance

Demographic data and information on the recruitment of subjects and participation in the study are summarized in Table 1. A total of 389 people (mean age 40.5 years, 82.1% white British, 72.5% women) participated in the study. Adherence to treatment, measured by the number of therapy sessions attended, ranged from 0 to 31 with a mean of 13.1. Of the 209 subjects attending therapy sessions, 95% attended more than five of these sessions. The pre-treatment session was attended by 340 (87.4%) people. Baseline data for the seven behavioural and cognitive variables were available for between 314 (avoidance behaviour) and 340 (embarrassment avoidance) people. The attendance rate decreased to 266 (68.4%) at post-treatment, 223 (57.3%) at 3 months, 195 (50.1%) at 6 months and 183 (47%) at 12 months after treatment. Thirty-six individuals (9.3%) did not attend any post-treatment or follow-up sessions.

education status) between 'refusers' and those who attended at least one follow-up session after treatment revealed a significant lower mean score in embarrassment avoidance behaviour (refusers: 14.3 versus others: 11.6 points, t338=2.71, p=0.007, Cohen's d=0.48) A similar comparison between attendees and drop-outs at 6 months revealed small differences in mean avoidance behaviour (non-attendees: 13.7 versus attendees: 12.5 points, t312=1.89, p=0.06, Cohen's d=0.21).

## Scale reliability

Cronbach's a ranged between 0.76 and 0.94 for all scales and subscales at baseline, confirming their internal consistency (for details see online Supplementary Table S1).

#### Longitudinal mixed model analysis

Descriptive mean scores and standard deviations for fatigue and social adjustment and for each subscale on the CBRSQ are presented in Supplementary Table S1.

## Fatigue and social adjustment (WASA)

The results of the mixed model analyses revealed significant decreases in mean fatigue and WASA scores from baseline to discharge (Fig. 1 and online Supplementary Table S2). The significant difference remained at all follow-up measures at 3, 6 and 12 months for fatigue. However, for social adjustment (WASA), a small increase from discharge to the 3-month followup was observed (p<0.05) and the mean score remained at a similar level afterwards. There were no significant changes in fatigue score after discharge. At 6 months the effect sizes were similar (fatigue: d=-0.57, WASA: d=-0.58).

## CBRSQ subscales

The results of the mixed model analyses revealed significant decreases in the mean scores from baseline to discharge on all five subscales of cognition (fear avoidance beliefs, catastrophizing, damage control, em barrassment avoidance and symptom focusing and on both subscales of behaviour (all-or-nothing and avoidance behaviour). There was a small significant further decrease from discharge to the 12-month follow-up in catastrophizing, embarrassment, symptom focusing and all-or-nothing behaviour (all p's<0.05). For most scales effect sizes were similar at the 6-month followup to those reported for fatigue and social adjustment (catastrophizing: d=- 0.55, symptom focusing: d= -0.49, all-or-nothing behaviour: d=- 0.61, avoidance behaviour: d=-0.69, fear avoidance beliefs d= -0.68, damage control: -0.6, but the embarrassment avoidance effect was somewhat smaller at d=- 0.37).

## Multiple imputation sensitivity analysis

The longitudinal multi-level modelling analyses were similar after multiple imputations for missing values, which suggests that the mixed model approach with missing data is robust.

## Therapist effect

To quantify the effect of therapist on treatment outcome we estimated the ICC at the 6-month follow-up. The therapist effect was estimated as zero for most measures. Only for fear avoidance beliefs and damage control was a small (~1%) but not significant effect observed (see Supplementary Table S2).

### Mediation analysis

Because there were no, or only negligible, therapist effects, these effects were not incorporated in the following analyses. The mediation analysis revealed that the path 'behaviour-> cognition-> outcome', with cognition as a mediator between behaviour and outcome, explained the data better than behaviour as a mediator between cognition and both outcome variables, fatigue and social adjustment (Table 2). For both fatigue and social adjustment, a partial mediation model was selected as the best model.

For fatigue, the partial model with fear avoidance beliefs as mediator between avoidance behaviour and fatigue as outcome had large AIC differences (6.3) compared to the path model where avoidance behaviour mediated fear avoidance beliefs. In addition, the evidence ratio suggests that the model with fear avoidance beliefs as a mediator is 23 times more likely to be the best model than the partial model with avoidance behaviour as a mediator (Table 2).

Similar results were obtained for the social adjustment models: the partial model with fear avoidance beliefs as mediator between avoidance behaviour and fatigue as outcome had an AIC 3.9 points lower and is seven times more likely to be the best model than the partial model with behaviour as a mediator.

Fig. 2a shows the best model for fatigue and social adjustment with standardized regression coefficients. The arrows reflect the hypothesized relationships between variables. Standardized regression coefficients are shown next to each path. This figure shows that avoidance behaviour at discharge was positively associated with fear avoidance beliefs at 3 months and fatigue and social adjustment at 12 months. Changes in the mediator 'fear avoidance beliefs' were also

positively associated with the outcome variables fatigue and social adjustment respectively. All direct, indirect and total effects were significant. Table 3 shows details of the results of the statistical analyses. Fit indices for the two path models were good for fatigue [x6=10.1, p=0.12, RMSEA=0.042 (95% CI 0-0.085), CFI=0.985] and adequate for social adjustment [x = 18.4, p = 0.002, RMSEA=0.079 (95% CI 0.04-0.12), CFI=0.964].

# Composite score and latent variable mediation model

The partial mediation models for fatigue and social adjustment were replicated using a composite score for behaviour and modelling cognition as a latent variable with the five cognitive response variables as indicator variables (Fig. 2b). The standardized direct and indirect effects were similar or slightly larger than those in the previous models and again significant (standardized indirect effect for fatigue: b=0.16, p= 0.012, for social adjustment: b=0.17, p=0.003, p values for all direct effects<0.01). Fit indices for two models were adequate [fatigue (x55=72.1, p=0.06, RMSEA= 0.076 (95% CI 0.05-0.10), CFI=0.90] and nearly adequate for social adjustment [x5=88.7, p=0.003, RMSEA=0.085 (95% CI 0.06-0.12), CFI=0.89].

#### Discussion

 In this study we assessed the theoretical foundations of a CBT model for CFS, namely that fearful cognitions would at least partially mediate the relationship between change in avoidance behaviour and illness outcomes (fatigue and disability). As expected from previous RCTs (White et al. 2011), which established

that CBT is an effective treatment for CFS, our study demonstrates persistent improvements in fatigue and social adjustment after routine CBT training. Changes in improvement were accompanied by similar changes in illness-related cognitive and behavioural responses. All changes remained on lower levels for 12 months. The results of the mediational analyses were consistent with our hypothesized model in which fear avoidance beliefs partially mediate the relationship between avoidance behaviour and fatigue and social adjustment respectively. There was little support for the alternative models with avoidance behaviour as a mediator between fear avoidance belief and fatigue and social adjustment respectively. However, the partial mediation effect suggests that other potential mediators should be considered in further studies. An exploratory latent trait model suggests that the observed partial mediation model generalizes to illness-related behavioural and cognitive traits.

Our results are consistent with previous findings that also suggest that cognitive processes are a mediator between behaviour and outcome. Wiborg et al. (2011) found that a decrease in symptom focusing on fatigue mediated the effect of CBT for CFS on fatigue and impairment. The measure of symptom focusing they used included items that could be construed as catastrophizing (e.g. 'When I feel fatigued I think that the fatigue will get worse'). In contrast to our findings, unexpectedly they did not find an effect of CBT on avoidance of activity and so did not examine whether change in avoidance mediated the effect of CBT on fatigue or impairment. The authors suggested that the needs of the pervasively passive patients were being more adequately addressed in recent trials so this modification in the treatment protocol may explain their findings. One of the key components of CBT in our study is behavioural activation, which consists of encouraging patients to adopt a more consistent approach to activity with a view to gradually increasing activity thereafter.

Given these findings, even greater emphasis should be placed on behavioural change in the early stages of treatment, which may result in greater subsequent cognitive change and superior treatment outcomes. There is some supporting evidence from other studies (e.g. the PACE trial; White et al. 2011), which suggests that GET is as effective as CBT. In GET, cognitions are not a specific focus of treatment but are likely to be changed indirectly. We will be reporting our investigations of mediational processes in the PACE trial in future papers. Other studies that measure mediational factors at mid-treatment, prior to the main outcomes, will help to clarify these issues.

There are considerable strengths to this study. We considered a large routine clinic sample and the measures are used routinely as they inform the therapist and ultimately the patient about progress. The specific cognitive and behavioural responses are targeted in therapy. The statistical methods used are robust and also have major advantages over simpler methods such as the Baron & Kenny (1986) approach or standard bootstrap extensions (Preacher & Hayes, 2004). In the case of missing data, path analysis models using full maximum likelihood estimation allow analysis of all available data with less restrictions on the missingness assumptions and more power than standard complete case analyses. Robust standard errors correct CIs and p values for some violations of the distribution assumptions, such as normality and heteroskedasticity. Finally, the empirical support for the different models was assessed using an informationtheoretic approach. Unlike model selection based on null hypothesis testing, AIC model selection enables an evaluation of the relative support in the observed data for each model by assessing AIC-related measures (Burnham & Anderson, 2002). It is therefore not restricted to evaluating a single model, where significance is measured against some arbitrary probability threshold and quantitative comparisons between models are not possible.

The strengths have to be set against the weaknesses. First, our study was not an RCT and as such did not allow us to formally assess whether the observed changes are due specifically to CBT. However, a previous RCT has shown that CBT induces changes in our described mediators (Wiborg et al. 2011). Second, mediation requires temporal precedence of the outcome by the mediator and of the mediator by the mediated variable. Our cohort allowed us to model the temporal order of the proposed and alternative mediation models, which strengthens the conclusions about the causal pathway. However, the time points of measurements were not frequent enough to detect changes in behavioural responses at different time points. The main changes in all measures occurred between baseline and discharge, with few changes occurring afterwards, so that true causality could not be proven. However, the small changes allowed us to select the path 'behaviour->cognition->outcome' as the better mediation model. Our model selection approach of longitudinal mediation models provides more evidence for causality than using traditional modelling approaches. Third, the standard mediation model makes the verifiable assumption that there is no unmeasured confounder between mediator and outcome (Emsley et al. 2010). The good fit indicates that the model is consistent with the data, although other models might account for the data equally. As with any other mediation analysis, the results should be interpreted with caution.

Future research should include measurement of the potential mediators at more regular intervals during and after therapy; this would allow assessment of causal pathways during the establishment of changes in addition to comparison of the pathways that mediate the sustainment of the treatment outcome. Multivariate latent growth curve models (MLGMs) could then be applied for testing mediation longitudinally, that is they model longitudinal change simultaneously across multiple variables while allowing one change process to predict another (Cheong et al. 2003; Duncan et al. 2006; Carey et al. 2010). As CBT was not compared to any other treatment, we cannot conclude that these mediators are specific to CBT. Ideally, a gold standard RCT would be used and controls for therapist time and attention would be included in the model. An RCT would also allow an estimation of the indirect effect in the presence of unmeasured confounders using instrumental variables (Emsley et al. 2010). Clearly there are mechanisms of change in the context of CBT that are not yet fully understood. Focusing on changing fear avoidance cognitions along with change in behaviour in the early phases of treatment may bring about more rapid change in the desired outcomes of fatigue and social adjustment. In this setting a detailed formulation of the patient's problems is usually offered to the patient and precedes a rationale for treatment. Invariably, the rationale for treatment includes the role of cognitive and behavioural responses in perpetuating symptoms and disability. As a consequence it can be difficult to disentangle the respective contribution of cognitive and behavioural mechanisms during treatment. However, the results of this study go some way in suggesting that it is change in fearful cognitions that mediates the relationship between change in avoidance behaviour and illness outcomes.

Psvchol. 7:1207. doi: 10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01207 In Spain, 44% of 14-18-year-olds have smoked, and 12.5% have smoked cigarettes in the last 30 days. Nicotine is one of the most addictive substances, and can lead to serious addiction in adulthood with adverse consequences to one's health. School plays a relevant role in health promotion and preventing risk behaviors such as tobacco consumption. Despite the fact that some school-based tobacco cessation and prevention interventions prove to be effective for their purposes, there is a lack of understanding as to why these programs succeed or fail. This longitudinal study aims to test the nicotine dependence (ND) as a mediator of Project EX's effect - a tobacco-use cessation program developed for high school youth to reduce tobacco consumption in scholars. Six high schools located in the Mediterranean coast were randomized for the participation of the program (Spanish version of Project EX) or a waiting-list group with baseline, immediate-posttest, and 12-month follow-up assessments. At baseline, 1,546 adolescents aged 14-21 years old (mean age: 15.28; SD = 1.20; 46% were women) were evaluated by self-administered tests on tobacco consumption and ND. A biomarker of smoke inhalation - a measurement of exhaled carbon monoxide (ECM) was used. Participants who were smokers (N = 501; 32%) were selected for this study. Mediation analyses were conducted using the PROCESS v2.12 macro for Windows. The significant criterion was p ≤ 0.05, and 5,000 samples were used for bias-corrected bootstrap confidence intervals. Results indicated that Project EX indirectly decreased the number of cigarettes smoked in the last month, the number of cigarettes smoked within the last 7 days, the number of daily cigarettes, and ECM level at 12-month follow up through decreasing the level of ND in the short-term. This is the first Spanish study that explores ND as a mediator of the long-term efficacy of Project EX to reduce tobacco consumption in adolescents. Results suggest that interventions that reduce ND at short-term are more likely to be successful to decrease tobacco use at long-term.

# INTRODUCTION

Tobacco consumption is the leading preventive cause of disease and early death in developed countries (World Health Organization [WHO], 2014). Teens who experiment with tobacco consumption later become regular users and progress to regular use of other more harmful substances (Botvin and Griffin, 2007). In recent years there has been a growing interest in interventions for teen smoking cessation, since this population comprises the most vulnerable group, as it is at adolescence when addiction starts (Abad and Ruiz-Juan, 2015).

In Spain, tobacco is the second most consumed addictive substance, according to the latest data from the National Drug Plan (Spanish Drugs Observatory, 2015). It is estimated that 44% of adolescents have smoked on at least one occasion, 35% have smoked in the last year, and 12.5% have smoked cigarettes in the last 30 days. Motivations that lead adolescents to smoke are diverse and include the interaction of genetic and environmental factors that favor the initiation, experimentation, and consolidation of a level of nicotine dependence (ND; Cogollo-Milanés and de La Hoz-Restrepo, 2010). Sensation seeking, low risk perception, peer acceptance, and smoking social component favor adolescents risk behaviors (Latorre et al., 2014; Cantó et al., 2015). Also, adolescents who start smoking at a young age have a higher ND (Balboa et al., 2011; Dierker et al., 2015), establishing it as the main factor maintainer of smoking behavior (Villalobos et al., 2015).

Nicotine dependence is considered a construct which brings cognitive, behavioral, and physiological symptoms that characterize compulsive consumption (Villalobos et al., 2015). Dependence level can be considered a continuous variable, scoring from 0 to 19, where scores from 0 to 2 is considered low dependence, scores 3-4 is low dependence, 5 is medium dependence, scores 6-7 is high dependence, and from 8 to 19 very high dependence (Fagerström, 1978; Prokhorov et al., 2000). In turn, these dependence levels are established as a risk factor in the onset of depressive symptoms and negative moods (Gonzalvez et al., 2015), as well as schizophrenia and alcoholism (Becoña and Míguez, 2004), so it is necessary to design interventions to prevent tobacco consumption.

Project EX (Sussman et al., 2004) is an empirically validated school-based smoking-cessation intervention for adolescents developed in the United States (California). The intervention focuses on personal skills (such as assertiveness training), coping withdrawal, and motivational factors. The Project EX clinic version shows consistently positive effects through several controlled studies in the U.S. to prevent and reduce tobacco consumption in adolescents. In order to evaluate the efficacy of the program in other cultures the program was implemented and evaluated in several other countries (Sussman, 2012). The first international pilot study completed was in Wuhan, China (Zheng et al., 2004), with an intent-to-treat 30-day quit rate of 11% at a four-month follow-up in adolescents aged 16-17 years. The second international pilot study was in Bashkortostan (Russia), with adolescents aged from 13 to 19 years. Intent-to-treat 30day quit rate was 7.5% in the program group versus 0.1% in the control group at a six-month follow-up (Idrisov et al.,

2013). In Spain, Project EX effectiveness has also shown a tobacco cessation in adolescents aged 13-19 years old, with a significantly higher 30-day intent-to-treat rate for adolescents who received the program (4.9%) compared to the control group (0%) (McCuller et al., 2006; Espada et al., 2015, 2016). Higher level of motivation to quit smoking was related to higher smoking quit rates; therefore, motivation to quit smoking is considered a mediator of the effects of the intervention.

Mediation analysis are especially useful to know how interventions work by identifying the variables that have the greatest influence on the effectiveness, and what other variables (on which the intervention has no impact) are particularly relevant to achieve the goal of the intervention, and they need to be revised to increase the effectiveness of the intervention (MacKinnon, 2008). McCuller et al. (2006) analyzed the role of motivation to quit smoking as a mediator variable of Project EX; however, more evidence is needed on what mechanisms are underlying this intervention's effects. This longitudinal study aims to test the ND as a mediator of Project EX's effectiveness to reduce tobacco consumption in adolescents from Spain.

# MATERIALS AND METHODS

# School Recruitment and Experimental Design

The study was approved by the institutional review board at Miguel Hernandez University, Spain. The education authorities were informed of the study goals, and authorization was requested by the parents, who were informed by letter and requested to provide written consent for their children to participate in the study. The written parental consent was provided to all minors participating.

We contacted a convenience sample of 45 schools from 17 towns in the Alicante, a province of Spain. A first meeting with the school boards was held to present the objectives of the intervention, and a total of six high schools from three cities [Elche (n = 4), Crevillente (n = 1), and San Vicente (n = 1)], agreed to participate. The schools recruited were randomly assigned to one of two experimental conditions: treatment or standard care (control).

A total of seventeen Spanish graduate students were interested in implementing the program. A researcher who was previously trained by the program developer provided training to all persons who finally delivered the program.

Two translators were responsible for the translation into Spanish of the original version of the Project EX program content. The final version was revised by two bilingual researchers working at the Miguel Hernandez University by comparing the English and Spanish versions. Before implementing the program, the Spanish version of Project EX was assessed in a focus group (n = 10 high school students). This evaluation was helpful to test the feasibility of the program content and verified that it was clearly understood and culturally appropriate. In addition to language adaptations, some changes were made in the Project EX program to adapt it to Spanish culture. The Project EX classroom program is closely adapted from the clinic program (Sussman

et al., 2001; Sun et al., 2007). The learning activities included strategies to quit smoking and learning skills for maintenance without smoking, with an interactive methodology based on motivation. The methodology of Project EX in Spain can be found somewhere else (Espada et al., 2015). The sessions and the objectives of the program are shown in Table 1.

### Participants

A total of 1,546 scholars aged 14-21 years old (mean age: 15.28; SD = 1.20; 46% were women) were evaluated by selfadministered tests. Adolescents who were smokers (N = 501; 32%) were selected for this study. Table 2 shows descriptive information about the sample.

## Data Collection and Measures

Participants were evaluated at pretest, posttest, and 12-month follow-up using paper-and-pencil questionnaire. Demographic variables included gender, age (years), nationality (born in Spain, or immigrated to Spain from another country), current living situation (with parents, live alone, other situation), and parents' education (mean response across father's (or stepfather's) and mother's (or stepmother's) educational levels based on categories derived from Hollingshead and Redlich (1958).

Smoking behavior was assessed with the fill-in-the blank items asking ""How many cigarettes have you smoked in the last month (30 days)?"" and ""How many cigarettes have you smoked in the last week (7 days)?"", and the assessment-day smoking behavior was measured with the item: ""Did you smoke tobacco today?"" The 8-item modified Fagerstrom Tolerance Questionnaire (mFTQ) was used to measure the level of ND (Prokhorov et al., 1996, 2000; Idrisov et al., 2013). An example of the item is: ""How soon after waking do you smoke your first cigarette?"" The higher sum score indicates the higher the participant's level of ND. Cronbach alpha for mFTQ in this sample was appropriate (a = 0.87). Expired CO was assessed using a breath CO monitor (Micro+ Smokerlyzer; Bedfont Technical Instruments, Kent, UK', accessed April 19, 2014) at

## Data Analysis

Descriptive statistics were computed for sociodemographic variables and main outcomes of the present study. Baseline differences between the control and experimental groups were calculated using T-test (quantitative variables) and Chi-square (x-) (qualitative variables). Statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS Statistics v23.0.

Mediation analyses were implemented with the SPSS PROCESS macro (Hayes, 2013). We used 5,000 samples for bias-corrected bootstrap confidence intervals; and the significant criterion was p ≤ 0.05. The single-mediator model described by Hayes (2013) was used (Figure 1). The predictor was a binary variable contrasting a tobacco-use cessation program (Project EX) with the control group (non-intervention). Primary outcomes were continuous variables: three self-reported measures - number of cigarettes smoked in the last month, number of cigarettes smoked within the last 7 days, and number of daily cigarettes -, and a biological measure (exhaled CO level). Analyses were controlled for sex, age, school, and baseline measures.

We assigned the mediator as changes in the level of ND. Indirect effect is estimated in simple mediation models as a product of regression weight linking X-Y through M (Ind 1) (Hayes, 2013). Mediation analyses were conducted for the four primary outcomes using a product-of-coefficient approach (Preacher and Hayes, 2008). The effect of the intervention on the level of ND (M) is represented in the path o; while the effect of the level of ND (M) on each primary outcome (Y) is represented in the path ß. If indirect effects do not include zero, there is a significant mediation.

had a significant impact on the level of ND (M) (path a) as shown in Table 4. This finding shows that adolescents involved in the intervention group informed lesser level of ND at posttest than those in the control group.

Path ß shows the existing significant relationship between the level of ND and all the main outcomes: number of cigarettes smoked in the last month (p = 0.04), number of cigarettes smoked within the last 7 days (p = 0.01); number of daily cigarettes (p = 0.01), and exhaled carbon monoxide (ECM) (CO) level (p = 0.009). In all the analyzed models, path ß shows that the higher level of ND (posttest) was related to higher number of cigarettes smoked in the last month, higher number of cigarettes

smoked within the last 7 days, higher number of daily cigarettes, and higher level of ECM (CO) level at 12-month follow-up.

The intervention positively reduced the number of cigarettes smoked in the last month (ACI = -22.44, -1.14), number of cigarettes smoked within the last 7 days (ACI = - 14.09, -1.65); number of daily cigarettes (ACI = -2.07, -0.25), and ECM (CO) level (ACI = - 1.29, -0.14) after 12-month period indirectly through reducing the level of ND.

# DISCUSSION

This work's objective was to test the ND as mediator of Project EX's effect to reduce tobacco consumption in adolescents from Spain. Findings show that the intervention had a significant impact on the level of ND short-time, and this variable was a mediator of the intervention's effect on several tobacco use measures. Compared to the control group, adolescents who received Project EX reduced their level of ND short-term, and they were more likely to report lesser tobacco use at 12-month follow-up, in terms of number of cigarettes smoked in the last month, number of cigarettes smoked within the last 7 days, number of daily cigarettes, and ECM level. In the present study, there was a significant relationship between the level of ND and all these main outcomes. The results are consistent with other studies that suggest that lower ND corresponds to lower tobacco consumption (González et al., 2016; Ruiz and Miranda, 2016).

Previously, McCuller et al. (2006) evaluated the effects of Project EX on changing motivation to quit smoking. It concludes that motivation to quit smoking is a plausible mediator of cessation program effects since higher level of motivation was statistically significantly related to higher smoking quit rates.

the present study, composed of Spanish adolescents, motivation was discarded as a mediator of the intervention's effects to reduce tobacco consumption because of the characteristics of the sample. At one-year follow-up of the smoking intervention program with Spanish adolescents there was a lack of general readiness to be involved in cessation programming. Evidence of this were the low percentage of schools that agreed to be involved initially, and the groups of young smokers that dropped out before the program started or after the first session (39.3%), as well as a high attrition rate. This results may be explained by the fact of the implementation was held after school, and students did not receive any incentive for participating in the present study (Espada et al., 2016). This suggests that participants were not highly motivated to participate in the program.

In Spain, Project EX is the only school-based tobacco cessation program whose effects have been proven to be positive to reduce tobacco consumption at 6 and 12 months (Espada et al., 2015, 2016). Furthermore, the assessment of expired CO by use of a breath CO monitor validates self-reported smoking responses. It is noteworthy that results were similar when the main outcome was assessed with self-report measures than when biological measures were used. Although ND was a mediator of the intervention's effects on every main outcome, it is curious that the coefficient of mediation was higher in the model with

cigarette consumption in the last month as a main outcome compared to the rest of measures. The coefficient of mediation decreased gradually as the main outcome implied a more limited time or more recent use of tobacco (last 7 days, daily). This effect may be explained by memory effect of the participants; in other words, it may be more easily remembered the number of daily cigarettes than the number of cigarettes smoked in the last month. Furthermore, it is important to note that the measurement of CO is a biological measure, and therefore, it is more accurate.

The results of this study have important implications for the tobacco cessation in Spanish adolescents. The results permit identifying the mechanisms involved in the effectiveness of a tobacco cessation program 12 months subsequent to its application. The present study has at least four strengths. This is the first Spanish study that explores ND as a mediator of the long-term efficacy of Project EX to reduce tobacco consumption in adolescents. A considerable sample size was used to explore this issue. The longitudinal design (including 12-month follow-up) is an important strength of the present study since there is a lack of this type of studies in prevention science. A biological measure was used, rather than only self-reported measures, which provides a more direct indicator of tobacco consumption in this population.

Nevertheless, the present study has some limitations. First, although the study involved a large sample, it is not from a varied geographical origin, so it is necessary to expand this study to other regions of the country. Second, U.S. and international survey data reveal that youth are aware of e-cigarettes and use of these products in this population is rapidly increasing (Durmowicz, 2014), and currently unregulated (Dutra and Glantz, 2014). In this study conventional tobacco consumption is evaluated, so it could be that adolescent consumers of e-cigarettes do not identify as tobacco consumers. Future studies on the consumption of tobacco should consider the use of this popular type of electronic nicotine delivery system.

Despite the limitations, this is the first Spanish study that explores ND as a mediator of the long-term efficacy of Project EX to reduce tobacco consumption in adolescents. However, more research is required for a better understanding of the success and/or failure of smoking cessation and prevention programs in adolescent population.

# 1. . Introduction

Suicide is a leading cause of death worldwide (World Health Organization [WHO], 2014). Adverse childhood experiences (ACE), and in particular childhood verbal/emotional abuse, physical abuse, and sexual abuse have been identified as having both a direct and indirect influence on the development of suicidal behaviors (Short and Nemeroff, 2014). Several pathways linking childhood abuse to suicidal behaviors have been proposed, including biological, psychological, and behavioral mechanisms (see Sachs-Ericsson et al. (2016)). The actual mechanisms underlying the associations are likely quite complex and may differ for violent (e.g., physical abuse and rape) and non-violent abuse (verbal/emotional abuse) (Gibb et al., 2001a, 2001b; Joiner et al., 2007; Sachs-Ericsson et al., 2006). Further, childhood abuse perpetrated by a family member, compared to a non-family member, is

associated with the greater risk for suicide attempts (Brezo et al., 2008). Better understanding of the mechanisms linking child abuse to suicidal behaviors may help to clarify etiological factors and contribute to both prevention and treatment efforts.

suicidality; violent abuse may contribute to the capacity for suicide. Interventions may need to be specifically

tailored to meet the distinct needs of individuals who have experienced past childhood abuse.

Violent childhood abuse is strongly associated with suicidal behaviors. For example, exposure to violent childhood abuse (e.g., physical, sexual abuse, and domestic violence) accounted for a substantial proportion of variance in predicting suicide attempts among women (50%) and men (33%) (Afifi et al., 2008). Several studies have documented a strong association between sexual abuse and suicide risk (see Short and Nemeroff (2014)). In a meta-analysis, Devries et al. (2014) found childhood sexual abuse to be associated with suicide attempts even when a range of different confounders were controlled. Norman et al. (2012) found violent forms of abuse to have a stronger association with suicide attempts compared to non-violent abuse.

CrossMark

Joiner et al. (2007) proposed a theoretical explanation as to why violent forms of childhood abuse have a stronger association with suicidal behaviors, compared to non-violent abuse. Specifically, they contend that the extent to which the abuse is experienced as violent or painful contributes to habituation and tolerance of pain. The interpersonal theory of suicide (Joiner, 2005; Van Orden et al., 2010) asserts that an individual will not die by suicide unless s/he has both the desire to die by suicide (through thwarted belongingness and feelings of burdensomeness), and the ability or capacity to do so (i.e., capability for suicide). Thus, the desire for suicide is not sufficient for a lethal attempt to occur-an individual must also have the capability for suicide. Through the process of repeatedly experiencing painful events, such as abuse, one accumulates such capacity. In a test of this theory, Joiner and colleagues (Joiner et al., 2007) found violent forms of childhood abuse (physical and rape) to have a stronger association with suicide attempts than non-violent abuse (e.g., verbal abuse, molestation).

Researchers have also documented an association between childhood non-violent verbal abuse and suicide attempts (Norman et al., 2012). Gibb et al. (2001a, 2001b) and Sachs-Ericsson et al. (2016) proposed that childhood verbal abuse may confer risk for suicidal behaviors indirectly through the development of maladaptive cognitive styles and negative self-schemas. When childhood abuse is verbal rather than sexual or physical-the child is more likely to develop negative inferential styles (Gibb et al., 2003a) because negative selfschemas are directly supplied by the abuser (e.g., ""you are worthless""). Such maladaptive cognitive processes are strongly linked to the development of depression and anxiety disorders (Gibb et al., 2004b, 2003b, 2001a, 2001b). Studies have demonstrated a link between childhood verbal abuse, the development of negative self-schemas, and an increase in psychiatric disorders (Alloy et al., 2006; Crossfield et al., 2002). Further studies have demonstrated that negative cognitive styles mediate the association between verbal abuse and suicidal ideation (Gibb et al., 2001b).

## 2. Abuse, psychiatric disorders, and suicidality

One established pathway between childhood abuse and suicidal behavior is through psychiatric disorders. Childhood abuse experiences-both violent and non-violent-are powerful risk factors for the development of mental health problems. Afifi et al. (2008) found that the estimated attributable fractions for psychiatric disorders related to having experienced any violent form of childhood abuse (sexual, physical abuse, domestic violence) ranged from 22% to 32% among women and 20% to 24% among men. In a meta-analysis, Norman et al. (2012) found verbally abused individuals to have a three-fold higher risk of developing depression or anxiety than non-abused individuals. In turn, these psychiatric disorders are strongly associated with an increased risk of suicidal behaviors (Bertolote et al., 2004; Nock et al., 2010).

Researchers have examined the mediating role of psychiatric disorders in the abuse-suicide attempt association. Dube et al. (2001) found that illicit drug use, depressed affect, and alcoholism partially mediated the relationship between ACEs (e.g., verbal, physical, and sexual abuse; parental substance abuse, mental illness, incarceration; domestic violence, parental loss) and suicide attempts. In a prospective school-based sample, researchers found that disruptiveness and anxiousness partially accounted for the ACEs-suicide attempt association (Wanner et al., 2012). In a large prospective study of children from Africa, researchers found exposure to ACEs (e.g., parental illness/ death, verbal abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse and community violence) predicted later suicidality (suicide attempts, planning, and ideation); further, suicide risk was mediated by mental health and substance disorders (Cluver et al., 2015).

# 3. The current study

Data for the current study were obtained from the two waves of the National Comorbidity Surveys (NCS-1 [baseline] and NCS-2 [10-year follow-up]). Controlling for several baseline risk factors, we examined the effects of retrospective reports of childhood violent abuse (parental physical abuse or rape by a family member) and non-violent childhood abuse (parental verbal abuse) in the prediction of suicide attempts over a ten-year period. Whereas we anticipated both violent and non-violent abuse to predict suicide attempts, we expected the association to be stronger for violent abuse. Further, we expected the association between non-violent verbal abuse and suicide attempts to be indirect and mediated by psychiatric disorders. Whereas there have been a few studies comparing the impact of violent and non-violent childhood abuse on suicidal behaviors, this is one of the few longitudinal studies examining differential mechanisms linking abuse subtypes (i.e., violent versus non-violent) to suicide attempts. Moreover, the present study is incremental in its use of the interpersonal theory of suicide (Joiner, 2005) to explain why the relationship between abuse subtypes and suicidal behaviors differ.

#### 4. Method

#### 4.1. Internal Review Board (IRB)

Approval for the secondary data analyses of the NCS data sets was obtained from the University's IRB of the first author's University's affiliation.

# 5. Participants

#### 5.1. NCS-1

The baseline NCS-1 is a nationwide epidemiological study of over 8000 respondents (Kessler, 1994). A representative sub-sample of participants (N=5877; aged 15-59, mean=33.2, SD=10.7) were interviewed with the entire psychosocial survey which was designed to assess the prevalence of DSM III-R (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 1987) psychiatric disorders.

#### 5.2. NCS-2

NCS-2 is a 10-year follow-up that included 62% of the original NCS-1 respondents (Kessler, 2013). Of the 5463 respondents successfully traced, 166 were deceased and 5001 were re-interviewed, for a conditional response rate of 87.6%. Pertinent to the current study, and as reported by Borges et al. (2008), there was no difference between NCS-2 respondents and non-respondents in their reports of suicide-related variables at the baseline assessment (x6/2=7.08, p=.313).

#### 6. NCS-1 Baseline

#### 6.1. Procedures

Interviews were conducted by highly trained and closely supervised interviewers. To improve accuracy, there was a life review section at the beginning of the interview. Participants were provided with instructions designed to improve recall (Kessler et al., 2000) and validity of the self-reported abuse items (Sachs-Ericsson et al., 2005).

#### 6.2. Demographics

Participants completed a demographic questionnaire to assess age, sex, race, and education.

# 6.3. DSM III-R Diagnoses

At baseline, participants' DSM III-R psychiatric diagnoses were assessed using the semi-structured Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) (WHO, 1990). The reliability and validity of the CIDI has been well established (Janca et al., 1992; Kessler et al., 1995; Wittchen, 1994). The baseline DSM diagnoses (past and present) included in the current study were as follows: major depression, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), panic, and substance use disorders.

# 6.4. Baseline suicidality

Respondents were asked about lifetime experiences of suicidal ideation (""Have you ever seriously thought about committing suicide?"", No=0, Yes=1), suicide plans (""Have you ever made a plan for committing suicide?"", No=0, Yes=1), and suicide attempts (""Have you ever attempted suicide?"", No=0, Yes=1). These three dichotomous variables were used as control variables in the logistic regression analyses.

# 6.5. Baseline childhood abuse experiences

To be consistent with much of the literature assessing the association of childhood abuse to subsequent negative outcomes (Dube et al., 2001), a dichotomous variable (e.g., Yes/No) was derived for each type of abuse: non-violent (parental verbal abuse) and violent abuse (parental physical abuse and/or rape by a family member). The verbal and physical abuse items were embedded in the childhood history section of the NCS-1. Childhood rape was assessed in the PTSD section. We limited the assessment of childhood abuse to family members, since childhood abuse by a family member-compared to non-family member-is associated with the greater risk for suicide attempts (Brezo et al., 2008).

## 7. Non-violent childhood abuse

## 7.1. Parental verbal abuse

Participants were asked: ""When you were growing up, how often did someone in your household [parent/step-parent] do any of the things on this List to you: (Insulted or swore, Sulked or refused to talk, Stomped out of the room, Did or said something to, Threatened to hit, Smashed or kicked something in anger)."" The response scale was as follows: (often=3, sometimes=2, rarely=1, or never=0)'? A dichotomous variable was then derived: never was coded (No=0), whereas often, sometimes, and rarely were coded (Yes=1).

#### 8. Childhood violent abuse

# 8.1. Parental physical abuse

Participants were provided a list of specific behaviors related to physical abuse, and asked how often any of the things on the list happened to them when they were growing up in their family and who in the family perpetrated the abuse (e.g., parent/step-parent). These items included: Kicked, Bit or hit with a fist, Hit or tried to hit with something, Beat up, Choked, Burned or Scalded. The response scale was as follows: (often=3, sometimes=2, rarely=1, or never=0)? A dichotomous variable was then derived: never was coded (No=0), whereas often, sometimes, and rarely were coded (Yes=1).

# 8.2. Rape by family member before age 15 years

The PTSD section included an item about being raped. Specifically, participants were asked if they were raped (Someone had sexual

intercourse with you when you did not want to by threatening you or using some degree of force). Respondents who reported that they had been raped by a relative before the age of 15 were coded (Yes=1), if not the participant was coded (No=0).

#### 8.3. Any violent abuse

A variable was derived to represent the occurrence of any violent abuse. Thus, if the participant reported parental physical abuse and/or rape by a family member, the participant was coded as (Yes=1), for Any Violent Abuse. If not, the participant was coded (No=0).

#### 9. Other indices of adverse childhood experiences

# 9.1. Parental psychiatric symptoms

Participants were asked about psychiatric symptoms of each biological parent. Psychiatric symptoms included an extensive list of symptoms of depression and anxiety (i.e., internalizing symptoms). Symptoms were assessed using the Family History Research Diagnostic Criteria (Andreasen et al., 1977), shown to have good interrater reliability (Zimmerman et al., 1988). Four variables representing the number of symptoms reported for the internalizing disorders and externalizing disorders for Mother and Father, were derived.

# 9.2. Early parental loss

One variable representing early parental loss was derived. Participants were asked several questions regarding their early family life to determine whether the participant had experienced any early parental loss (due to death of parent, divorce, or abandonment) before the age of 15. If the participant had experienced any early loss of a parent the participant was coded (Yes=1) for early loss of parent. If not, the participant was coded (No=0) for early loss of parent. Thus we used only one variable to represent any early parental loss.

# 9.3. Family-of-origin economic functioning

Participants were asked to compare their family of origin's financial status during most of their childhood to the average family in their community, on a scale from 1 (better off) to 5 (a lot worse off).

#### 10. NCS-2 follow-up

## 10.1. Suicidal attempt during the ten-year follow-up

The questions assessing suicidality at follow-up were analogous to those at baseline. For the purpose of the current study, we focused only on suicide attempts, since this variable is more proximal to risk of death by suicide. Participants were asked if they had made a suicide attempt at any time during the follow-up period (i.e., between NCS-1 and NCS-2; Yes=1, No=0).

# 10.2. DSM-IV diagnoses

DSM-IV disorders (APA, 2000) that occurred during the decade between the interviews (e.g., NCS-1 and NCS-2) were assessed using Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID)(Kessler et al., 2000). The persistence of baseline disorders and/or the onset of new disorders was assessed using a life-review calendar (Belli, 1998). Disorders included in the current study are as follows: substance disorders (e.g., alcohol/drug), general anxiety disorder, panic disorder, major depressive disorder, and PTSD.

In conducting the bootstrapping mediation analyses described below, we constructed a variable that represented the count of the number of NCS-2 DSM-IV disorders. This count variable was examined

as the mediator of the association between abuse experiences and suicide attempts.

# 11. Data analyses

First, descriptive statistics for the sample as a whole were examined, followed by comparisons among participants by abuse status (e.g., no abuse, non-violent abuse only, and any violent abuse). We then conducted a logistic regression analysis to determine the relationship between the childhood abuse variables and covariates in the prediction of suicide attempts. Finally, we tested two separate mediation models to determine if the number of the NCS-2 DSM-IV disorders mediated the relationship between the abuse-type (non-violent and violent abuse) and suicide attempts. Mediation was formally tested using bootstrapped mediation analyses with the PROCESS SPSS macro (Hayes and Scharkow, 2013; Preacher and Hayes, 2008, 2004),

# 12. Results

# 12.1. Sample characteristics

By design, the participants (N=5001) were evenly divided by sex. The mean age at follow-up was 44 (SD=13.0) years. The majority of the sample was Caucasian (75.5%). Baseline rates of suicidal behaviors have been reported previously (Borges, 2008) for this sample: (13.3%) lifetime suicidal ideation, (4.0%) suicide plan, and (2.2%) suicide attempt.

ACEs variables are described in Table 1. Participants' reports of parental verbal abuse were relatively high (48.7%). Among the sample, 6.9% reported experiencing parental physical abuse. Childhood rape perpetrated by a family member was reported by 0.8% of the sample. Among the participants, 7.4% reported experiencing either physical abuse and/or childhood rape. The vast majority of the participants who experienced violent abuse also experienced parental verbal abuse (86.1%).

Among the participants, 21.8% reported early parental loss. The distribution of family of origin income was skewed such that a majority indicated that their status was relatively 'better off than most' (see Table 1). Table 1 also reports the mean symptom counts for mother and father's internalizing and externalizing symptoms.

## 12.2. NCS-2 suicide attempts

The rates for suicide attempts at follow-up, as well as the NCS-2 DSM-IV disorders, are listed by abuse category (e.g., none, non-violet, violent) in Table 2. Among the sample, 108 individuals (2.2%) reported

a suicide attempt. Among these participants, a sizable minority (39.8%) had reported, at baseline, a suicide attempt earlier in life (e.g., before NCS-1).

As noted, we expected both non-violent and violent abuse to be associated with a subsequent suicide attempt. However, we expected participants who experienced violent abuse would have a higher likelihood of suicide attempts compared to those who experienced only non-violent abuse. Suicide rates were as follows: No-abuse (1.3%), Non-violent verbal abuse (2.1%), and Violent abuse (7.8%). Controlling for age, sex, and education, analyses revealed that participants who experienced either non-violent (ß=.58, SE=.24, Wald=6.13, p=.013, OR=1.79, CI=1.13-2.83) or violent abuse (ß=1.66, SE=.27, Wald=37.36, p <. 001, OR=5.26, CI=3.09-8.95) were significantly more likely to report a subsequent suicide attempt than those with no abuse. Moreover, participants who experienced violent abuse were even more likely to report a subsequent suicide attempt than those who experienced non-violent abuse (ß=1.08, SE=.25, Wald=18.46, p < . 001, OR=2.94, CI=1.80-4.81).

# 12.2.1. Temporal relationship of the follow-up NCS-2 DSM psychiatric disorder and suicide attempts

The occurrence of NCS-2 DSM-IV disorders and the occurrence of suicide attempts were obtained for the same 10-year follow-up period. Data were obtained in such a manner that it was difficult to identify the temporal sequence between the NCS-2 DSM disorders and the suicide attempts. In examining each of the 108 participants for whom there was a suicide attempt, all but 14 participants had at least one or more

a Demographics: Sex (Female=1, Male=2), younger age, and fewer years of education predicted suicide attempt.

DSM diagnoses during the follow-up period. The vast majority of these participants reported the onset of a DSM disorder before the suicide attempt, as well has having an episode of a DSM disorder after the suicide attempt. However, from the available data we could not determine whether the participant had a current DSM disorder at the exact time of the suicide attempt.

# 12.2.2. Regression analyses

We performed logistic regression analyses including both types of childhood abuse (non-violent and violent) in the prediction of Wave 2 suicide attempts. The analyses are summarized in Table 3. On the first step, female sex, younger age, and fewer years of education predicted suicide attempts. On the next step, the type of abuse (violent and nonviolent) along with each of the other ACEs (e.g., fathers and mother's externalizing and internalizing psychiatric symptoms, family-of-origin income, and early parental loss) was entered into the model. Both violent and non-violent abuse predicted suicide attempts even after controlling for the other ACEs. Specifically, parental verbal abuse (ß=.571, SE=.23, Wald=6.2, p=.013, OR=1.8, CI=1.1-2.7) and parental physical abuse and/or relative rape (e.g., violent abuse) were associated with suicide attempts (ß=.898, SE=0.26, Wald=11.92, p=.001, OR=2.5, CI=1.5-4.1). After controlling for the demographics and other ACEs, in examining the Odds Ratios (OR), notably participants who experienced non-violent verbal abuse were 1.8 times more likely to have a suicide attempt during follow-up; participants who experienced violent abuse were 2.5 times more likely to experience a suicide attempt. Other ACEs associated with suicide attempts included mother's externalizing symptoms (ß=.091, SE=.042, Wald=4.8, p=.03, OR=1.09, CI=1.0-1.2) and early parental loss (ß=.487, SE=.22, Wald=5.1, p=.03, OR=1.63, CI=1.1-2.5). On the next step, we entered baseline suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts; each was predictive of suicide attempts. As shown in Table 3, notable are the high ORs associated with baseline suicidal thoughts, plans and attempts (e.g., OR=3.81, OR=9.82, OR=15.89, respectively). With the inclusion of the baseline suicide variables, non-violent verbal abuse was no longer related to suicide attempts: however, violent abuse remained a predictor. On the next step, we included the baseline psychiatric disorders; none were related to attempts. On the final step, we included the specific NCS-2 disorders (e.g., substance disorders, major depression, general anxiety, PTSD, panic disorder, and social anxiety). We found substance disorders, major depression, and general anxiety to be associated with suicide attempts. Examining the ORs associated with each significant NCS-2 disorder (see Table 3), participants with NCS-2 disorders were 2-3 times more likely to have a suicide attempt during follow-up. Noteworthy, even after all of the variables were included in the analyses, violent abuse remained significantly related to suicide attempt. (ß=0.808, SE=0.29, Wald=7.55, p=.006, OR=2.24, CI=1.26-3.99).

Of note, analyses were repeated using continuous, standardized indicators of the severity of each abuse variable (Physical and Verbal abuse: often=3, sometimes=2, rarely=1, never=0; Rape: never=0, once=1, repeated=2). These continuous variables representing abuse severity weakened the odds ratio effect sizes. Thus, we have presented only the dichotomous variables analyses to highlight maximal effect sizes.

# 12.3. Mediation analyses

The role of the number of NCS-2 DSM disorders in mediating the relationship between abuse type (violent and non-violent) and suicide attempts was formally tested using bootstrapped mediation analyses (Hayes and Scharkow, 2013; Preacher and Hayes, 2008, 2004) and controlling for the baseline covariates (e.g., demographics, other ACEs, baseline DSM disorders, and baseline suicidal behaviors).

# 12.3.1. Non-violent abuse

In conducting the mediation analyses, we found non-violent abuse (e.g., verbal abuse) predicted the number of NCS-2 DSM disorders (ß=.07, t=2.7, p <.01, CI=0.02-0.13) even after controlling for the other baseline covariates and violent abuse. Secondly, we found the proposed mediator (number of NCS-2 DSM disorders) to be associated with suicide attempts (ß=.63, z=8.9. p < .01, CI=0.49 5-0.76). Finally, once the number of NCS-2 DSM disorders were entered into the model controlling for the covariates and violent abuse, the direct effect of nonviolent verbal abuse was no longer significant (CI=-0.347-0.476). However, the indirect effect was significant as the bootstrap estimated confidence interval (CI) did not include zero (CI=0.0126-0.0819). Thus, the analyses confirmed that the number of NCS-2 DSM disorders fully mediated the relationship between non-violent verbal abuse and suicide attempts.

# 12.3.2. Violent abuse

Bootstrapped mediation analyses demonstrated that there was a direct effect of violent abuse on subsequent suicide attempts (ß=.52, z=2,1, p=.036, CI=0.0348-1.009) even after controlling for all of the baseline covariates and non-violent verbal abuse. Whereas violent abuse predicted the number of NCS-2 disorders (the potential mediator), there was no significant indirect effect through the NCS-2 DSM psychiatric disorders because the bootstrap confidence interval included zero (CI=-.10–.0514).

In sum, whereas each type of abuse (violent and non-violent) predicted suicide attempts, the association between violent abuse and suicide was stronger. Secondly, whereas the association between violent abuse and suicide attempts was direct, the influence of the non-violent verbal abuse was indirect, and it exerted its influence through the DSM disorders that occurred during the follow-up period.

# 13. Discussion

Numerous studies have documented the pernicious effects of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), including abuse, on adult suicidal behaviors (Brodsky and Stanley, 2008; Mortier et al., 2015; Sachs-Ericsson et al., 2016; Short and Nemeroff, 2014). The processes linking childhood abuse to suicide are likely complex (Sachs-Ericsson et al., 2016) and different mechanisms may link childhood violent abuse (e.g., physical abuse or rape) and non-violent abuse (e.g., verbal abuse) to suicidal behaviors (Gibb et al., 2001b; Joiner et al., 2007; Sachs-Ericsson et al., 2006).

The findings of the current study strongly suggest a differential weight in the negative impact of non-violent versus violent ACEs on suicide attempts, representing an advance in delineating mechanisms of the ACE phenomenon. In the current study, we found both childhood violent and non-violent abuse to predict suicide attempts over the course of a ten-year follow-up period; however, the rate of attempts was considerably higher among participants who experienced violent abuse compared to non-violent abuse (7.8% vs. 2.1%). Using bootstrapping mediation analyses, we found the number of psychiatric disorders occurring during the follow-up period fully mediated the association between non-violent verbal abuse and subsequent suicide attempts; however, the psychiatric disorders did not mediate the association between the violent abuse and suicide attempts.

# 13.1. Violent forms of childhood abuse and suicidality

Consistent with our findings, others have suggested that childhood sexual and physical abuse have a stronger association to suicidal behaviors compared to non-violent abuse (Bruffaerts et al., 2010; Hardt et al., 2008; Joiner et al., 2007). In this regard, the interpersonal theory of suicide (Joiner, 2005; Van Orden et al., 2010) may help elucidate some of our findings. Conceptually, childhood abuse experiences may contribute to each of the three components of the interpersonal theory of suicide (e.g., belongingness, burdensomeness, and capability for suicide); however, violent forms of abuse may more specifically enhance the capability for suicide. Dimensions of the capability for suicide include a lowered fear of death and elevated physical pain tolerance-both of which are amplified by exposure to physical abuse or rape (Joiner et al., 2007). Indeed, in light of the theory's assertion that habituation to pain and fear is implicated in suicide risk, it follows that more severe and painful forms of abuse, which serve to accelerate the habituation process, may place an individual at greater risk for lethal suicide attempts than less violent forms of abuse.

# 13.2. Non-violent abuse, psychiatric disorders and suicidality

We also found non-violent, verbal abuse to predict suicide attempts. However, the verbal abuse-suicide attempt association was fully mediated by the number of the NCS-2 psychiatric disorders. In establishing mediation, we demonstrated that the non-violent verbal abuse predicted the number of psychiatric disorders (occurring during follow-up), and in turn these psychiatric disorders were associated with suicide attempts.

Other studies have suggested that the effect of childhood abuse on suicidal behaviors may occur, in part, through the development of negative self-schemas and attributions (Crossfield et al., 2002; Gibb and Abela, 2008). Several studies have demonstrated a link between childhood verbal abuse, the development of negative self-schemas, and an increase in psychiatric disorders (Alloy et al., 2006; Crossfield et al., 2002; Gibb, 2002; Gibb et al., 2004a; Sachs-Ericsson et al., 2006). For example, Sachs-Ericsson and colleagues (Sachs-Ericsson et al., 2006) found self-criticism to fully mediate the relationship between parental verbal abuse and internalizing (depression, anxiety) symptoms; in contrast, self-criticism was only a partial mediator of the relationship between the other types of abuse (i.e., sexual and physical) and internalizing symptoms.

Negative self-conceptualizations, such as self-criticism, may develop as the child attempts to understand why such parental abusive experiences are happening to him or her (Gibb, 2002). Indeed, researchers (Rose and Abramson, 1992) suggest that when the abuse is verbal (rather than sexual or physical), the child may develop a negative self-schema because the negative self-cognitions are explicitly supplied to the child by the parent (e.g., ""you are worthless, you will never amount to anything, I wish you were never born""). These types of cognitions may play an important role in the abuse-suicide attempt association. In an examination of this theory, Gibb et al. (2001a, 2001b) found verbal abuse-but not physical or sexual abuse-to be uniquely related suicidal ideation across a 2.5-year follow-up in college students. Further, it was the participant's negative cognitive styles and average levels of hopelessness (see Abramson et al., 1998) that partially mediated this relationship.

#### 13.3. Psychiatric disorders and suicidality

We found several psychiatric disorders (e.g., substance disorders, major depression, and general anxiety) occurring during the follow-up period to be associated with suicide attempts. Importantly, after controlling for baseline suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts, the bɑseline (current, past history) psychiatric disorders had no predicative power. Rather, it was the presence of the psychiatric disorders during the ten-year follow-up period that were associated with suicide attempts. In this regard, researchers have found that the vast majority of individuals who die from suicide had a current psychiatric disorder at the time of their death (Cavanagh et al., 2003).

Childhood abuse experience may increase suicidal behavior through the emergence, persistence, and reoccurrence of psychiatric disorders (Nemeroff, 2016). Among individuals who have psychiatric disorders, those with a history of abuse have a more difficult, chronic course, and respond less well to treatment (Lu et al., 2008; Nemeroff, 2016) that contributes to the persistence of psychiatric disorders. Such persistence may be an important aspect of the association between child abuse and

suicide. The persistence of disorders may be related to the effect of early abuse on the developing brain. Early chronic trauma affects the developmental trajectory of the brain, leading to the dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) (Heim et al., 2008), increasing vulnerability for psychiatric disorders (Heim et al., 2010; Nemeroff, 2016) and to suicidality (Heim et al., 2008; Pompili et al., 2010).

#### 13.4. Future Directions

It would be beneficial for future researchers to investigate how abuse-type (e.g. violent, non-violent) may differentially affect components of suicide risk, such as the capability for suicide. Moreover, future research should also consider that violent behavior, including parental physical abuse as well as self-harming behavior, appears to be influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors (Smith et al., 2012). Furthermore, whereas the experience of violent abuse may specifically increase an individual's capability for suicide, we contend that childhood abuse (regardless of sub-type) likely conveys to the child that she or he is somehow inferior, a burden, and unwanted; thus, contributing to feelings of burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness-components of the 'desire to die by suicide' identified in the interpersonal theory of suicide (Joiner, 2005; Van Orden et al., 2010). Whereas it remains unknown how to reduce an individual's 'capability for suicide,' there may be ways to prevent further habituation to pain, and provide interventions to reduce perceptions of thwarted belongingness and burdensomeness. Future case conceptualization and interventions may be better informed by further identification of the mechanisms linking ACEs to suicidal behaviors. In addition to the treatment of underlying psychiatric disorders, these interventions may need to be specifically tailored to meet the distinct needs of individuals who have experienced past childhood abuse, especially when considering that psychiatric disorders among individuals with abuse history are more resistant to treatment. It will be important to investigate if there are other such factors to consider in developing interventions to decrease suicide risk among individuals who experienced childhood abuse.

# 13.5. Limitations

Consistent with many past studies (Kalmakis and Chandler, 2015), the current study relied on retrospective self-reports of childhood abuse. Retrospective reports of ACEs have been found to be generally stable over time (Dube et al., 2004). Whereas false positives are rare, there are significant concerns regarding false negatives (Hardt and Rutter, 2004). Thus, the probability of under-reporting of abuse in the current study should be taken into account. Additionally, definitions of each specific type of abuse have varied from study to study, making direct comparisons difficult. For example, in the current study we did not include some measures assessed in the original ACEs studies on suicide (see Dube et al., 2001), such as household member incarceration or witnessing of domestic violence. These limitations should be considered.

Further, we defined the mediator as the sum of the NCS-2 DSM disorders. Future studies may wish to examine the mediating effects of specific DSM disorders, and consider the use of clinical samples in which rates of diverse diagnoses and suicide attempts are high. We should also consider the time frame and the process by which the NCS-2 DSM disorders and suicide attempts were assessed at follow-up. For participants who had a suicide attempt during the follow-up period, we determined that the vast majority reported having a NCS-2 DSM-IV disorder before the attempt. However, from the available data we could not determine whether or not the participant had a current DSM disorder at the exact time of the suicide attempt. This limitation should be considered while interpreting the results. Moreover, we did not have a measure of the capability for suicide, and instead inferred that the

direct association of violent abuse to suicide attempts was related to the increase in acquired capability-a theoretically consistent relationship. We also did not have measures of thwarted belongingness or burdensomeness. Such measures would have substantially clarified the mechanisms linking specific types of childhood abuse to suicide risk. Finally, it is important to consider that most of the participants who experienced violent abuse also experienced verbal abuse. We know from other studies that as the number of ACEs one experiences increases, so too does the number of suicide attempts (Dube et al., 2001). We cannot rule out the possibility that this cumulative effect contributed to the stronger association between violent abuse and suicide attempts, compared to non-violent abuse.

# 14. Conclusions

The mechanisms linking childhood abuse experiences to adult suicidal behavior are complex, affecting interrelated biological and psychological domains. Non-violent, parental verbal abuse may contribute to a negative self-schema and the development of psychiatric disorders that in turn contribute to suicidal behaviors. Violent abuse may contribute to the acquired capacity for suicidal behavior.

Background. Childhood emotional maltreatment (CEM) increases the likelihood of developing an anxiety disorder in adulthood, but the neural processes underlying conferment of this risk have not been established. Here, we test the potential for neuroimaging the adult brain to inform understanding of the mechanism linking CEM to adult anxiety symptoms.

Method. One hundred eighty-two adults (148 females, 34 males) with a normal-to-clinical range of anxiety symptoms underwent structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging while completing an emotion-processing paradigm with facial expressions of fear, anger, and happiness. Participants completed self-report measures of CEM and current anxiety symptoms. Voxelwise mediation analyses on gray-matter volumes and activation to each emotion condition were used to identify candidate brain mechanisms relating CEM to anxiety in adulthood.

Results. During processing of fear and anger faces, greater amygdala and less right dorsolateral prefrontal (dIPFC) activation partially mediated the positive relationship between CEM and anxiety symptoms. Greater insula activation to fear also partially mediated this relationship, as did greater ventral anterior cingulate (ACC) and less dorsal ACC activation to anger. Responses to happy faces in these regions did not mediate the CEM-anxiety relationship. Smaller right dIPFC gray-matter volumes also partially mediated the CEM-anxiety relationship.

Conclusions. Activation patterns of the adult brain demonstrate the potential to inform mechanistic accounts of the CEM conferment of anxiety symptoms. Results support the hypothesis that exaggerated limbic activation to negative valence facial emotions links CEM to anxiety symptoms, which may be consequent to a breakdown of cortical regulatory processes.

# Introduction

Anxiety disorders are an insidious public health problem with a high prevalence and a substantial burden of suffering (Mendlowicz & Stein, 2000; Kessler et al. 2005), and great effort has been directed towards identifying and probing neural substrates responsible for the development of excessive anxiety. The majority of studies have focused on descriptive characterization

(Email: gfonzo@stanford.edu)

of dysfunctional brain substrates in participants already manifesting anxiety disorders (Paulus, 2008). Although such studies are useful in directing the focus of research towards relevant brain regions, they are unable to drive inference concerning neural mechanisms which underlie the etiology of clinical anxiety. Understanding the mechanisms by which mental illness manifests has emerged as a major focus of scientific interest, and particularly so in the framework of the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC; Insel et al. 2010; Insel, 2014), which emphasizes the establishment of mechanistic relationships by which disruptions in one or more specified constructs results in symptoms or impairment (Cuthbert, 2014). To address

this critically important issue, it is crucial to move beyond a descriptive focus on end-state neural abnormalities towards testing hypothesized models of neural mechanisms that putatively lead to the manifestation of anxiety disorders.

A useful method to facilitate mechanistic inference is through study of developmental risk factors known to predispose individuals to the later manifestation of clinical anxiety. As many mental illnesses can be viewed as neurodevelopmental disorders (Cuthbert, 2014), understanding how particular known risk factors interact with the developing brain to result in intermediate phenotypes and eventual full manifestation of pathology can provide a mechanistic view of an etiological pathway. A potent risk factor for adult anxiety (amongst other psychopathology) is childhood emotional maltreatment (CEM), a prevalent and damaging form of early life stress broadly defined as the intentional or unintentional commission of acts (e.g. verbal abuse, taunting, belittling) or withholding of emotional resources (e.g. emotional neglect, unavailability, or dismissiveness) by caregivers that adversely influence the emotional health, growth, or adaptation of the child (Egeland, 2009). CEM is not only reliably associated with more severe anxiety in adulthood (Zlotnick et al. 2008; Simon et al. 2009; Spinhoven et al. 2010; Kuo et al. 2011) but both anxious and maltreated populations display altered processing of emotional stimuli, particularly those that are negative in valence and convey potential threat, i.e. fear and anger (Masten et al. 2008; Amir et al. 2009; Gibb et al. 2009; Klumpp & Amir, 2009; Waters et al. 2014). From a developmental perspective, the ability to accurately identify facial emotions is a crucial skill that facilitates a child's ability to read non-verbal cues, anticipate another's mental state, and adaptively respond to human interaction. In a childhood environment saturated with constant threats to emotional well-being via criticism, teasing, or verbal abuse, an increased sensitivity to facial emotions signaling a potential threat to emotional well-being is likely to convey an adaptive advantage, facilitating early detection and avoidance of a potentially emotionally harmful interaction with the caregiver (Masten et al. 2008; Gibb et al. 2009).

Over the course of development, however, this initially adaptive sensitivity may become maladaptive, rendering the individual prone to hypervigilance for potential threats to emotional stability in the environment and fostering heightened stress responses and poorer overall mental health (Herringa et al. 2013). The neurocircuitry underlying facial emotion processing encompasses both limbic and prefrontal regions responsive to emotion, such as the amygdala, insula, anterior cingulate/medial prefrontal cortex (ACC/mPFC), dorsolateral (dIPFC) and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex

(vlPFC), as well as specialized visual cortical faceprocessing regions such as the fusiform gyrus (Sabatinelli et al. 2011). Imaging studies have revealed that adult participants with anxiety disorders as well as those exposed to CEM display similar alterations distributed across this affective corticolimbic network in response to stimuli conveying threat or negative emotionality (Etkin & Wager, 2007; Williams et al. 2009; Dannlowski et al. 2012). Particularly relevant evidence comes from a series of studies investigating the neural 'imprinting' of CEM in the context of healthy individuals and outpatients with anxiety and depressive disorders. These studies reveal CEM is associated with reduced structural integrity and engagement of the mPFC to emotional and neutral word pair encoding and recognition (van Harmelen et al. 2010, 2014), as well as enhanced amygdala engagement to emotional and neutral faces (van Harmelen et al. 2013). Importantly, these findings did not vary as a function of psychopathology, suggesting such effects may be instantiated early in life and confer vulnerability to development of anxiety and depression. This aggregate evidence suggests CEM-related alterations in neural structure and neural responses to facial emotions may serve as one mechanism through which CEM promotes the propensity towards the manifestation of anxiety symptoms. However, the nature of this mechanism and relationships among its constituent neural components remains unknown. Ideally, one would prospectively follow individuals whom have experienced CEM and examine them longitudinally. Indeed, such an approach has already yielded promising results in adolescents (Burghy et al. 2012; Herringa et al. 2013). However, for examining such mechanisms into adulthood, this approach is time and cost prohibitive. Before such investments are made, it is prudent to first identify if neural characteristics in a cross-sectional sample of adults encompassing various levels of anxiety and retrospectively reported CEM can be leveraged towards informing future longitudinal investigations.

Here, we employ a transdiagnostic, mechanistically focused analytic approach across neural data from a large, primarily female sample of adults, both healthy and anxiety and mood-disordered. Consistent with a neurodevelopmental perspective on the RDoC initiative (Insel et al. 2010; Simpson, 2012; Casey et al. 2014; Insel, 2014), we utilize a dimensional approach to assessing a candidate neural mechanism that links a potent developmental risk factor to mental health outcomes. To do this, we employed a voxelwise mediation analysis mapping approach. To our knowledge, it is the first such application of this statistical technique to facilitate inference on neural mechanisms linking CEM to anxiety in adulthood. Mediation analysis provides a powerful statistical framework to test a

proposed mechanism linking two related variables (MacKinnon et al. 2007). In the current investigation, CEM served as the independent (causal) variable, adult anxiety symptoms as the outcome, and neural function and structure as the mechanism (indirect path) through which CEM conveys risk for anxiety symptoms in adulthood. We sought to answer the following questions: (a) Can a plausible neural mechanism relating CEM to anxiety be identified retrospectively from brain function and structure assessed in adulthood?; and (b) What is the nature of this neural mechanism?, i.e. which component brain structures are involved and what can we infer about the process(es) occurring in the brain from existing knowledge of neurocircuitry? Neural function was probed using separate emotion contrasts (fear, anger, and happy, each v. a sensorimotor baseline condition) from a widely employed facial emotion-processing paradigm. This task reliably activates conceptually relevant limbic and cortical regions (Bertolino et al. 2005; Hariri et al. 2005) and elicits neural abnormalities in anxious populations (Stein et al. 2007; Fonzo et al. 2010, 2013, 2015).

On the basis of existing findings (van Harmelen et al. 2010, 2013, 2014; Dannlowski et al. 2012), we expected to detect evidence consistent with the following hypothesized mechanism. We believe CEM provokes increased reactivity of affective processing regions to facial emotions, particularly those conveying negative valence and/or potential threat (e.g. fear and anger), which in turn initially promote a compensatory engagement of prefrontal substrates for affective regulation. Some individuals will be successful in regulating emotional state via cortical engagement, but in vulnerable individuals this compensatory mechanism likely breaks down with repeated overuse and leads to prefrontal hypoactivity and insufficient emotional regulation. In CEM-exposed adults with significant levels of anxiety symptoms, this compensatory engagement was likely ineffective at adequately regulating emotional state, leading to a dysregulation of emotional reactivity, hypofrontality, increased limbic engagement, and the emergence of symptoms. We also predict this threat-priming mechanism will interact with developmental brain processes to confer abnormal structure of implicated substrates, most notably in the PFC and hippocampus due to their prominent stress hormone structural sensitivity (Carrion et al. 2007; Kremen et al. 2010). Specifically, we hypothesized that increasing activation in limbic structures (i.e. amygdala and insula) across all emotion types would serve as an indirect path linking CEM to anxiety symptoms. In the context of negative valence facial emotions conveying potential threat, i.e. fear and anger, we also predicted decreasing activation in medial and lateral prefrontal

cortical regulatory regions would serve as an indirect path. Finally, due to considerable evidence demonstrating decreased prefrontal cortical and hippocampal gray matter volumes in individuals exposed to childhood maltreatment (Woon & Hedges, 2008; van Harmelen et al. 2010; Dannlowski et al. 2012; Fonzo et al. 2013; Kelly et al. 2013) and those with anxiety (Bonne et al. 2008; Uchida et al. 2008; Asami et al. 2009; Sobanski et al. 2010; Thomaes et al. 2010; Hettema et al. 2012), we also predicted decreasing prefrontal and hippocampal gray matter volumes would serve as an indirect path linking CEM to anxiety symptoms.

# Method

# Participants

One hundred eighty-two participants (148 females, 34 males) were recruited through online and print advertisements and referral from university-affiliated primary-care and mental health clinics. Participants were pooled from ongoing research studies investigating the neurobiology of anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and anxiety disorder-proneness (high levels of trait anxiety). These participants encompassed a wide range of anxiety psychopathology, consisting of psychiatrically healthy individuals as well as those with clinical and subclinical anxiety manifestations. Clinical participants were recruited on the basis of a primary diagnosis of PTSD, social anxiety disorder (SAD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), or panic disorder (PD). All diagnoses were confirmed through structured clinical interview by experienced clinicians using: (a) the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS; Blake et al. 1995) for those patients recruited into a PTSD study and their matched healthy controls; (b) Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnosis-DSM IV (SCID-IV; First et al. 1998) for individuals recruited for a primary diagnosis GAD, PD, or for high levels of trait anxiety, and their matched healthy controls; and (c) Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (Sheehan et al. 1998) for individuals recruited into an SAD study. Exclusion criteria included lifetime diagnosis of psychotic disorder, organic mental disorder, mental retardation, bipolar disorder, substance dependence in the past year, and substance abuse in the past month. All participants were medication-free for a minimum of 30 days prior to study enrollment and not undergoing current psychotherapy for anxiety or related symptoms. After complete description of the study to subjects, they provided informed written consent according to University of California San Diego Institutional Review Board guidelines (see Table 1 for more information).

#### Self-report measures

The emotional abuse (EA) and emotional neglect (EN) subscales from the 28-item Short Form version of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ-SF, Bernstein et al. 2003) were additively combined to create a composite measure of CEM. Scores on CTQ subscales range from 5 to 25 and assess EA, EN, physical abuse (PA), physical neglect (PN), and sexual abuse (SA). Given their high intercorrelation (r = 0.76) in this sample, EA and EN scores were combined to yield a single measure of CEM; thus, the CEM composite measure ranged from 10 to 50. Anxiety symptoms were quantified using the score from the 6-item anxiety subscale (BSI-Anx) of the Brief Symptom Inventory-18 (Derogatis & Fitzpatrick, 2004) in which participants rate, on a 5-point Likert scale, how often they were distressed by a list of symptoms within the past week. Symptoms of depression were quantified using the depression subscale of this same measure (BSI-Dep).

#### Emotion-processing task

Participants completed a modified version of the Emotion Face Assessment Task (Hariri et al. 2005; Paulus et al. 2005) with angry, happy, or fearful faces. On each trial, participants viewed a trio of faces and were instructed to match the facial expression of the top face to one of the two bottom faces through key press of a button box (see Supplementary method for further details).

# Image acquisition

Data were collected during task completion using fMRI image parameters sensitive to BOLD contrast on a 3 T GE Signa EXCITE (GE Healthcare, USA) scanner [T2\*-weighted echo planar imaging, repetition time (TR)=2000 ms, echo time (TE)=32 ms, field of view (FOV) = 250 × 250 mm, 64 × 64 matrix, 30 2.6 mm axial slices with 1.4 mm gap, 256 repetitions]. A highresolution T1-weighted image [172 sagitally acquired spoiled gradient recalled 1 mm thick slices, inversion time (TI)=450 ms, TR=8 ms, TE=4 ms, flip angle= 12°, FOV = 250 × 250 mm] was also collected from each participant for anatomical reference. Echo-planar images were preprocessed by interpolating voxel timeseries data to correct for non-simultaneous slice acquisition in each volume.

# Activation preprocessing and individual analysis

Data were processed using the AFNI software package (Cox, 1996). The outcome measures of interest were activation magnitudes for the within-subject contrasts of trials in which the subject engaged in emotion matching directed towards angry, fearful, or happy

faces v. the shape-matching baseline condition (see Supplementary method for details).

#### Optimized voxel-based morphometry

Gray-matter (GM) volumes were assessed using FSL-VBM, a voxel-based morphometry style analysis (Ashburner & Friston, 2000; Good et al. 2001) implemented using FSL tools (Smith et al. 2004) (see Supplementary method for details).

# Task effect activation

In order to identify significant task-evoked activation within each contrast, t tests against the null hypothesis were carried out on individual activation maps across all participants.

#### Basic mediation analyses

Voxelwise basic mediation analyses were conducted using the MBESS package (Kelley, 2007a,b; Kelley & Lai, 2012) implemented in R (R Core Team, 2013). Mediation models provide a statistical framework for testing a proposed variable as an indirect path (brain function/structure) for conveying an effect of an independent variable (CEM) on a dependent variable (adult anxiety symptoms) (MacKinnon et al. 2007). CEM served as the independent variable and anxiety symptoms served as the dependent variable in the mediation model. For each activation contrast and GM volumetric map, voxelwise percent signal change (% SC) or GM volumes served as the respective mediating variable in the mediation model. The main outcome measure was the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the indirect effect (mediation effect). Bootstrapping of the indirect effect was utilized to determine the standard error (S.E.) and CIs of the indirect effect (MacKinnon et al. 2007). At each voxel, 500 bootstrap samples were utilized to derive S.E. estimates.

#### Region of interest (ROI) and whole-brain analyses

Two types of analyses were conducted on the group level. For functional data, in addition to a whole-brain exploratory analysis, a-priori ROI analyses were conducted on emotion-processing brain regions previously implicated in studies of anxiety and CEM: bilateral insula, bilateral amygdala, and ACC/mPFC. Boundaries of these ROIs were based upon both anatomical criteria and standardized locations taken from the Talairach atlas (Talairach & Tournoux, 1998). For structural data, these regions were also investigated in ROI analyses, with the addition of the bilateral hippocampus.

# Extended mediation analyses

We performed moderated mediation analyses to test if the strength of mediation relationships were conditional on another variable – that is, if identifiable subject characteristics could influence the strength of mechanistic effects. In particular, we were interested whether structural brain characteristics influenced the mediation relationship of specific functional brain activation patterns between CEM and anxiety. Moderated mediation tests whether the strength of a mediating variable's effect on the relationship between the independent and dependent variables is conditional upon a fourth variable. In this context, we conducted exploratory analyses to test whether the strength of the effect of a particular cluster of brain activation on mediating the

CEM-anxiety symptom relationship was moderated by brain structure (GM volumes). We also performed additional mediation analysis on brain activation identified in the voxelwise mediation analysis to test if the mediating effect of brain function on the CEM-anxiety symptom relationship remained significant when controlling for current regional GM volumes. In order to perform moderated mediation analyses and mediation with covariates, the average %SCs and GM volumes were extracted from each participant from clusters displaying significant basic mediation effects in the voxelwise analyses. The PROCESS package (Hayes, 2013) implemented in IBM SPSS version 19.0 (IBM SPSS Inc., 2010) was utilized for extended mediation analyses. Bootstrapping of the CI of the indirect effect was utilized to determine significance. To describe the robustness of mediation effects and their adequacy in supporting our proposed threat-priming model, we also tested the indirect effect of an alternative model (anxiety symptoms mediating the effect of CEM on brain function/ structure). To examine the degree to which the indirect effect accounted for the relationship between the independent and dependent variables in each model, we constrained the direct path between the variables to zero to test the adequacy of a fully mediated relationship, i.e. if the effects of the independent variable on the dependent variable are conveyed entirely via the mediator. We report the x2 for each model with the direct path constrained to zero, as well as root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), the Comparative Fit Index (CFI), and the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR). These model fit indices were derived using MPlus version 7.3.1 (Muthén & Muthén, 1998-2012). Good model fit indices with the direct path constrained to zero (e.g. non-significant x, RSMEA and SRMR < 0.1, CFI> 0.93) in combination with a significant indirect effect suggest a fully mediated relationship between the independent and dependent variable, while poor model fit statistics with a significant indirect effect indicate a partially mediated relationship.

# Results

# Demographics and symptoms

The sample was almost entirely female (~81%) and displayed low levels of CEM and anxiety symptoms, on average, though the full spectrum observed ranged from low to severe (Table 1).

#### Relationships among CEM and anxiety symptoms

As expected, CEM was significantly positively correlated with BSI-Anx scores (Pearson's r=0.317, p< 0.001) and BSI-Dep scores (Pearson's r = 0.347, p < 0.001). The BSI-Anx and BSI-Dep subscales were also significant positively correlated (Pearson's r=0.694, p < 0.001). The associations between CEM and anxiety and depression symptoms continued to remain significant after controlling for age, gender, years of education, and presence of a current anxiety or depressive disorder.

# Task-related behavior

All participants completed the emotional facematching task with high levels of accuracy. There were no significant correlations between measures of accuracy and reaction time and measures of CEM, anxiety symptoms, or depressive symptoms (all p's>0.05) (see Table 1).

# Task-related activation

In brief, all emotion contrasts activated the bilateral amygdala, bilateral posterior insula, subgenual ACC, and visual cortices, and deactivated the perigenual ACC. For fear and anger, additional activation was observed in the bilateral dIPFC and bilateral anterior insula (see Supplementary Tables S1-S3).

# Threat-related limbic activation and maltreatment-priming effects

To test our hypothesis that CEM will prime affective processing regions for exaggerated reactivity to threatening facial cues, we examined two threat-contrasts of interest: anger v. shapes and fear v. shapes. For the contrast of fear v. shapes, greater activation in the right posterior insula [indirect effect=0.009, 95% bootstrapped CI 0.001-0.016; x2(1)=17.36, p<0.0001; RMSEA = 0.30, 90% CI 0.187-0.431; CFI = 0.27; SRMR = 0.101] and the right amygdala [indirect effect = 0.028, 95% bootstrapped CI 0.001-0.057; x-(1) = 15.27, p = 0.0001; RMSEA=0.280, 90% CI 0.168-0.412; CFI= 0.552; SRMR = 0.09] partially mediated the relationship between CEM and anxiety (Table 2, Fig. 1). Note that model fit indices when constraining the direct effect to zero were poor in both regions, indicating that although the indirect effect is significant it does not fully account for the relationship between CEM and anxiety, i.e. partial mediation. The alternative model indirect effect was non-significant for both the

For the contrast of anger v. shapes, greater activation in the left amygdala partially mediated the relationship between CEM and anxiety [indirect effect = 0.019, 95% bootstrapped CI 0.005-0.033; x2(1)=15.015, p=0.0001; RMSEA=0.277, 90% CI 0.165-0.409; CFI=0.539; SRMR=0.089; Table 2, Fig. 1]. Although the indirect effect was significant, the overall model fit was poor, indicating a partial mediation effect. The indirect effect of the alternative mediation model was also not significant [indirect effect = 0.006, 95% bootstrapped CI -0.001 to 0.013; x(1)= 25.87, p<0.0001; RMSEA=0.301, 90% CI 0.194-0.408; CFI=0.215; SRMR=0.132] and model fit statistics were also poor. Indirect effects remained significant when controlling for structural characteristics (i.e. GM volume).

# Threat-related prefrontal activation and maltreatment-related engagement

We next examined prefrontal substrates using an ROI mask for the ACC/mPFC and a whole-brain mask for the remaining portions to test the hypothesis that CEM-related priming of affective processing regions would tax prefrontal affective control regions and result in diminished prefrontal cortical responses. For the contrast of fear v. shapes, we observed that less activation in the right dIPFC (middle/superior frontal gyri; BA 8 and 9) partially mediated the relationship between CEM and anxiety symptoms [indirect effect=0.014, 95% bootstrapped CI 0.001-0.029; x2(1)=16.53, p<0.0001; RMSEA = 0.292, 90% CI 0.179-0.423; CFI=0.498; SRMR = 0.095; Table 2, Fig. 2]. Again, the indirect effect was significant but model fit statistics were generally

poor, indicating the mediation effect was partial. The mediation effect was non-significant for the alternative model [indirect effect = =0.003, 95% bootstrapped CI -0.007 to 0.001; x2(1)=24.78, p<0.0001; RMSEA= 0.350, 90% CI 0.268-0.443; CFI=0.116; SRMR=0.127] and model fit statistics were also poor. We also observed effects in other non-hypothesized regions (see Supplementary Results). For the contrast of anger v. shapes, we observed that decreasing activation in the right dIPFC (inferior/middle frontal gyri; BA 10 and 46) also partially mediated the relationship between CEM and anxiety [indirect effect=0.018, 95% bootstrapped CI 0.001-0.035; x (1) = 15.644, p = 0.0001; RMSEA = 0.284, 90% CI 0.171-0.415; CFI = 0.479; SRMR = 0.092; Table 2, Fig. 2]. Model fit statistics were poor, indicating the mediation effect was partial. The mediation effect was non-significant for the alternative model [indirect effect = - 0.002, 95% bootstrapped CI - 0.005 to 0.001; x(1)=25.23, p<0.0001; RMSEA=0.324, 90% CI 0.194-0.454; CFI=0.213; SRMR=0.138] and model fit

statistics were also poor. We additionally observed mediation effects in medial prefrontal regions for anger, with greater activation in the ventral ACC [indirect effect = 0.020, 95% bootstrapped CI 0.001-0.039; x (1) = 15.962, p = 0.0001; RMSEA = 0.287, 90% CI 0.174-0.415; CFI=0.451; SRMR=0.093] and decreasing activation in the dorsal ACC partially mediating this relationship [indirect effect = 0.028, 95% bootstrapped CI 0.004-0.053; x (1) = 13.835, p = 0.0002; RMSEA = 0.266, 90% CI 0.154-0.398; CFI = 0.634; SRMR = 0.084; Table 2, Fig. 2]. Indirect effects were significant but model fit statistics were also poor for both ACC effects, indicating the mediation effects were partial. The mediation effect was non-significant for the alternative model in both the ventral ACC [indirect effect = 0.006, 95% bootstrapped CI -0.001 to 0.013; x2(1)=23.41, p<0.0001; RMSEA = 0.318, 90% CI 0.215-0.421; CFI=0.263; SRMR = 0.142] and dorsal ACC [indirect effect = - 0.002, 95% bootstrapped CI -0.005 to 0.001; x(1) = 21.398, p < 0.0001; RMSEA = 0.342, 90% CI 0.274-0.410; CFI = 0.389;
SRMR=0.112] and model fit statistics for both were also poor. Indirect effects remained significant when controlling for structural characteristics.

## Ventral striatal engagement to happy faces and maltreatment effects

We then examined brain responses to happy faces v. shapes to examine if limbic activation mediated the relationship between CEM and anxiety symptoms. We did not observe any significant mediation effects in a-priori hypothesized regions. An exploratory whole brain analysis did, however, identify additional effects of interest. Decreasing activation in a cluster encompassing the ventral striatum/pallidum (lentiform nucleus and caudate head) and hypothalamus partially mediated the relationship between CEM and anxiety [indirect effect =0.015, 95% bootstrapped CI 0.001-0.029; x2(1)=17.115, p<0.0001; RMSEA=0.298, 90% CI 0.185-0.429; CFI=0.385; SRMR=0.090; Table 2, Supplementary Fig. S1]. This was also a partial mediation effect, as indicated by the significant indirect effect but poor model fit statistics when constraining the direct path from CEM to anxiety. The indirect effect for the alternative model was non-significant [indirect effect = = 0.001, 95% bootstrapped CI -0.003 to 0.001; x (1) = 20.732, 0.214-0.454; CFI=0.302; SRMR=0.142] and model fit was also poor. An additional similar effect was observed in the right visual cortex [lingual gyrus; indirect effect =0.011, 95% bootstrapped CI 0.002-0.020; x (1) = 16.737, p < 0.0001; RMSEA = 0.294, 90% CI 0.181-0.425; CFI=0.329; SRMR=0.091]. The indirect effect for the alternative model was non-significant [indirect effect = - 0.002, 95% bootstrapped CI -- 0.005 to 0.001; x2(1)=19.484, p<0.0001; RMSEA=0.387, 90% CI 0.294-0.480; CFI=0.284; SRMR = 0.122] and model fit was also poor. Indirect effects remained significant when controlling for structural characteristics. Given the role of the ventral striatum in reward and positive affect, we expected the mediation effect seen in this region for the CEM-anxiety relationship might be better accounted for by concurrent symptoms of diminished positive affect (e.g. anhedonia) observed in depression. We therefore also tested extracted %SCs as a mediator of the relationship between CEM and BSI-Dep scores. However, activation in this region to happy facial expressions did not significantly mediate the CEMdepression relationship (lower bound of 95% CI for indirect effect = - 0.003).

## Maltreatment effects on prefrontal brain structure

We also predicted our hypothesized functional mechanism would interact with brain development to result in abnormal structure of affective processing and control substrates in adulthood. In support of this, we examined GM volumes in limbic regions first, including the amygdala, hippocampus, and insula. There were no limbic structures in which GM volumes mediated the relationship between CEM and anxiety.

Next, we used an ROI analysis for the ACC/mPFC and a whole-brain analysis for the lateral PFC to examine how prefrontal structure might be implicated in our proposed model. We observed that smaller GM volumes in the right dlPFC (inferior/middle frontal gyri; BA 10 and 46) partially mediated the relationship between CEM and anxiety [indirect effect = 0.020, 95% bootstrapped 95% CI 0.001-0.039; x (1) = 13.551, p = 0.0002; RMSEA=0.263, 90% CI 0.151-0.395; CFI= 0.556; SRMR = 0.085; Table 3, Fig. 3]. The indirect effect was significant though model fit was poor when constraining the direct effect, indicating a partial mediation. The indirect effect for the alternative model was non-significant [indirect effect=0.001, 95% bootstrapped CI -0.009 to 0.011; x (1) = 19.101, p < 0.0001; RMSEA=0.365, 90% CI 0.283-0.447; CFI= 0.313; SRMR=0.115] and model fit was also poor. Moreover, this structural effect partially overlapped the functional effect seen in this same affective control region for processing anger expressions. To determine if this effect may be attributed entirely to the functional process implicated in this region, this structural mediation effect was also tested for significance when controlling for brain activation to anger v. shapes in this cluster. This effect continued to remain significant when controlling for functional activation (see Table 3 for details). We also observed additional structural effects in non-hypothesized regions (see Supplementary Results).

# Structural independence of functional mediation effects

In order to explore whether the strength of a functional mediation effects was conditional upon the structure of that particular region, structural characteristics of regions (i.e. GM volumes of clusters) displaying functional mediation effects were explored as potential moderators of the mediation effect in limbic and prefrontal regions relevant to our hypotheses (bilateral amygdala, right posterior insula, dorsal and ventral ACC, and right dlPFC). We did not observe any significant moderation effects of structural characteristics on strength of functional mediation.

## Discussion

Fig. 3. Decreasing right dorsolateral pray matter volumes partially mediates the childhood emotional maltreatment (CEM)-anxiety relationship. Graphs depict the relationship between regional gray-matter volume and anxiety symptoms at different levels of CEM (the additive combination of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire Short Form emotional abuse and emotional neglect subscales), with the center fitted line indicating the gray-matter volume-anxiety relationship at the CEM sample mean and each line above or below representing one standard deviation above or below the CEM mean, respectively, AU, Arbitrary units; BSI, Brief Symptom Inventory.

with a wide range of CEM and transdiagnostic anxiety symptoms to identify candidate neural mechanisms that may underlie the CEM conferment of risk for anxiety disorders. We tested a hypothesized corticolimbic threat priming model as a potential neural mechanism linking these two constructs. This study produced three primary findings consistent with this model. First, greater amygdala engagement to both fear and anger partially mediated the relationship between CEM and anxiety symptoms. Second, decreasing recruitment of the right dIPFC to fear and anger also partially mediated the relationship between CEM and

anxiety symptoms. Third, diminished structural integrity (lower GM volumes) of the right dIPFC partially mediated the relationship between CEM and adulthood anxiety. Taken together, these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that CEM predisposes individuals to the development of anxiety via a breakdown of cortical regulation of limbic responses to emotional stimuli that convey negative valence and/or potential threat. Moreover, these findings demonstrate the utility of adult brain measures in facilitating inference on etiological neural mechanisms that relate known risk factors to mental health outcomes. Such

inferences, although post-hoc and retrospective, will likely be important contributors to the design of future longitudinal studies that can confirm or disconfirm hypothesized models.

The overall mediating neural activation pattern is consistent with an emotional dysregulation mechanism of CEM effects, such that exposure to stressful childhood emotional experiences like verbal abuse and emotional neglect disrupt normal socioemotional functioning by fostering enhanced emotional reactivity to threatening interpersonal stimuli (i.e. threat-priming), and over time this results in a dysregulation of stress and fear responses and the emergence of anxiety symptoms (Nolte et al. 2011). These findings dovetail nicely with recent longitudinal reports implicating frontal-amygdalar resting connectivity as another developmental mechanism linking early life stress to anxiety and internalizing symptoms later in life (Burghy et al. 2012; Herringa et al. 2013). Here, we observed the amygdala and right dIPFC to be two key nodes of one potential mechanism linking CEM with anxiety, both implicated in response to processing of negative valence facial emotions that convey potential threat (fear and anger), but not emotions lacking a threatening context (i.e. happy). These findings are broadly in accord with existing emotional regulatory theories that posit an important role for the dIPFC in regulating emotional reactivity in the amygdala (Delgado et al. 2008; Ray & Zald, 2012), particularly during use of topdown emotional regulatory strategies such as cognitive reappraisal (Ochsner & Gross, 2005). These interactions likely occur primarily via indirect connections between the dIPFC and amygdala by way of the ACC or orbitofrontal cortex, though the dIPFC and amygdala do share sparse direct connections but more plentiful indirect connections via thalamic pathways (Ray & Zald, 2012; Eden et al. 2015). In the context of emotional reactivity, the dIPFC co-activates with the amygdala in attending to stimuli of negative emotional valence as well as under conditions necessitating top-down attentional control (Comte et al. 2014). Moreover, prior findings in both adolescents and adults suggest early life stress impacts dIPFC and amygdala structure and function in the context of both emotional reactivity and regulation (Dannlowski et al. 2012, 2013; Marusak et al. 2015). These previously reported findings suggest: (a) dIPFC-amygdala interactions are important in regulating and attending to negative affect; (b) the dIPFC exerts a regulatory role over amygdala activity, most prominently under conditions that bring cognitive resources to bear; and (c) this relationship is disrupted from exposure to extreme stress early in life. Notably, increased dIPFC engagement to emotional conflict regulation was observed in adolescents exposed to childhood trauma (Marusak et al. 2015), consistent

with the proposal that CEM will initially provoke increased compensatory prefrontal engagement for regulation of emotional state, which across development will lead to a breakdown of dIPFC regulatory processes in a subset of individuals that go on to manifest psychopathology. The current findings support the aforementioned hypotheses, demonstrating that greater amygdala and reduced dIPFC engagement to fear and anger cues in adulthood partially account for the positive relationship between CEM and anxiety symptoms across a large sample with a wide range of anxiety and mood psychopathology. These findings are also broadly consistent with highly-relevant prior work, which found indiscriminate amygdalar hyperactivation to emotional and neutral facial expressions as a function of CEM, with effect sizes being the largest for fear and anger (van Harmelen et al. 2013).

Further implicating the right dIPFC in CEM conferment of risk for anxiety, GM volumes in this region were also found to partially mediate the relationship between CEM and anxiety. Both anxiety and childhood maltreatment have been found to be associated with reduced GM volumes in the lateral prefrontal cortices (Yoo et al. 2005; Woodward et al. 2009; Eckart et al. 2010; Gatt et al. 2010). This convergence of functional and structural effects across studies in the same brain region leads us to speculate that the right dIPFC is a structure vulnerable to becoming 'scarred' by early maltreatment experiences, and this may promote dysregulatory effects on emotional processing that lead to anxiety. The lateral portions of the PFC, in particular, are some of the latest regions to fully mature over the course of brain development (Shaw et al. 2008), which suggests the relative immaturity of this region in childhood may render this structure particularly prone to a reduced functional capacity from chronic fear and stress states. Given the cross-sectional design of this study, it is impossible to determine casual relationships between dIPFC functional and structural effects. We also expected hippocampal GM volume to mediate the CEM-anxiety relationship, but we did not observe any significant effects. Meta-analyses have indicated variable effects of stress and trauma on hippocampal volume stratified by developmental stage (Karl et al. 2006; Woon & Hedges, 2008), and such effects may be most prominent in neuropsychiatric disorders manifesting a dysregulation of the hypothalamtic-pituitary-adrenal axis (Sapolsky, 2000). Thus, reductions in hippocampal volume may not be an enduring neural characteristic influencing the CEM-anxiety relationship, or this influence may occur via other types of maltreatment or be present more prominently within a specific subset of individuals.

We also observed a notable emotion specificity of mediation effects in the dorsal ACC and ventral ACC

during anger processing. The finding of greater ventral ACC activation and decreasing dorsal ACC activation to anger cues partially mediating the CEM-anxiety relationship is broadly consistent with the pattern of dIPFC-amygdala findings across both anger and fear, indicating a mismatch between: (a) increasing activity of a ventral, 'automatic' emotion-processing stream (composed primarily of the amgydala and ventral ACC/mPFC) that is emotionally reactive and drives implicit regulatory activity; and (b) decreasing activity of a dorsal, 'deliberate' processing stream (composed primarily of dorsal ACC/mPFC and dIPFC) implicated in explicit, effortful top-down control of emotion and cognitive functions (Ochsner & Gross, 2005; Phillips et al. 2008; Etkin & Schatzberg, 2011). This finding is also consistent with a prior study that observed greater ventral ACC engagement to angry faces was associated with greater levels of childhood maltreatment in posttraumatic stress disorder (Fonzo et al. 2013). Though anger and fear are both negative valence emotions that signal potential threat, evidence indicates there are subtle behavioral and neural differences in the processing of these two facial expressions. A large meta-analysis of emotional face processing reported significant ACC activation for anger but not fear (Fusar-Poli et al. 2009), consistent with the angerspecific ACC effects observed here. Moreover, an angry face directed at oneself conveys a localizable, self-relevant, and imminent threat from the expresser, consistent with the role of the ACC/mPFC in selfrelevance processing (Amodio & Frith, 2006), but a fear face conveys information regarding a potential threat elsewhere in the environment. Some evidence indicates these expressions, though both indicating threat, also induce subtle differences in approach/ avoidance behaviors in the receiver (Marsh et al. 2005). From this perspective, we speculate CEM may interact with innate neural patterns of type-specific emotion processing to form dissociable mechanistic pathways contributing to the manifestation of anxiety symptoms later in life. It is notable that ventral ACC engagement in emotional contexts (particularly those presenting fear cues or generating fear states) may serve an adaptive response under certain conditions (Etkin et al. 2010) or in clinical manifestations of posttraumatic stress (Liberzon & Garfinkel, 2009; Milad et al. 2009). However, the current results and prior findings for ventral ACC hyperactivity in other anxiety manifestations (Amir et al. 2005; Pillay et al. 2007; Goldin et al. 2009; Labuschagne et al. 2012) and individuals exposed to childhood maltreatment (Williams et al. 2009) suggest that greater ventral ACC engagement to emotional cues may signal very conceptually different processes depending on the emotional context, behavior, or clinical population.

Finally, we would like to briefly comment on the effects observed in response to happy faces. We did not observe any hypothesized mediation effects in the amygdala, which seems inconsistent with a prior study that observed increased amygdala activation to happy (and neutral) faces in individuals exposed to CEM (van Harmelen et al. 2013). However, another study in a non-clinical sample also failed to observe significant relationships between history of childhood maltreatment and amygdala reactivity to subliminal presentation of happy faces (Dannlowski et al. 2013). Differences in task design and sample composition may account for these conflicting findings, or CEM effects on amygdala response to facial expressions of happiness may be weaker and only variably reach statistical significance. As we used mediation models to detect mechanistic pathways that account for the relationship between CEM and anxiety, another possibility is that CEM effects on amygdala responses to happy faces may not serve to provoke anxiety in afflicted individuals. Indeed, the pattern of findings observed here, specifically decreasing ventral striatal/pallidal activation to happy faces partially mediating the CEM-anxiety relationship, suggests that CEM-related blunting of emotional responses in reward-sensitive basal ganglia structures (Smith et al. 2009) may render vulnerability to anxiety. Given that the ventral striatum and ventral pallidum are heavily implicated in approach behavior, positive affect, reward, and motivation (O'Doherty, 2004; Smith et al. 2009), this effect could reflect a CEM-rendered vulnerability to blunted representation of positive affect. We were unable to disentangle anxiety and depression-specific effects here, given the extensive overlap in BSI subscale variance observed in this sample. However, consistent with prior work linking reward circuitry abnormalities to early life stress (Dillon et al. 2009; Mehta et al. 2010) and major depression (Pizzagalli et al. 2009; Pizzagalli, 2014), these findings hint at an alternative mechanistic pathway linking CEM to future psychopathology via blunted emotional responsivity to positive-valence (or rewarding) emotional stimuli.

There are several limitations to the current study. Importantly, the design of this study was crosssectional and retrospective and the results were correlational in nature. As such, we were unable to acquire measurements of CEM, neural characteristics, and anxiety in successive order to establish temporal precedence. Thus, we are unable to draw definitive conclusions on the causal effects of CEM on brain function/structure or how any such effects may influence susceptibility to development of anxiety. Although the analytic approach of the current study was informed by theory and prior evidence, longitudinal studies are necessary to establish that CEM exerts

effects on brain structure and function which promote susceptibility to the emergence of later anxiety symptoms. There are also other interpretations of the current findings aside from the proposed maltreatment threatpriming mechanism promoting manifestation of anxiety, including the possibility that these neural effects relate to other processes, influences, or vulnerabilities that co-occur with maltreatment and anxiety symptoms. Thus, the primary utility of the current findings lies in hypothesis-generation and informing design of future studies. Second, the sample utilized was composed of healthy participants as well as those with a variety of clinical and non-clinical anxiety manifestations. Given power constraints, we are unable to determine whether mediation effects are specific to a particular syndromal manifestation or whether diagnostic status impacted the strength of mediation effects. However, the current analysis is most consistent with the dimensional approach to psychopathology laid out in the NIMH RDoC (Insel et al. 2010; Insel, 2014) in its focus on developmental factors that may contribute to alteration in the domain of negative (and positive) valence brain systems. Third, many of the clinical anxiety participants met criteria for comorbid depressive disorders, and this may reduce specificity of the results to the relationship between CEM and anxiety. However, inclusion of these subjects is also consistent with the high comorbidity among anxiety/depressive disorders in the population (Kessler et al. 2005) as well as the substantial overlap of neurocircuitry abnormalities in both types of disorders (Etkin & Wager, 2007; Hamilton et al. 2012). Fourth, the majority of the sample was composed of adult Caucasian females with low levels of CEM and anxiety symptoms, though these measures did range from none to severe. Thus, these results may not generalize well to male populations or other ethnic groups, and the negative skew towards low levels of symptoms and maltreatment experiences may not have provided optimal power to detect effects. Fifth, the emotionprocessing task used here presents two faces with matching emotional expressions in the presence of a third, non-congruent emotional expression on each trial. Thus, the results of this study are not directly comparable to those presenting single faces or nonfacial threat stimuli. Sixth, mediation model fit measures were generally poor when constraining the direct effect to zero for both the proposed mediation model (the brain mediating the CEM-anxiety relationship) and the alternative mediation model (anxiety mediating the relationship between CEM and the brain). However, the indirect effects for the proposed model were significant while those for the alternative model were not, indicating a partial (but not full) mediation effect of the brain on the CEM-anxiety relationship.

Thus, the current findings must be considered preliminary in light of these factors, and future studies should attempt to incorporate additional variables to develop sophisticated multivariate models that can fully account for the relationship between CEM and anxiety (e.g. multiple indirect effects, moderated mediation, etc.). Finally, we did not collect information on current life stress or adult trauma across this sample of participants, which may have been useful in establishing the specificity of neural effects to childhood experiences.

In closing, this study provides strong preliminary evidence supporting a neurodevelopmental mechanism linking CEM to anxiety in adulthood. This evidence suggests CEM exaggerates bottom-up emotional reactivity and attenuates top-down regulatory control when encountering negative-valence and/or threat-conveying emotional cues, which is consistent with existing evidence for emotional dysregulation as a psychological characteristic in survivors of childhood maltreatment (Wright et al. 2009; Pechtel & Pizzagalli, 2010; Tottenham et al. 2010). It is notable the mediation effects observed here, though statistically significant, were subtle in magnitude and accounted for only 1-3% of the total variance in anxiety symptoms. This fact is encouraging on two fronts - first, subtle influences of developmental factors on in-vivo dynamics of the adult brain are detectable much later in life and can be used to postulate mechanisms related to later mental health outcomes; and second, there is still a great deal of individual variability in neural characteristics left to be explored that may reflect other parallel or intersecting developmental pathways to anxiety in adulthood. We hope the effects demonstrated here may provide further impetus for the consideration of developmental characteristics in systems neuroscience etiological models of anxiety and lead to the undertaking of more rigorous longitudinal studies. These studies will be crucial in supporting or refuting results from retrospective investigations, and will sharpen insights into other developmental considerations such as neurodevelopmental trajectories, sensitive periods, and transactional relationships between individual characteristics conferring risk and resilience (Casey et al. 2014). Such efforts will hopefully lead to the identification of several distinct developmental pathways to anxiety disorders with unique and shared neural mechanisms, potentially informing development or modification of interventions to target 'ecophenotypic' variants of psychopathology (Teicher & Samson, 2013).

# A B S T R A C T

Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the relative contributions of disorganization and cognitive dysfunction to quality of life (QOL) in patients with stable schizophrenia.

Methods: A total of 276 consecutive outpatients with stable schizophrenia were enrolled in a cross-sectional study. We performed a mediation analysis to assess the specific effect of disorganization on QOL, as assessed by the Heinrichs–Carpenter Quality of Life Scale (QLS), and the possible mediating role of cognitive dysfunction. Results: Our findings were as follows: (i) disorganization was negatively related to the total QLS score; (ii) disorganization was negatively related to two of the four QLS domains, namely the role-functioning domain (occupational/educational) and the intrapsychic functioning domain (e.g., motivation, curiosity, and (iii) verbal memory was a partial mediator of the relationship between disorganization and QLS (the total score and the two above-mentioned domains ).

Conclusions: Disorganization demonstrated direct effects via verbal memory on two domains of functioning, as measured by the QLS. These results highlight the importance of improving disorganization and cognition (particularly verbal memory) to improve the functional outcomes of patients with schizophrenia. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

1. Introduction

Regarding the factors that influence quality of life (QOL) in patients with schizophrenia, the majority of researchers have primarily focused on psychiatric symptoms, although many other influential predictors have been identified (Eack et al., 2007). Indeed, one factor that has been shown to be consistently negatively associated with QOL is psychopathology (Lambert and Naber, 2004). QOL has been negatively correlated with positive, negative, and general psychopathology, as well as with depressive symptoms; some studies have found a large relationship between these measures (Norman et al., 2000; Fitzgerald et al., 2001; Rocca et al., 2005), while other studies have identified only a small to moderate relationship (Sim et al., 2004; Ritsner et al., 2005). In many of these studies, positive symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions, were combined with conceptual disorganization to form a positive symptom factor. Over time, several factor-analytic studies (Norman et al., 1997; Meagher et al., 2000) have supported the view that delusions and hallucinations are distinct from positive symptoms, such as formal thought disorders. As a result, disorganization has emerged as a separate domain worthy of consideration. Disorganization was introduced by Liddle (1987) as an important third factor in addition to the positive and negative symptom factors. According to Liddle, schizophrenic symptoms segregated into three syndromes: psychomotor poverty (poverty of speech, lack of spontaneous movement and various aspects of blunting of affect); disorganization (inappropriate affect, poverty of content of speech, and disturbances of the form of thought); and reality distortion (particular types of delusions and hallucinations). Some studies have suggested that disorganization may be a stronger predictor of community function than reality distortion (Norman et al., 1999; Ventura et al., 2009).

Much more attention has been paid to cognitive dysfunction because it may lead to poor community functioning, including social functioning, work performance, and social skills (Bryson and Bell, 2003). Cognitive deficits persist throughout the illness and serve as rate-limiting factors associated with functional recovery (Keefe and Fenton, 2007). Studies investigating the ability of neurocognitive variables to predict QOL in individuals with schizophrenia have yielded conflicting results. However,

a recent meta-analysis revealed a markedly different relationship between neurocognition and objective and subjective QOL (Tolman and Kurtz, 2012). Small to moderate relationships (d ≤ 0.55) were found between crystallized verbal ability, working memory verbal list learning, processing speed, and the executive function and objective indices associated with QOL. In contrast, the results revealed either nonsignificant or inverse relationships for the vast majority of neurocognitive measures and measures of subjective QOL.

Concerning the relationships between cognition and symptoms, there is evidence in the literature of strong correlations between performance on neurocognitive tests and negative symptoms (Ventura et al., 2009). Differential relationships between positive symptoms and neurocognitive functioning have been reported. Symptoms of disorganization, when reported as a factor separate from reality distortion, appear to be related to neurocognition and warrant a separate empirical study. A recent meta-analysis demonstrated a small to moderate (r = -0.23) relationship between disorganization and neurocognition, while the relationship between neurocognition and reality distortion was relatively weak (r = −0.04). Disorganization was related to all of the domains of cognitive functioning examined, including verbal memory (r = - 0.20), attention/vigilance (r = - 0.25), reasoning and problem solving (r = - 0.24), processing speed (r = - 0.26), visual memory (r = - 0.20), and working memory (r = - 0.20). In contrast, reality distortion showed no such broad association (r values ranging from — 0.01 to -0.12) (Ventura et al., 2010).

 Previous research has linked disorganization to neurocognition and neurocognition to QOL, although in separate studies. The present study was conducted to determine whether the relationship between disorganization and QOL may be mediated by the extent of cognitive deficits in patients with schizophrenia.

 Thus, the objectives of the current study were three-fold. First, we investigated the ability of disorganization alone to predict QOL. Given the previous contradictory findings in the literature, we intended for this investigation to be an exploratory analysis and expected that the disorganization would predict a significantly lower QOL. Second, we studied the ability of cognition alone to predict QOL. Given the results of previous studies, we anticipated a role for cognition in the prediction of QOL. Third, we explored the possibility that disorganization continues to predict QOL when cognition is also considered. It was expected that both disorganization and neuropsychological deficits interact to influence QOL, with neuropsychological deficits acting as partial mediators of the relationship between disorganization and QOL.

# 2. Materials and methods

# 2.1. Participants

This study was conducted at the Department of Neuroscience, Psychiatric Section, and the Department of Mental Health ASL TO1 Molinette-Turin, Italy. Between July 2008 and March 2010, we screened 345 schizophrenia spectrum patients of either gender, aged between 18 and 65 years. A total of 276 consecutive outpatients who met the inclusion criteria and agreed to participate in the study were enrolled. They all fulfilled the formal Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) (APA, 2000) diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia. This diagnosis was confirmed by two expert clinicians (C.M., M.S.) using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) (First et al., 1997). Prior to this study, the interviewers received training sessions for the SCID. At the time of study entry, the patients had been clinically stable for at least 6 months, as judged by the treating psychiatrist. This result indicates that, during this period, all of the patients were treated as outpatients; their treatment regimens had not been modified; and there were no essential changes in their psychopathology. In addition to their medical records, all of the patients were considered to be in a stable state, as assessed from the reports of the patients themselves, as well as from the observations of the psychiatric staff, personnel in the psychiatric community, and relatives. Patients were evaluated using a semi-structured interview to assess their demographic and clinical features. Data were collected to determine age, gender, education, age at schizophrenia onset (report of first contact with a psychiatric service), and length of illness. Subjects were excluded if they had a current disorder other than schizophrenia on Axis I of the DSM-IV-TR (screened with the SCID), a current or past codiagnosis of autistic disorder or another pervasive developmental disorder, a history of severe head injury (coma ≥ 48 h), or a diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder due to a general medical condition. All of the patients were taking antipsychotic medication at the time of assessment. The two clinicians (C.M., M.S.) were aware of all previous diagnoses and were also able to review the previous clinical charts that were available for all patients.

Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects after a complete description of the study was provided. The study was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki in 1995 (as revised in Edinburgh in 2000) and was approved by the Local Research Ethics Committee (LREC).

# 2.2. Psychiatric assessment

The overall illness severity was rated using the Clinical Global Impression-Severity Scale (Guy, 1976). Current levels of psychopathological symptoms were assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) (Kay et al., 1987). Quality of life was evaluated using the Quality of Life Scale (QLS) (Heinrichs et al., 1984), which is a semistructured, clinician-rated interview that includes 21 items rated by the clinician on 7-point scales in the following 4 domains: interpersonal relations and social network (IRSN), instrumental role functioning (IRF), intrapsychic foundations (IF), and common objects and activities (COA). The items were rated from 0 to 6, with higher scores reflecting a better OOL.

All assessments were performed by two expert clinicians (C.M., M.S.). In an attempt to reduce inter-rater variability, all raters were trained to administer the psychometric tests according to common standards. Raters also participated in a pilot study to reach a consensus on the ratings that were obtained using psychometric scales. The procedure for this pilot study involved the authors completing independent ratings of interviews that were conducted with 15 patients. This procedure was followed by a discussion about each patient until consensus ratings were reached. In this study, the agreement within one point between the raters varied from 79 to 91% of the time for all items on the PANSS, with variations in the total QLS score occurring 91% of the time. Efforts were made to maintain inter-rater reliability throughout the entire study period, including the performance of careful calibration and use of standardization procedures and regular, in-depth reviews of a sample of interviews with the lead author.

## 2.3. Cognitive assessment

Neuropsychological tests were administered by two trained psychologists (B.C.; F.C.) who were unaware of the patients' clinical characteristics or the results of their psychiatric rating scores. The test battery was administered and scored according to standard instructions in the same way for all subjects on the day after the psychiatric assessments. The total testing time ranged from 1 to 2 h per patient (one or two sessions). None of the subjects were familiar with the tests.

To evaluate the subjects' attentive functions, we used the Stroop Test (Stroop, 1935) and the Trail Making Test (TMT) (Reitan, 1958). For the purpose of our analysis, we used the number of colors named on a conflicting card (Stroop CW), which is an index of the sensitivity to interference and/or response inhibition, and the TMT b-a score, which is calculated as the difference between TMT-B and TMT-A times, to assess divided attention and set shifting.

Verbal memory was assessed using the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT) (Delis et al., 1987) and, in particular, the total number of items correctly recalled over five learning trials (CVLT 1–5). To index the executive functions, we used the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) (Heaton et al., 1993) and considered the number of achieved sorting categories (WCST cat), which is usually regarded as the main benchmark for the evaluation of the WCST.

# 2.4. Statistical analysis

We used a 5-factor model proposed by van der Gaag et al. (2006) to cover all 30 items of the PANSS. The five component factors are as follows: positive symptoms, negative symptoms, disorganization, excitement, and emotional distress. In this model, the disorganization factor was composed of stereotyped thinking, poor attention, disorientation, conceptual disorganization, difficulty in abstraction, mannerism, lack of judgment and insight, disturbance of volition, and preoccupation.

Data are presented as the means ± standard deviations (SD) or percentages (%) unless stated otherwise.

Analyses were planned in the following three stages. In stage 1, univariate linear regression analyses between the variables of interest (disorganization, neurocognition, total and domain-specific QLS scores) and between these variables and potential confounders (age, education, positive symptoms, negative symptoms, excitement, and emotional distress) were conducted. In stage 2, a series of multiple regression analyses using a backward elimination procedure was performed to determine the cross-sectional determinants of QLS scores. The first and second hypotheses were tested using total and domain-specific QLS scores as dependent variables and any significant variables in the initial univariate analyses (p < 0.05) as predictors. The predictors included patient age, education, and clinical (disorganization, positive symptoms, negative symptoms, excitement, emotional distress) and cognitive variables. Backward stepwise regression begins with a full or saturated (all regression terms included) model and variables are progressively removed from the equation in an iterative process, at consecutive steps, eliminating those that fail to meet the specified criterion (usually a parameter estimate p-value <0.05). The fit of the model is tested after the elimination of each variable to ensure that the model still adequately fits the data. When no more variables can be eliminated from the model, the analysis has been completed. In stage 3, we performed mediational analyses using multiple regression analyses as specified by Baron and Kenny (1986). Mediation is said to occur when certain conditions are met, as follows: (1) the independent variable (IV) significantly predicts the dependent variable (DV) (path c or total effect); (2) the IV significantly predicts the potential mediator (M) (path a); (3) the M predicts the DV (path b); and (4) the effect of the IV on the DV is reduced when the M is included in the model (path c' or direct effect). Sobel tests for indirect effects were employed to determine whether this attenuation was significant and to determine whether M fully or partially mediated the relationship between the IV and the DV. We applied Sobel tests in order to decrease type I and type II error (Holmbeck, 1997).

Statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Science, SPSS, version 17 for Windows (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Sobel tests were computed with a SPSS macro developed by Preacher and Hayes (2004), into which certain statistics had to be entered as follows: (1) the unstandardized B coefficients for the relationships between the IV (the predictor) and the M; (2) the unstandardized B coefficients for the relationships between the IV and the DVs after controlling for the M; and (3) the standard errors of both unstandardized B coefficients. Sobel's significance test is both a test of the indirect effect of disorganization on the total QLS score, IRF, and IF (i.e., the product of the total disorganization -> M and M -> QLS scores, IRF, and IF pathways ) and a test of a decrease in the total effect of disorganization on the total QLS score, IRF, or IF after accounting for the M (i.e., total effect-direct effect). In other words, the decrease in the total effect is mathematically equivalent to the magnitude of the indirect effect, as the total effect - direct effect = the indirect effect (MacKinnon and Dwyer, 1993).

# 3. Results

The patients in our study had DSM IV-TR schizophrenia diagnoses of the paranoid subtype (n = 158, 57%), disorganized subtype (n = 27, 10%), undifferentiated subtype (n = 57, 21%), or residual subtype (n = 34, 12%). The mean age (±S.D.) of our patients was 40 (± 10.8) years. The mean duration of illness (±S.D.) was 14.2 (±9.74) years. There were 116 females (42%) and 160 males (58%). Sixty-two percent of patients were treated with second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), and 38% were treated with first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs). Subjects showed a moderate severity of symptoms, as assessed by the PANSS and CGI-S. The mean (± S.D.) QOL rating in our sample, as assessed by the total QLS score, reflects intermediate but quite significant levels of QOL impairment. The demographic and clinical features of our sample are presented in Table 1.

The results of the univariate linear regression analyses (Stage 1) are shown in Table 2.

Among the variables of interest that were significantly associated with QLS in the univariate analyses (p < 0.05) (Disorganization, Stroop CW; CVLT 1–5, TMT b–a), only two variables remained after backward selection (disorganization; CVLT 1–5) (Stage 2). All other variables were thus dropped from further mediational analyses.

To better understand the pattern of correlations among disorganization, CVLT 1-5 and QLS (total score, IRF, and IF), three mediational hypotheses were tested. The mediational models, with standardized (3s, are presented in Figs. 1-2. In our case, the IV was disorganization; the hypothetical M was CVLT 1-5; and the outcome variables, the DVs, were the total QLS score, IRF, and IF. First, we tested the effect of disorganization on QLS total score, IRF and IF (Fig. 1). The effect of disorganization was significant, showing that higher disorganization symptoms predicted lower QLS total score (β = - 0.500, S.E. = 0.173, p < 0.001; adjusted R2 = 0.303, accounting for 30.3% of the variance), IRF (ß = -0.425, S.E. = 0.045, p < 0.001; adjusted R4 = 0.177, accounting for 17.7% of the variance), and IF ({ = - 0.423, S.E. = 0.067, p < 0.001; adjusted R4 = 0.208, accounting for 20.8% of the variance) (step 1 of Baron and Kenny method). Second, we inserted in the model CVLT 1-5 as potential M of the effects of disorganization (Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 2, disorganization significantly predicted CVLT 1-5, with a higher severity of

Third, CVLT 1-5 predicted QLS total score, with higher CVLT 1-5 predicting higher QLS (ß = 0.219, S.E. = 0.101, p < 0.001), IRF (ß = 0.171, S.E. = 0.033, p = 0.004), and IF (ß = 0.187, S.E. = 0. 045, p = 0.001) scores (step 3 of Baron and Kenny method). Fourth, the direct coefficients (standardized Beta or ß coefficients) of Disorganization on QLS total score, IRF, and IF remained significant after inclusion of CVLT 1-5 as mediating variable, while they decreased somewhat in magnitude (ß from -0.500 to -0.471 for the total QLS score; ß from -0.425 to -0.373 for the IRF; {3 from -0.423 to -0.368 for the IF) (step 4 of Baron and Kenny method). In our prediction models, the adjusted Re value was 0.317 for the total QLS score model, accounting for 31.7% of the variance. In the IRF model, the adjusted R2 value was 0.181, accounting for 18.1% of the variance. Finally, in the IF model, the adjusted R2 value was 0.207, accounting for 20.7% of the variance.

However, the reduction of the direct effect of disorganization on QLS total score (z = 3.91, p < 0.001), on IRF (z = 6.02, p < 0.001), and on IF (z = 2.93, p = 0.003) was significant, providing further support for the hypothesis that CVLT 1-5 acts as a partial mediator between disorganization and the total QLS total score, IF, and IRF. Thus, it appears that CVLT 1-5 acts as a partial M and does not completely mediate the relationship between disorganization and the total QLS score, IRF, and IF.

# 4. Discussion

The purpose of the present study was to examine the interactions between disorganization and cognition in predicting QOL within a sample of outpatients with stable schizophrenia.

First, as hypothesized, disorganization was negatively related to QOL. In the literature, there is evidence that disorganization is the most reliable predictor of a variety of outcome indicators (Heslegrave et al., 1997; Norman et al., 1999; Smith et al., 1999; Ventura et al., 2009). Recently, Ventura et al. (2010) hypothesized that the close link between disorganization and outcome indicators may be due to the interference of disorganization symptoms on functional aspects of communication and social interactions, as well as to the lack of compensatory mechanisms. The strong, statistically significant correlation between disorganization and QOL in our study supports the necessity of dealing with disorganization as a separate positive symptom factor.

Another interesting finding of this study is the correlation of disorganization with QOL, particularly regarding the aspect of ""intrapsychic foundations"". This subscale identifies intrapsychic deficits that are seen as a core aspect of schizophrenia. The QLS intrapsychic foundations scale provides clinical judgment regarding intrapsychic elements in the dimensions of cognition, affectivity, and drive. A patient's sense of purpose, motivation, curiosity, empathy, ability to experience pleasure, and emotional interaction are assessed (Heinrichs et al., 1984). Intrapsychic foundations constitute the ""starting blocks"" from which the QLS dimensions measured by the other subscales are defined. Defects in these

areas are reflected in impairments in the other three categories. For example, an alteration of empathy can cause problems in interpersonal relationships, and a deficit of drive can have consequences in finding and maintaining work. Each of the disorganization symptoms, comprising a variety of abnormalities in the organization of thought, speech, and attention, suggests a diminishment or absence of organization. There seems to be a loss of the ability to be directed toward or committed to a particular focal topic or goal. Such conditions are likely to impact patients' drives or motivations to initiate goal-directed activities that could yield pleasurable opportunities. Anhedonia and deficits in the dimensions of drive and motivation are supposed to underlie the inability to engage with other people in a manner that is mutually rewarding (Strauss, 2012), which lies at the core of the functional disability of people with schizophrenia and leads to various challenges, such as extreme social isolation. It should be reiterated that disorganization reflects a characteristic, underlying dimension close to the core of the disease.

The ""instrumental role functioning"" domain of the discrete QLS focuses on the role of a worker, student, or housekeeper/parent. Judgments are made about level of accomplishment, degree of underemployment given the person's talents and opportunities, and satisfaction derived from his/her role (Heinrichs et al., 1984). A large number of studies have identified a strong association between greater symptom severity and lower employment rates (McGurk et al., 2004; Bond and Drake, 2008; Tsang et al., 2010). Patients in the present study had quite poor social and instrumental functioning, as evidenced by the low rate of employment (30%); disorganization may make occupational functioning much worse.

With regard to the second hypothesis, impaired verbal memory was related to a lower QOL. This finding is consistent with previous research and demonstrates a significant positive correlation between cognitive functioning and QOL. Studies have examined the role of cognitive variables in predicting social and community functioning, rehospitalization, vocational functioning, and QOL (Green et al., 2000). Verbal memory is among the strongest predictors of functional outcome and is associated with greater emotional discomfort, poorer QOL, worse clinical and community outcomes, improvement in work performance, inefficient social problem solving, and worse performance of daily life skills (Toulopoulou and Murray, 2004).

Furthermore, we found a negative association between disorganization and verbal memory. Several cross-sectional studies have suggested that the performance on neurocognitive tests is correlated with major symptom factors, positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and disorganization (Addington and Addington, 1999, 2000; Brazo et al., 2002, 2005). Most of the previous studies found a stronger cross-sectional relationship with negative symptoms than with positive symptoms of the non-disorganizing type (Keefe et al., 2006a,b). A recent meta-analysis conducted by Ventura et al. (2010) demonstrated a moderate relationship between disorganization and neurocognition, while the relationship between neurocognition and reality distortion was relatively weak. In this study, the authors found evidence that disorganization was related to all of the examined domains of cognitive functioning. This finding suggested that disorganization represents a separate set of positive symptoms from those associated with reality distortion and has independent links to neurocognition.

Finally, when verbal memory was inserted into the model as a mediating variable of the relationship between disorganization and QOL, we found evidence that verbal memory was a partial mediator of this relationship. Starting from the results of our mediation analysis, we can suggest that disorganization affected QOL both directly and indirectly via verbal memory. Our work contributes to a broad literature base that highlights the strength and importance of the psychopathological and neurocognitive symptoms in influencing QLS. Velligan et al. (1997) reported a path model in which cognition predicted both the concurrent symptomatology and activities of daily living. Bowie et al. (2006), utilizing a composite scale for neurocognition, reported that neuropsychological performance predicted functional capacity, which predicted the three domains of real-world functioning. Furthermore, three recent studies assessed the magnitude of the associations of psychiatric symptoms and neurocognition with the QLS. In the study of Lipkovich et al. (2009), the processing speed demonstrated direct and indirect effects via negative symptoms on three domains of functioning measured by the QLS at baseline and following 24 weeks of antipsychotic treatment. In the study of Mohamed et al. (2008), social or occupational functioning was significantly and independently associated with measures of both neurocognition and symptoms. Perlick et al. (2008), using data from a large randomized Department of Veterans Affairs trial of antipsychotic medication for schizophrenia, suggested that symptoms and neurocognition both have independent associations with functioning; in fact, symptoms may be even more strongly associated with functioning than neurocognition. More recently, Pandina et al. (2013) demonstrated that improved cognition was significantly correlated with positive changes in clinical and functional status in subjects with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. This may be linked to improvement in disorganized thoughts. In fact, in their study the neurocognitive composite score decreased by an estimated 0.81 unit when the PANSS disorganized thoughts factor score increased by 1 point.

A possible hypothesis to explain our finding is that verbal memory impairment and disorganization symptoms may be related to schizophrenia patients' deficits in cognitive control. Phillips and Silverstein (2003) have proposed that diverse cognitive dysfunctions may be related to dysfunctional coordination of the neural activity associated with contextually related stimuli, and that this underlies the phenomenological disorganization of mental processes in schizophrenia. Deficits in cognitive control could lead to the selection of inappropriate behavioral representations for ongoing actions in a manner that is likely to impact patients' social functioning (Chambon et al., 2008). Second, as suggested by Lysaker and Buck (2007), reduced memory functions could limit the acquisition of skills and the development of a rich personal narrative. Such conditions could lead to a habitually avoidant style of coping and a negatively modified self-concept, with a number of important implications on social functions and QOL.

Our study has a number of limitations that should be highlighted. First, its cross-sectional nature did not allow us to clarify the direction of causality in the observed disorganization-cognitive function-QOL relationships. Second, to be eligible for this study, patients had to meet the criteria for psychiatric stability and were taking medications. Consequently, they were not representative of patients in acute phases of the disease or in other clinical settings. Finally, in the discussion of our findings, we need to consider the possible limitations of the instrument we chose to explore QOL. We decided to use the QLS because it is considered a gold standard research instrument for the assessment of QOL in severely ill schizophrenia patients when administered by trained clinical raters (Cramer et al., 2000). The QLS is a ""disease-specific"" instrument that provides an ""external assessment"" of the QOL based on the patients' self-reports and perspectives, as well as the clinician's professional judgment about the patient's functioning and life cırcumstances. However, two main limitations of the QLS should be considered. First, because the QLS was initially devised as a measure of schizophrenic deficit syndrome, it has been suggested that apathy and other negative symptoms have substantial theoretical overlaps with certain constructs evaluated by the QLS, especially within the IF subscale. Second, the possibility of measurement overlaps between QOL and disorganization should be considered. Clinical judgment is involved in both QLS and PANSS, and one must be cautious of circular interpretations. Disorganization was the strongest symptom predictor of QLS in the sample after backward selection, accounting for 30.3% of the variance in the total QLS score in our sample. Although this finding may be interpreted in terms of measurement redundancy, it has been suggested that there is little reason to use a QOL scale that fails to detect the impact of symptoms specific to schizophrenia (Awad et al., 1997). Moreover, QLS and PANSS ratings were not obtained by independent raters, and information given in one interview could affect the assessment of another interview. An alternative, or complementary, approach would be to assess functioning through patient self-reports of subjective QOL. Indeed, it was reported that, in patients with schizophrenia, the subjective rating of QOL may be valid and informative in assessing life satisfaction (Jung et al., 2010). Thus, future studies that further explore the issue of the determinants of subjective and objective QOL in schizophrenia patients are needed.

Despite these limitations, there are some strengths of this study that should be noted. First, we decided to focus on disorganization, which is considered an important feature of schizophrenia but has been widely neglected in studies of QOL. Second, our study was conducted in a stable, homogeneous community sample that was reflective of baseline levels of functioning and impairment. This point is particularly important due to the presence of systematic differences in how QOL interacts with psychiatric symptoms among mixed samples of inpatients and outpatients or early course and chronic patients. Ignoring these differences would obscure the results (Eack and Newhill, 2007). Finally, the type of analysis conducted allowed us to explore possible moderators of the effect of psychiatric symptoms on QOL.

Taken together, the results of our study suggest that disorganization and QOL are associated in a manner partially mediated by verbal memory. Current antipsychotics show a greater efficacy for treating delusions and hallucinations than conceptual disorganization or cognitive impairments. A variety of psychological and social interventions are needed to optimize recovery and should constitute an essential part of schizophrenia treatment (cognitive-behavioral therapy, social skills training, family psychoeducation, assertive community treatment, and supportive employment). We can conclude that greater attention must be given to the systematic investigation and treatment of these symptoms, as the QOL in stable schizophrenia may be improved by

interventions targeting disorganization and verbal memory. Finally, we found a differential impact of disorganization on the dimensions of QOL, suggesting that. in schizophrenia. the dimensions of different symptoms could be related to specific OOL domains. In the future, further investigations conducted on different samples of patients and with different experimental designs are needed to confirm this hypothesis.

Background. Cognitive models postulate that negative-self-schemas (NSS) cause and maintain positive symptoms and that negative affect mediates this link. However, only few studies have tested the temporal mediation claim systematically using an appropriate design.

Methods. A longitudinal cohort design in an online community sample (N=%2) from Germany, Indonesia, and the USA was used. NSS, negative affect and positive symptoms were measured at four time-points (T0-T3) over a 1-year period. Cross-lagged panel and longitudinal mediation analyses with structural equation modeling were used to test the temporal mediation.

Results. Independent cross-lagged panel models showed a significant unidirectional longitudinal path from NSS to positive symptoms (T2-T3, ß=0.18, p<0.01) and bidirectional longitudinal associations from NSS to negative affect (TO-T1, y=0.14, p<0.01) and vice versa (TO-T1, y=0.01). There was also a significant indirect pathway from NSS at baseline via negative affect at T1 and T2 to positive symptoms at T3 (unstandardized indirect effect coefficient = 0.020, p < 0.05, BCa CI 0.004-0.035), indicating mediation.

Conclusions. Our findings support the postulated affective pathway from NSS to positive symptoms via negative affect. Specifically, our data indicate that NSS and negative affect influence each other and build up over the course of several months before leading on to positive symptoms. We conclude that interrupting this process by targeting NSS and negative affect early in the process could be a promising strategy to prevent the exacerbation of positive symptoms.

# Introduction

'(. . .) we are still without an explanation of the essential nature of delusion. The same may be said for the attempt to derive delusion from preceding affects ( ... ).' Jaspers (1963). We have come some way since this sobering evaluation by Jaspers in the 1960s. A number of theoretical models on the emergence of positive symptoms have been proposed synthesizing evidence on cognitive, social, and emotional processes from epidemiological, cross-sectional, experimental, and intervention studies (e.g. Garety et al. 2001; Beck & Rector, 2003; Kesting & Lincoln, 2013; Bentall et al. 2014; Howes & Murray, 2014). Although these models differ in emphasis, they cohere in stressing the importance of negative affect and extreme negative beliefs

about the self [negative-self-schemas (NSS)] in explaining the exacerbation of psychosis.

In one of the first and most widely cited of these models, positive symptoms are postulated to be both exacerbated and maintained by NSS, resulting from external stressors and social adversity (Garety et al. 2001). Specifically, the model postulates a unidirectional pathway from NSS to symptoms, which is mediated by negative affect. This model has been cited more than 500 times according to Web of Science since its publication in 2001. It has been immensely important to inform CBTp (cognitive behavioral therapy for psychosis) that lays an emphasis on changing dysfunctional beliefs about the self and now is recommended as a first-line treatment for psychosis (National Institute for Health & Clinical Excellence, 2009). In a recent model, Howes & Murray (2014) integrate the perspective originally proposed in cognitive models of psychosis, e.g. (Garety et al. 2001, 2007; Morrison, 2001; Beck & Rector, 2002,

2003) with socio-developmental (van Os et al. 2010; Bentall et al. 2014), and neural (Kapur et al. 2005) explanations of psychosis. They postulate that childhood adversity both sensitizes the dopamine system, resulting in excessive dopamine synthesis and aberrant assignment of salience to stimuli, and biases the cognitive schema that the individual uses to interpret experiences in a way that renders paranoid interpretations more likely.

The central postulates related to the cognitive processes in these models are that: (1) social stressors result in NSS, (2) that NSS precede and cause symptoms via affective states. Whereas the first postulate has been backed up by evidence in a rigorous 30-year longitudinal study (Fergusson et al. 2013), the second has found some support but lacks evidence from compelling longitudinal studies. Specifically, the postulate that NSS play an important role in the emergence of symptoms has been supported by the finding that decreases in self-esteem precede paranoid symptoms within brief intervals in daily life (Thewissen et al. 2011) and in experimental studies (e.g. Kesting et al. 2013) and over the course of months in a longitudinal study (Fowler et al. 2012). Similarly, experience sampling studies show that negative affect precedes the emergence of paranoia in daily life (Ben-Zeev et al. 2011; Thewissen et al. 2011; Kramer et al. 2013) and two longitudinal studies found anxiety and depression to predict paranoia over the course of several months (Fowler et al. 2012; Oliver et al. 2012). However, the only study that investigated the role of negative affect as a mediator of the longitudinal association between NSS and positive symptoms (Oliver et al. 2012) used a design with only two assessment points (T1, T2). They found a unidirectional association between NSS (T1) and delusional ideation (T2) in university students from the UK and New Zealand, which was fully mediated by anxiety (T2), but not by depression. Although the findings are promising, it needs noting that the design was not ideally suited to establish whether changes in negative affect follow NSS and precede increases in symptoms, as a rigorous test of this assumption requires at least three assessment points.

Furthermore, most of the accumulated evidence on the association between NSS and positive symptoms is based on narrow single subpopulations of people from white, educated, industrialized, rich, democratic countries, which may not be generalizable to other subpopulations (Henrich et al. 2010). Because culture is likely to play a role in the way psychotic experiences are appraised and maintained (e.g. Luhrmann et al. 2015), investigating the antecedents of symptoms in culturally broader samples is necessary to arrive at generalizable findings.

In the face of the existing state of research, we agree with Howes & Murray (2014) who concede that further evidence to support the proposal that schemas are biased before the onset of psychosis is needed. Clarifying whether NSS and negative affect are predictors of positive symptoms or consequences makes a large difference to the way we understand and treat positive symptoms of psychosis. If the postulated causal pathway from NSS to symptoms via affect is confirmed, this implies that a therapeutic focus on selfschema and affect in the pre-morbid phase could be an effective way to prevent the development of the full clinical disorder. In contrast, if negative affect and NSS temporally follow the experience of positive symptoms, then the more plausible approach would be to continue to focus on reducing symptoms and enhancing patients' coping abilities.

The present study thus tested the following hypotheses using auto-regressive cross-lagged path analysis with four evenly spaced assessment points across 12 months in large community samples from Germany, Indonesia, and the USA: (1) NSS longitudinally predict positive symptoms and (2) the association between NSS and symptoms is longitudinally mediated by negative affect.

# Method

## Participants and procedure

Participants from Germany, Indonesia, and the USA were recruited through Crowdflower, a crowdsourcing website, and other websites (e.g. internet forums and social networking websites) to complete an anonymous 30-min online survey. Only participants who agreed with the consent statements and reported to be above 18 years of age were included. After completing the baseline survey (TO), participants were invited via email to complete a follow-up survey after 4 (T1), 8 (T2), and 12 months (T3). Participants who completed the baseline survey received an invitation to the follow-up surveys. Participants recruited from Crowdflower received 0.50 US\$ for completing the baseline survey (T0) following the median hourly wage typical of online recruitment platforms (Buhrmester et al. 2011). To motivate participation in follow-ups, the compensation was increased subsequently (T1, 0.60 US\$; T2, 0.80 US\$; T3, 1.00 US\$). Participants recruited from other websites could not be given compensation for reasons of data protection. The study received ethical approval from the German Psychological Society.

There were 2501 completed baseline survey entries of which 151 were excluded due to duplicate entries [n=98), longstring (i.e. providing the same answer

consecutively for 50 items, n = 46, see Johnson (2005)], and inconsistent answers (n = 7). The baseline (T0) sample consisted of 2350 participants of whom 720 participants completed the English, 786 the German and 844 the Indonesian version of the survey, 1447 of these participants responded at T1 (response rate=61.6%), 1244 at T2 (response rate=52.9%), and 943 at T3 (response rate=40.1%). The participants who responded to the invitation were then subjected to the same inclusion criteria (i.e. complete entry, no longstring, consistent answers). Based on these criteria, there were 682 participants at T1, 409 at T2, and 366 at T3, of which 135 participants completed all follow-up assessments. A detailed participant flowchart following the STROBE (STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology) guideline (Vandenbroucke et al. 2007) is available in the Supplementary (Fig. S1). For the current analysis, we included participants who participated in at least one follow-up survey (n=962) of whom 302 participants completed the English, 312 the German and 348 the Indonesian version of the survey.+1

# Measures

Back-translation procedure and cultural adaption of measures were conducted by native Germans, British and Indonesians according to a guideline (Schmitt & Eid, 2007). A complete description of the scale and scoring procedure is available from the corresponding author.

NSS were measured with the negative-self subscale from the Brief Core Schema Scale (BCSS, Fowler et al. 2006). The subscale comprised six items (e.g. 'I am unloved') rated on a 5-point Likert scale from 'no, do not believe it' to 'yes, believe it totally'. Good validity and reliability of the scale have been reported (Fowler et al. 2006). The negative-other subscale was not included in the main analysis because the focus was on self-related schema and the items of the negativeother (e.g. 'Other people are devious', 'Other people are hostile') resemble some of the items assessing paranoid thoughts in the Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences (CAPE, Stefanis et al. 2002), which impedes on the interpretability of associations found. However, the results of the analysis for negative-other schemas can be found in the Supplementary Tables (S8-S12) and are discussed in the Supplementary Text (S3).

Anxiety was measured with the seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale (GAD-7, Spitzer et al. 2006) that includes items such as 'Feeling nervous, anxious or on edge'. Depression was measured with

the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) that is based on the DSM-IV criteria for depression (Kroenke et al. 2001) with items such as 'Feeling down, depressed, or hopeless'. For both scales the instruction was as follows: 'Over the last 4 weeks, how often have you been bothered by any of the following problems?' on a 4-point Likert scale from 'not at all' to 'nearly every day'. Both scales have been shown to have good reliability and validity in large representative population samples (Martin et al. 2006; Löwe et al. 2008). Negative affect was defined as the combined sum-score of the PHQ-9 and GAD-7.

Positive symptoms were measured with the 20-item positive symptom subscale from the CAPE (Stefanis et al. 2002), which assesses a range of symptoms, such as paranoia (e.g. 'Have you ever felt that you were being persecuted in any way?') and hallucinations (e.g. 'Do you ever hear voices when you are alone?'). The items were answered on a 4-point Likert scale from 'never' to 'nearly always' to measure the frequency of the occurrence of symptoms and from 'not distressed' to 'very distressed' to measure the appraisal of symptoms. The frequency and distress scales were combined into a weighted score reflecting the severity of each symptom, specifically by multiplying an item's frequency score with its associated distress score. For example, if an individual reported that they 'sometimes' heard voices (frequency score of 2) and were 'quite distressed' by this experience (distress score of 3), they would receive a severity score of 6. The final score was the sum of severity scores. The German and English versions of the CAPE demonstrate good validity and reliability (Brenner et al. 2007; Schlier et al. 2015).

#### Analyses

We examined the temporal relationships between NSS, negative affect and positive symptoms using crosslagged panel models. Cross-lagged panel models are ideal for examining temporal associations between two variables, because they take various sources of error, such as the stability of the variables, crosssectional associations, and prior associations into account.

Before computing the cross-lagged panel models, we tested two preconditions: (1) a saturated model that assumes all variables are significantly inter-correlated cross-sectionally and across all assessment points; (2) a within-construct longitudinal model to estimate the extent to which past scores on a variable predict temporally following scores on that variable (e.g. NSS at T0 predict NSS at T1).

Before computing the longitudinal mediation model, three preconditions for mediation derived from Baron

<sup>†</sup> The notes appear after the main text.

& Kenny's (1986) causal steps approach were established, using cross-lagged panel models: (1) NSS longitudinally predict positive symptoms (path c, see Fig. 1a); (2) NSS longitudinally predict negative affect (path a, see Fig. 1b); (3) negative affect longitudinally predicts positive symptoms (path b, see Fig. 1c). In each step, we also tested for the possibility of reverse pathways.

The longitudinal mediation analysis followed the suggestions by Preacher (2015) in constructing the appropriate cross-lagged panel models (see Fig. 2, for the full statistical model, see Supplementary Fig. S2). Moreover, following Mayer et al. (2014) we used indirect effect size estimates to confirm whether a variable is a mediator. Because we did not have time-specific hypotheses regarding the temporal mediation pathways (e.g., that the mediation via negative affect only occurs within the first 8 months), we computed and reported all possible indirect pathways and their respective effect size coefficients. The indirect effect coefficients were considered significant if the biascorrected bootstrap 95% confidence interval (BCa CI) did not include zero (Cheung & Lau, 2008).

All of the analyses were conducted with structural equation modeling (SEM) using the lavaan package ver. 0.5-22 (Rosseel, 2012) in R version 3.2.3. Reported path coefficients (y and ß) are completely standardized. Reported overall total effect, overall direct effect, and overall indirect effect coefficients are unstandardized. The following fit indices along with the proposed cut-off criteria were used to assess the fit between hypothesized models and the data: CFI> 0.95, RMSEA<0.06, and SRMR<0.08 (Hu & Bentler, 1999). The x is reported but not used as a fit criterion because it tends to reject models that are based on large sample sizes (Bentler & Bonett, 1980). All analyses were estimated using maximum-likelihood procedure with standard errors based on the first-order derivatives.

Little's missing completely at random (MCAR) test indicated that NSS, negative affect, and positive symptoms across measurement time points were MCAR [x (45) = 54.18, p = 0.16]. However, the MCAR assumption was not supported when we looked at the correlations of various variables of interest with missing status. Furthermore, we found that individuals who did not complete any follow-up assessment in comparison to those who did were significantly younger and more likely to be male, as well as to have lower socio-economic status and more pronounced positive symptoms. However, they did not significantly differ in regard to NSS negative affect presence of diagnosis of any lifetime mental disorder, or presence of a diagnosis of schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders (see Supplementary Text S2 for details, and Supplementary Table S1 in correlation format). Consequently, the more

conservative full information maximum likelihood (FIML) with missing at random (MAR) assumption was used.

# Results

# Participant characteristics

The participants were 34.4 years old on average and 45.6% were female. Generally, the participants tended to have a somewhat higher education, but a lower income in comparison with their national averages (see Supplementary Text S1). The employment status was diverse with 31.8% workers, 23.1% office employees, 14.9% university students, 6.9% self-employed, 6.0% helping family members (e.g. housewife), 5.4% freelancers, 7.6% were unemployed, and 4.3% other. Moreover, 31.2% of the participants reported a lifetime mental diagnosis, and 3.3% participants reported to have a current diagnosis of a psychotic disorder. Detailed participant characteristics are provided in Table 1.

## Preconditions for cross-lagged panel models

First, saturated models showed that NSS, negative affect, and positive symptoms were significantly correlated with each other within and across time points (see Supplementary Table S2). Second, withinconstruct longitudinal models showed that previous measures significantly predicted subsequent measures for all variables of interest (see Supplementary Table S3) indicating that these constructs are stable over time to a certain extent. In addition, all fit indices of the cross-lagged panel models tested below (sections 'Preconditions for longitudinal mediation analysis' and 'Longitudinal mediation') met at least two out of three goodness of fit criteria (see notes of Figs 1 and 2), indicating that all parameter estimates can be interpreted.

# Preconditions for longitudinal mediation analysis

First, NSS significantly predicted positive symptoms at the following time-points. In contrast, there were no significant reverse pathways from positive symptoms to NSS (for details see Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table S4). Second, NSS significantly predicted negative affect at the following time-points. One of the four possible reverse paths from negative affect to NSS was also significant indicating reverse causation (for details see Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table S5). Third, we found that negative affect significantly predicted positive symptoms at the following time-points. There were no significant reverse pathways from positive symptoms to negative affect (for details see Fig. 1c and Supplementary Table S6).

#### Longitudinal mediation

The longitudinal mediation model is shown in Fig. 2 (more details are available in Supplementary Table S7). As apparent in Fig. 2, there are three possible

indirect pathways from NSS at T0 via negative affect to positive symptoms at T3, of which one was significant, one was trend-level significant and one was nonsignificant. First, the indirect effect consisting of the
pathway from NSS at T0 to negative affect at T1, then from negative affect at T1 to negative affect at T2, and finally from negative affect at T2 to positive symptoms at T3 was significant (0.020, p < 0.05, 95% BCa CI, 0.004, 0.035). Second, the indirect effect consisting of pathways from NSS at T0 to NSS at T1, then from NSS at T1 to negative affect at T2, and finally from negative affect at T2 to positive symptoms at T3 was trend-level significant (0.021, p=0.06, 95% BCa CI -0.001 to 0.042). Third, the indirect effect consisting of pathways from NSS at T0 to negative affect at T1, then from negative affect at T1 to positive symptoms at T2, and finally from positive symptoms at T2 to positive symptoms at T3 was not significant (-0.001, p=0.15, 95% BCa CI -0.022 to 0.003). Furthermore, the pattern of results remained the same if we modeled the covariates (age, sex, and socioeconomic status) to be correlated (bivariate, and the direction of the relationship was not assumed) with NSS, negative affect and positive symptoms at all time points, but not to be correlated with each other.

# Discussion

Informed by cognitive models of psychosis (particularly Garety et al. 2001) this study set out to investigate the postulate that NSS precede symptoms and that negative affect mediates this association over the course of 1 year in a large multi-national sample. As hypothesized, we found a unidirectional, longitudinal pathway from NSS to positive symptoms. Together with previous work that provides support for a unidirectional pathway from NSS to paranoia (Fowler et al. 2012; Oliver et al. 2012), we now have an increasing body of evidence pointing to a temporal precedence of NSS in the formation and maintenance of positive symptoms as postulated by the cognitive models (e.g. Garety et al. 2001). Moreover, we could ascertain that this link is uni directional as we found no significant reverse pathways from positive symptoms to NSS. Finally, we confirmed one of the cognitive models' core assumptions, namely that negative affect longitudinally mediates the path from NSS to positive symptoms.

Interestingly, the bidirectional pathways in the independent cross-lagged panel models suggest that NSS and negative affect enhance each other over time, although further research with larger samples is required to confirm this assumption. Our findings indicate that it takes a certain amount of time (about 8 months in our study) before this build-up of negative affect and NSS leads on to psychotic symptoms. This observation is in line with the clinical observation that patients with psychosis often present with problems related to anxiety or depression first, before

developing psychotic disorders at a later time-point (Häfner et al. 2013). For example, in the Dutch Early Detection and Intervention Evaluation (EDIE-NL) trial more than 50% of the identified prodromal schizophrenia patients had a diagnosis of an anxiety disorder, depressive disorder, or both (van der Gaag et al. 2012a). Furthermore, the majority of individuals with an at-risk mental state have been found to have anxiety and/or depressive disorders (Fusar-Poli et al. 2014). However, it is important to note that these disorder statuses were not found to increase the risk of transition to psychosis (Fusar-Poli et al. 2017).

Moreover, our findings suggest that NSS and negative affect precede positive symptoms rather than vice versa. This indicates that they are likely to play a causal role in symptom formation, although we acknowledge that further criteria are required to ascertain causality with more clarity (Reininghaus et al. 2016). Previous cognitive models have often postulated a vicious cycle relationship between NSS, negative attect and positive symptoms by claiming that the same factors that precede symptoms are responsible for maintaining them (e.g. Garety et al. 2007; Kesting & Lincoln, 2013). However, neither our study nor other studies (Fowler et al. 2012; Oliver et al. 2012) support the notion that positive symptoms are followed by increased NSS or more negative affect. Thus, it appears that NSS make people vulnerable to having positive symptoms, but that positive symptoms do not necessarily cause people to feel worse or to see themselves in a more negative way. This does not exclude the possibility that longer-term consequences of positive symptoms (e.g. being hospitalized, stigmatized, medicated, socially excluded, etc.) will have a detrimental effect on affect and self-schemas, but this would require studies looking at even longer time-periods and selecting a sample that scores on the more severe end of the psychosis continuum. This type of research could also be combined with a PET methodology to investigate the maintenance mechanism as postulated by Howes & Murray (2014), namely that paranoia and hallucinations cause further stress, leading to the repeated dopamine dysregulation which hardwires the psychotic beliefs. Moreover, future studies are needed to clarify the role of social factors in the postulated cognitive and affective pathway to psychosis. A specific question is whether social disadvantage impacts directly on psychosis by being linked to other social adversity (Morgan et al. 2010; 2014), or more indirectly via emotion (Gevonden et al. 2015; Lincoln et al. 2017), schemas (Jaya et al. 2016) or a combination of several mediators.

In this context, we would also like to use our findings to spark a discussion on the consideration of time in cognitive models of psychosis. Psychological

theories in general have been criticized to lack consideration of time (Cole & Maxwell, 2003), and this shortcoming has only been recently addressed in the context of psychosis. Putative psychological mechanisms of psychosis may take place at a distal macrolevel and/ or at a more proximal microlevel (Reininghaus et al. 2016). For example, brief setbacks in self-esteem have been shown to trigger an immediate increase in paranoid beliefs at a micro level in experimental (Kesting et al. 2013) and in experience sampling studies (Thewissen et al. 2011). Similarly, negative emotional states have been shown to play an important role in the development of psychosis at the microlevel, in the sense that increases in negative emotions tend to be followed by proximal increases on state symptom measures (Lincoln et al. 2009; Kramer et al. 2013). However, these studies do not investigate how NSS and negative affect influence symptoms over longer time-periods. Our findings, in contrast, focus on the macrolevel and indicate NSS and negative affective states to build up over a period of months before they have a meaningful impact on positive symptoms. Thus, it seems that in the case of negative aftect and NSS both macro- and microlevel mechanisms could be involved and it would be interesting to further pursue this question in future studies.

# Strengths and limitations

A strength of the study is that the participants covered different regions and cultures. Moreover, they covered the whole psychosis continuum including the severe end as indicated by a relatively high prevalence of individuals with a diagnosis of a psychotic disorder (3.3%). Looking at associations across the continuum is advantageous when it comes to investigating putative mechanisms, because the findings can be interpreted free of issues that often influence studies comparing clinical to non-clinical populations, such as selective small samples, stigma, and medication. Another strength is the careful consideration of the temporal aspect of measurement and assessment points. The specific and uniform reference to the past four weeks in all measurements and assessment points along with the evenly spaced assessment points allowed us to investigate temporal pathways between NSS, negative affect and psychotic symptoms repeatedly under uniform conditions.

A limitation is that the recruiting method limited participants to those with access to the internet. Furthermore, although we oversampled participants with schizophrenia spectrum disorders to have sufficient variation in symptoms, the rate of overall psychopathology in our sample was comparable to typical samples reported in epidemiological studies. For example, 29% of the participants in the study reported a life-time mental disorder diagnosis, which is similar to the rates presented in representative population samples (Kessler et al. 2005). Notably, subgroup analyses of samples that differ in their position along the continuum are needed to test whether the temporal mechanisms are comparable between the 'lower' and the 'higher' end of the continuum, the latter likely being faced with additional problems that impact on affect (e.g. medication) and self-schemas (e.g. stigma). A reverse causality mechanism may be particularly likely for people at the 'higher' end of the continuum.

Another aspect worthy of discussion is that crosslagged panel analysis has been noted to overestimate the stability coefficients of constructs and to underestimate the cross-lagged paths (Cole & Maxwell, 2003). This means that the coefficients of the main results (e.g. from negative affect to positive symptoms) presented are conservative and might be underestimated. This could also be the reason why not all of the possible mediation paths were significant. Moreover, our analysis of the missing data pattern showed a tendency of participants with severe symptoms to drop out at follow-up. We attempted to correct for this by estimating the missing data using FIML procedure, but can nevertheless not rule out an underestimation of all lagged pathways due to a reduction of follow-up data variability.

Finally, while the current study has participants from different regions and cultures, it was not designed to investigate differences in strengths of associations and mediation hypotheses between the different countries, which would have required larger sample sizes.

# Conclusion

Our study design allows us to conclude that NSS precede symptoms and that this link is mediated by negative affect. This finding confirms a core assumption of cognitive models of psychosis and refines them further by showing that the mechanism applies unidirectionally and in the time-period of months. Our results suggest that interventions that target NSS and negative affect could have a buffering effect, reducing and preventing positive symptoms.

The value of intervening at the mediating mechanism, negative affect, as a strategy to reduce positive symptoms has been demonstrated in a couple of pioneering trials that target depression and anxiety in patients with psychotic disorders. The most convincingly designed among these studies compared a brief intervention targeting worry to standard care in a sample of 150 patients with persecutory delusions and was able to demonstrate that focusing solely on

worry was successful in reducing paranoid ideation (Freeman et al. 2015). In fact, the results of the mediation analysis in Freeman's study showed that 66% of the intervention's effect on delusions was explicable by reductions in worry. Studies focusing on depression (van der Gaag et al. 2012b; Moritz et al. 2016) have provided more mixed findings, showing improvements in mood but not in psychotic symptoms. However, this might be due to a lack of study power (i.e. van der Gaag et al. 2012b) or the fact that the intervention was delivered online (i.e. Moritz et al. 2016). Further adequately designed research is thus required in order to test which affective processes should be targeted and how to have a sustainable effect on positive symptoms. Another important therapeutic implication could be to target NSS in order to prevent or reduce positive symptoms. Again, there is a pioneering work by Freeman et al. (2014) investigating the impact of an intervention aimed to improve self-related beliefs in patients with persecutory delusions. However, they did not find a significant effect of the intervention, neither on NSS or paranoia at a 1 month follow-up assessment, which the authors discussed as being due to the brevity of the intervention (six sessions in 8 weeks). Thus, developing interventions that are successful to improve self-schemas and testing their impact on positive symptoms remains a challenge for future research, which is not only clinically relevant but also an important piece of evidence in asserting causality (Reininghaus et al. 2016).

Given that we found the associations of NSS, affect and symptoms across the entire continuum, focusing on NSS and negative affect as a strategy to prevent symptom formation before the development of a full psychotic disorder could be particularly promising. This could be done by screening for risk-indicators at the level of schools, universities or other institutions and offering low-threshold interventions that focus on improving self-schemas and reducing anxiety and depression in those who show elevated levels of negative affect or NSS. This type of primary prevention might help to prevent progression to an at risk status or from the psychosis prodrome to the full disorder.

Background. Impulsivity is a hallmark characteristic of substance use disorders. Recently, studies have begun to explore whether increased impulsivity in substance-dependent individuals (SDIs) is associated with a greater propensity to relapse following treatment. Despite growing recognition of its multidimensional nature, however, most studies have treated impulsivity unilaterally. Accordingly, it remains unclear whether certain facets of impulsivity are more relevant to relapse than others. The aim of the current study was to examine the relationship between multiple facets of impulsivity and short-term relapse in SDIs. As a secondary aim, we explored the role of treatment retention in this relationship.

Method. A personality-based impulsivity questionnaire (UPPS) and three neurocognitive tasks of impulsivity [stopsignal task (SST), delay discounting task (DDT) and lowa gambling task (IGT)] were administered in a heterogeneous sample of 70 SDIs shortly following their entry in an in-patient detoxification programme. Mediation analyses were performed to explore whether the effects of impulsivity on relapse were mediated by treatment retention.

Results. Performance on two neurocognitive indice (i.e. delay discounting and impulsive decisionmaking) significantly predicted short-term relapse. The effects of delay discounting and impulsive decision-making on relapse propensity were mediated by treatment retention.

Conclusions. Neurocognitive indices of impulsivity may be more sensitive to the prediction of relapse than trait-based self-report questionnaires. Post-treatment relapse in SDIs may be reduced by targeting the processes involved in impulsive choice and by improving treatment retention in SDIs with inflated impulsivity.

## Introduction

Impulsivity plays a critical role in the establishment and maintenance of drug addiction (Belin et al. 2008, 2011; Everitt et al. 2008; Bird & Schenk, 2013). Recently, studies have begun to examine whether increased impulsivity among substance-dependent individuals (SDIs) is also associated with a greater propensity to relapse following treatment discharge (Bowden-Jones et al. 2005; Passetti et al. 2008, 2011; De Wilde et al. 2013; Stevens et al. 2014). Given that impulsivity is amenable to treatment (Alfonso et al. 2011; Bickel et al. 2011), a better understanding of its

involvement in relapse propensity may have important clinical implications.

Impulsivity, however, is a multidimensional construct, which includes different biologically based and heritable components (Evenden, 1999; Whiteside & Lynam, 2001; Dawe & Loxton, 2004; Reynolds et al. 2006; Mole et al. 2014). Often, a distinction is made between personality-based and neurocognitive dimensions (Goudriaan et al. 2008; Sharma et al. 2014). From a personality perspective, impulsivity is generally perceived as a trait that is fairly stable over time and evident across a range of situations. Dimensions of trait impulsivity are manifold and include: (1) lack of premeditation; (2) lack of perseverance; (3) sensation or novelty seeking; and (4) difficulties in resisting strong impulses driven by negative or positive affect (i.e. urgency) (Zuckerman et al. 1978; Eysenck & Eysenck, 1985; Patton et al. 1995;

Whiteside & Lynam, 2001). Trait impulsivity is typically measured using self-report questionnaires, which assess subjective views and include questions that cover broad periods of time. From a neurocognitive perspective, impulsivity is generally perceived as a transitory state, sensitive to environmental and personal influences. As a state, impulsivity is typically assessed using neurocognitive tasks, which measure specific behavioural processes (Verdejo-Garcia et al. 2008). Often, a distinction is made between two neurocognitive expressions of impulsivity: impulsive action and impulsive choice (Winstanley et al. 2006). The former refers to poor inhibitory control and the latter refers to impulsive decisions, often due to a distorted evaluation of delayed consequences (Dalley et al. 2011). The distinction between impulsive action and impulsive choice has been justified by animal studies showing that both constructs are involved in distinct stages of the addiction cycle and recruit different brain circuitries and may be susceptible to distinct pharmacological influences (Diergaarde et al. 2008; Paterson et al. 2011; Broos et al. 2012). Accordingly, an examination of the relative contribution of separate aspects of impulsivity to the propensity to relapse in drug users could lead to the development of more specific therapies to improve addiction treatment outcomes. Still, the majority of previous studies have treated impulsivity unilaterally (see Stevens et al. 2014). Similarly, personality and neurocognitive research traditions on impulsivity have historically remained largely independent (Sharma et al. 2014), despite evidence suggesting that self-report and neurocognitive assessments of impulsivity represent different levels of analyses (Reynolds et al. 2006; Sharma et al. 2014). Whereas preliminary evidence in pathological gamblers suggests that neurocognitive indices of impulsivity may be more promising in the prediction of relapse than personality-based self-report questionnaires (Goudriaan et al. 2008), it remains largely unknown whether each assessment strategy is tapping unique variance in relapse. Another notable limitation of previous studies on the relationship between impulsivity and relapse is that potential mediating effects of treatment retention, i.e. the number of days spent in treatment, have rarely been taken into account. Given the growing evidence indicating that impulsivity negatively affects treatment retention on the one hand (see Stevens et al. 2014), and the robust association between retention and post-treatment relapse on the other hand (Zhang et al. 2003), apparent effects of impulsivity on relapse propensity may result from shorter stays in treatment and, thus, less treatment exposure in the most impulsive patients.

In the current study, we explicitly adopted a multidimensional impulsivity approach while examining the

relationship between impulsivity and post-treatment relapse among SDIs. We used a test battery comprising measures that are believed to index core aspects of impulsivity, including trait and neurocognitive indices. As a secondary aim, we wanted to explore whether the relationship between impulsivity and post-treatment relapse would be mediated by treatment retention. Based upon previous findings in the animal literature (e.g. Broos et al. 2012), we hypothesized that impulsive choice but not impulsive action would significantly contribute to the prediction of post-treatment relapse. We further reasoned that neurocognitive measures of impulsivity would outperform trait measures of impulsivity in predicting relapse, since neurocognitive measures tap more directly into the endophenotype of impulsivity. A third prediction was that any observed effects of impulsivity on relapse would be mediated by treatment retention.

# Method

#### Participants

Participants were recruited from three in-patient detoxification programmes. Individuals were included if they met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association, 1994) criteria for any current substance dependence and if they were abstinent for at least 3 days. Individuals were excluded if they (a) had an intelligence quotient (IQ) below 70 or did not have sufficient comprehension of the Dutch language to understand test instructions, (b) had a history of neurological condition, or (c) had a past or current DSM-IV diagnosis of psychotic disorders. None of the participants was being treated with psychostimulants before or at the time of assessment.

#### Treatment programme/setting

The detoxification programme included (medical) management of withdrawal symptoms, crisis support with respect to various life areas (e.g. medical, social, administrative), enhancement of abstinence motivation, information and advice with regard to further treatment options and support in the referral to these long-term follow-up treatment options. All centres required complete abstinence from drugs and alcohol, with the exception of caffeine and nicotine. Residents were not permitted to leave the centre grounds during treatment. Regular drug testing was further provided and any substance use was grounds for dismissal from the detoxification centre. Treatment in these centres typically lasts between 5 and 6 weeks. In terms of their approach, the detoxification centres were strongly based on therapeutic community concepts (De Leon, 2000).

## Instruments

#### Background characteristics

Sections of the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.-plus; Sheehan et al. 1998) were used to assess substance dependence and to obtain diagnoses for current or lifetime depression, psychotic disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and antisocial personality disorder. Data on education and information regarding drug use were assessed using a Dutch version of the European Addiction Severity Index (Europ-ASI), a semi-structured clinical assessment interview (McLellan et al. 1980; Raes et al. 2008). Additional information about the frequency, amount and duration of drug use was collected using the Interview for Research on Addictive Behavior (IRAB; Verdejo-Garcia et al. 2005). IQ was estimated using two subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, third edition (WAIS-III; Wechsler, 1997; WAIS-III, Dutch version, Swets Test Publishers, 2000): matrix reasoning and information. The estimated IQ obtained with this dyadic short form correlates 0.92 with the full-scale IQ scores (Ringe et al. 2002).

#### Impulsivity

Trait impulsivity. The UPPS (Whiteside & Lynam, 2001) is a self-report questionnaire containing 45 items, rated on a four-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly agree) to 4 (strongly disagree). The questionnaire comprises four subscales corresponding to the four distinct personality dimensions of impulsivity as identified through factor analysis (Whiteside & Lynam, 2001): urgency (12 items); lack of premeditation (11 items); lack of perseverance (10 items); and sensation seeking (12 items). Higher scores indicate higher levels of trait impulsivity.

Neurocognitive dimensions of impulsivity: impulsive action. Inhibition of a pre-potent response was measured by a stop-signal task (SST), operated using E-Prime experiment generation software (for more detailed information, see Goudriaan et al. 2008). Stop-signals were presented using a tracking algorithm (Logan et al. 1984), a procedure that dynamically adjusts the delay between the onset of the go-signal (i.e. the presentation of the airplane) and the onset of the stop-signal to control inhibition probability. The main dependent variable representing inhibitory control, the stop-signal reaction time (SSRT), reflects the time needed to inhibit the pre-potent response once the stop-signal occurs. Longer SSRTs reflect worse inhibitory control.

Neurocognitive dimensions of impulsivity: impulsive choice. The delay discounting task (DDT) measures the ability of individuals to tolerate a delay in order to obtain a larger reward instead of a smaller, immediately available reward. A computerized version of the task was administered using E-Prime experiment generation software. Participants completed six session blocks with eight preference judgment trials per block. On each trial, subjects were presented with a choice between a future reward (option 1) and an immediate reward (option 2). The future or delayed reward (i.e. option 1) was the same for all trials of a given block (i.e. 506, 476, 524, 512, 520, 488 euro), with a block-specific delay in days (i.e. 5, 30, 180, 365, 1095, 3650 days) for blocks 1-6, respectively. The value of the immediate reward was adjusted from trial to trial (depending on the responses made by the subjects) until it was deemed by the participant to be equivalent to the value of the delayed reward (the exact adjustments can be found in Wittmann et al. 2007). The k value was used as the dependent variable. As k increases, the person discounts future rewards more steeply. Accordingly, higher k values correspond to higher levels of impulsive choice. Because k values (discount rates) had a positively skewed distribution, statistical analyses were performed on the natural logarithmic transformation of these values: ln(k + 0.001).

The Iowa gambling task (IGT) was administered in order to measure impulsive decision-making. Subjects had to choose between four decks of cards: decks A, B, C and D. Unbeknownst to the participant, two decks (i.e. A and B) gave high rewards, but also resulted in high losses, and were disadvantageous in the long run. The other two decks (i.e. C and D) gave lower rewards, but also lower losses, and resulted in a net gain in the long run. Subjects were instructed to win as much money as possible. They were also informed that some decks were better than others and that, in order to win, they had to avoid the disadvantageous decks and keep selecting cards from the advantageous decks. A global outcome score (net score) was calculated by subtracting the total number of cards selected from the disadvantageous decks (A +B) from the total number of cards selected from the advantageous decks (C+D). Selecting more cards from the bad decks results in an overall net loss across the 100 trials of the task, whereas choosing more cards from the advantageous decks results in overall net gains. In order to analyse learning within the different phases of the IGT, the 100 trials were grouped into five blocks of 20 consecutive cards (e.g. block 1 equals trials 1-20, block 2 equals trials 21-40 and so forth). Net scores were calculated for each of these five blocks.

#### Procedure

Residents were approached for participation by the staff members within the first 4 days of their arrival at the detoxification centre. Eligible participants provided written informed consent and were interviewed and tested within the first week from starting treatment (range 3–7 days). Baseline assessment had an average duration of 150 min and participants were allowed a brief break in between the different tests.

#### Short-term relapse

In order to determine short-term relapse status following treatment, each participant was contacted via telephone 3 months after the baseline assessment, or as close as possible to this target date. If the individual could not be reached directly, a significant other (such as a close family member) was contacted to serve as an alternative informant. Relapse was defined as any use of an illicit substance during the follow-up period, as measured by the IRAB. Abstinence at follow-up was defined as not having used any illicit drug during this period.

#### Data analysis

The sample was divided into two groups based on their relapse status at the 3-month follow-up interview: those who remained abstinent and those who relapsed during this period. Data for continuous variables were analysed using Student's t test or repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by post-hoc Bonferroni testing when the ANOVA revealed a

significant group effect. We used x tests for categorical data. A second set of analyses looked at the degree to which impulsivity predicted relapse. In order to constrain the number of independent variables within the regression analysis, only impulsivity variables on which abstinent and relapsed subjects differed at a p level of <0.10 in the bivariate analyses were entered into the multiple logistic regression models. In a final step, mediation analyses were performed to examine whether the effect of impulsivity on relapse was mediated by treatment retention. These analyses were restricted to the impulsivity variables that uniquely contributed to the prediction of relapse and were performed using Hayes' PROCESS macro for SPSS (2012) and following the criteria outlined by MacKinnon (2008). According to these authors, two conditions need to be met in order to test for mediation: there needs to be a significant effect from the predictor to the mediator (referred to as path a) and a significant effect from the mediator to the outcome (referred to as path b). All analyses were conducted using SPSS v. 22.0 (USA).

# Results

## Sample description

70 SDIs were included in the present analyses. Most participants (76%) reported cocaine use as their primary substance use problem, followed by opioids (10%), marijuana (9%) and amphetamines (5%), with multiple types of concurrent substance use being common. At 3 months following the baseline

assessment, 29 subjects (41%) were identified as abstainers, whereas 41 (59%) were classified as relapsers. Characteristics of the 70 SDIs, as a function of relapse status, are provided in Table 1. The abstinent and nonabstinent group did not differ with respect to any of the demographic, drug use or clinical variables measured at baseline.

### Impulsivity

#### Trait impulsivity

Table 2 displays UPPS impulsivity scores as a function of relapse status. Compared with abstainers, relapsers had significantly higher scores on the UPPS sensationseeking subscale (effect size = 0.25) and showed a trend toward higher urgency scores (effect size=0.22). Abstinent and relapsed participants did not differ significantly in their scores on the other UPPS dimensions.

#### Neurocognitive dimensions of impulsivity

Impulsive action. Data for the SST task were available for 26 out of 29 abstinent and 36 out of 41 relapsed participants. The probability of successful inhibition did not differ between the two groups (49% and 50%) and no participants were identified whose inhibition accuracy deviated 10% or more from the targeted 50%, suggesting that the staircase tracking algorithm was successfully applied to equalize response rates. The two groups did not differ in the time needed to inhibit pre-potent responses, as suggested by the absence of significant group differences in the SSRTs. No group difference was found in terms of the mean reaction time to go-signals and omission errors (Table 3).

Impulsive choice. On the DDT, delay discounting rates (k values) were estimated by non-linear regression using Mazur's hyperbolic model. An independent t test of transformed k values revealed that the relapsed

group showed significantly greater delay discounting than the individuals who remained abstinent during the follow-up period (effect size=0.29) (see Table 3).

On the IGT, there was a significant difference in the mean overall IGT net scores between the two groups, with abstainers achieving a higher average net score than relapsers (effect size=0.32) (see Table 3). A repeated-measures ANOVA with block (i.e. blocks 1 to 5) as the within-subject variable and group (i.e. abstainers and relapsers) as the between-subject variable revealed a significant block × group interaction (F4,268 = 2.50, p = 0.04). The main effect of block was only significant among abstainers (F4,108=3.93, p= 0.005). In contrast to the abstinent group, relapsers did not improve/change their performance as the task progressed (F4,160=2.04, p=0.09). Pairwise post-hoc analyses comparing both groups on each of the five blocks showed that abstainers chose more frequently from the advantageous decks on block 2, 4 and block 5 relative to relapsers (see Fig. 1).

#### Impulsivity and the prediction of post-treatment relapse

Impulsivity variables on which abstainers and relapsers differed (p<0.10) in the primary analyses were entered into a multivariate binary logistic regression analysis in order to ascertain their independent contribution to the prediction of relapse. In order to evaluate whether trait impulsivity (i.e. sensation seeking and urgency) would still explain unique variance in relapse once neurocognitive dimensions of impulsivity (i.e. delay discounting and decision-making) were taken into account, the analysis was performed in two blocks. In the first block, sensation seeking and urgency were entered. In the second block, delay discounting and decisionmaking were added while keeping sensation seeking and urgency in the model. Collinearity statistics for the predictor variables in the combined model yielded tolerance values between 0.92 and 0.99 and all variance inflation factor values were below 2, indicating that the validity of the regression model was not threatened by multicollinearity.

A test of the first model against a constant-only model was statistically significant, indicating that sensation seeking and urgency reliably distinguished between abstainers and relapsers (x2=8.83, p=0.012), with 16% of the (pseudo)variance in relapse explained. Inspection of the Wald criterion demonstrated that only sensation seeking contributed significantly to the prediction of relapse (see Table 4). A test of the second model (comprising sensation seeking, urgency, delay discounting and decision-making) against a constant-only model was also significant, suggesting that the four predictors as a set reliably distinguished between abstainers and relapsers (xa=20.92, p<0.001).

Fig. 1. Performance on the Iowa gambling task across blocks (1–5) as a function of group (abstainers versus relapsers). Each block (1-5) represents 20 sequential card selections. Significant group differences were found on blocks 2, 4 and 5. Values are means, with standard errors represented by vertical bars.

A combination of these four predictors was able to explain about 35% of the variance in relapse status. Adding delay discounting and decision-making to the first block improved the prediction model significantly (22 = 12.10, p = 0.002). The sensitivity and specificity of the second model in predicting relapse were 76% and 61%, respectively. Overall, the model correctly classified 70% of the sample. Inspection of the Wald criterion demonstrated that only delay discounting and decision-making contributed significantly to the prediction of relapse in the second model (see Table 4). As such, the effects of sensation seeking on relapse propensity were partialled out once these neurocognitive variables were entered into the regression model. Finally, a test of the second model (comprising sensation seeking, urgency, delay discounting and decision-making) against a model containing only the neurocognitive variables (i.e.

### Discussion

# Main findings

This study simultaneously examined the influence of multiple facets of impulsivity - covering both trait and neurocognitive dimensions - on post-treatment relapse in a heterogeneous sample of SDIs undergoing in-patient detoxification. In addition, we examined whether treatment retention served as a mediator of this relationship.

Compared with abstinent participants, those who relapsed showed a more pronounced devaluation of delayed rewards on the DDT and a tendency to make choices primarily guided by immediate prospects, rather than by long-term positive outcomes on the IGT. These findings are in keeping with a growing body of evidence indicating that delay discounting

and impulsive decision-making can substantially hamper the ability to achieve and maintain abstinence among various groups of drug users (Yoon et al. 2007; Passetti et al. 2008; MacKillop & Kahler, 2009; Washio et al. 2011; Sheffer et al. 2012). Abstinent and relapsed participants did not differ in their performance on a task measuring impulsive action. In line with recent suggestions that the mechanisms mediating addiction treatment outcomes differ from those involved in the aetiology of addiction (Garavan & Weierstall, 2012), it is possible that motor (dis)inhibition is implicated in the earlier (i.e. initiation of drug use) rather than in the latter stages of addiction (i.e. the ability to achieve/maintain abstinence). Consistent with this hypothesis, evidence from animal studies suggests that impulsive action primarily mediates the initial sensitivity to drugs, whereas impulsive choice is implicated in the persistence of drug-taking behaviour (Diergaarde et al. 2008; Broos et al. 2012).

Our study is among the first to investigate the unique contribution that different dimensions of impulsivity made in relation to short-term relapse propensity using multiple regressions and performing multicollinearity diagnostics. Results of the multiple regression analyses showed that delay discounting and impulsive decision-making represented independent predictors of relapse propensity, with the DDT and IGT each tapping unique variance in relapse. Although our data suggest that the joint use of both trait and neurocognitive measures of impulsivity may have incremental predictive power over the use of either type of measure alone, some preliminary evidence also indicates that neurocognitive tasks of impulsive choice may outperform trait measures of impulsivity in predicting short-term relapse propensity. Specifically, the effects of sensation seeking on relapse were partialled out once the contribution of delay discounting and decision-making was taken into account. Accordingly, sensation seeking did not contribute significant unique variance to the prediction of relapse beyond that accounted for by delay discounting and impulsive decision-making. From a theoretical perspective, these data suggest that short-term relapse is primarily influenced by transitory behavioural states, which fluctuate in response to environmental influences. This dynamic and state-dependent interplay may be better captured by neurocognitive tasks in particular those that involve motivational/affective components (see also Wiers et al. 2010). Self-report questionnaires, by contrast, assess general behavioural tendencies, and, accordingly, may be less sensitive in predicting specific behaviours in a particular moment or at a particular state (Wiers et al. 2010). Similarly, neurocognitive tasks that do not include motivationally relevant stimuli (i.e. neutral SST) may be less sensitive in predicting short-term relapse, potentially because they 'decontextualize' the affective nature of inhibitory impairments in SDIs. From a clinical perspective, these data indicate that - whilst many drug users may have an impulsive personality - abstinence-oriented interventions might most productively focus on abnormalities in objectively measurable cognitive and motivational processes (Powell et al. 2010).

Consistent with the well-established relationship between impulsivity and shorter treatment retention on the one hand (Verdejo-García et al. 2012; Stevens et al. 2013, 2014), and shorter treatment retention and relapse propensity on the other hand (Zhang et al. 2003), the effects of impulsivity on relapse were mediated by treatment retention: once the effects of treatment retention were taken into account, the direct effect of delay discounting and impulsive decisionmaking on relapse propensity became non-significant. Results of the current study suggest that drug users with elevated levels of impulsive choice tend to have shorter treatment stays, which in turn places them at increased risk for relapse tollowing treatment discharge. Future studies examining the effects of impulsivity on relapse should therefore explicitly take into account this indirect pathway by which impulsivity may influence post-treatment outcomes.

### Clinical implications

Neurocognitive assessment of impulsive choice early during treatment may offer a cost-effective way to identify relapse-prone drug users, such that these subjects may subsequently receive additional monitoring. Second, results indicate that post-treatment relapse in drug users can be reduced by interventions that target the cognitive/affective processes involved in delay discounting and impulsive decision-making or by those that improve treatment retention in drug users who tend to make impulsive choices on these indices.

To date, several interventions have proven to be successful in reducing delay discounting and impulsive decision-making in SDIs. Consistent with the notion that adaptive decision-making partially depends on the integrity of the dorsolateral prefrontal loop and the executive system (Brand et al. 2006), cognitive working memory training causes significant reductions in the preference for small immediate rewards over delayed rewards in SDIs (Bickel et al. 2011). Disadvantageous decision-making has also been linked to abnormalities in the processing of emotional signals that normally work to anticipate the prospective outcomes of potential decisions (e.g. Bechara et al. 1997; Weller et al. 2007). In this regard, interventions aimed at

enhancing interoceptive awareness or negative emotions linked to risky decisions may partially normalize decision-making performance (Fernández-Serrano et al. 2011). Hypothetically, a combination of both top-down and bottom-up interventions may be most fruitful in targeting impulsive decision-making (Alfonso et al. 2011). With respect to pharmacological options, a recent study demonstrated beneficial effects of a single dose of modafinil on delay discounting in alcohol-dependent patients (Schmaal et al. 2014). These beneficial effects were accompanied by enhanced prefrontal control over ventral striatal reward processing (Schmaal et al. 2014). However, studies examining to what extent treatment-induced improvements in cognitive functioning are directly related to changes in clinically relevant outcomes (e.g. abstinence) are needed.

Whereas the aforementioned interventions may have the potential to improve delay discounting, impulsive decision-making and, speculatively, short-term treatment outcomes, our findings also suggest that drug users with high levels of impulsive choice may drop out of treatment before any of these cognitive-motivational impairments can be adequately addressed. Therefore, introducing elements that more directly affect retention rates early during treatment may be a priority in attempts to improve post-treatment outcomes for high-impulsive drug users. One promising strategy to improve treatment retention in drug users may be to offer motivational incentives contingent on consecutive attendance (Higgins et al. 2000; García-Rodríguez et al. 2009). Longer treatment retention may in turn enable the implementation of more specialized, cognitive-motivational rehabilitation interventions later on during treatment.

## Limitations

The current findings should be considered in light of the study's weaknesses. First, we used a relatively loose definition of relapse and relied solely on selfreported abstinence. Future investigations of relapse may benefit from incorporating more objective, biological measures, e.g. hair analyses, to verify abstinence. Whereas the naturalistic sampling approach of the current study increases the generalizability of our findings, it should be noted that our study was conducted in a relatively severe population of drug users, as indicated by high levels of psychiatric co-morbidity, neurocognitive impairment, trait impulsivity and relatively extensive histories of drug use. As such, caution should be taken when transferring the presented findings to less severe (e.g. out-patient) treatment samples. Finally, our samples were relatively small, and subtle differences in impulsivity between the abstinent and relapsed groups may not have been detected

## A B S T R A C T

Background: Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the US, and rates of suicide are higher in rural than urban areas. As proposed by the Interpersonal-Psychological Theory of Suicide, thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness are risk factors for suicidal behavior, although protective individual-level characteristics such as forgiveness, may indirectly affect suicidal behavior by decreasing the deleterious effect of thwarted interpersonal needs.

Method: A sample of uninsured adults recruited from a rural primary clinic (N=101) completed the Brief Multidimensional Measure of Religiousness and Spirituality; Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised; Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire; and Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, Parallel and serial multivariable mediation analyses were conducted to test for direct and indirect effects of forgiveness on suicidal behavior.

Results: In parallel mediation, covarying depressive symptoms, forgiveness of self had an indirect effect on suicidal behavior, through perceived burdensomeness. Inclusion of depressive symptoms as a mediator revealed an indirect effect of forgiveness of self and others on suicidal behavior via depression, thwarted belongingness, and perceived burdensomeness in a serial mediation model. Limitation: A longitudinal study, with an equal representation of males and diverse populations is

needed to replicate our findings. Discussion: Our findings have implications for the role health providers can play in addressing suicide

with rural patients. Promoting forgiveness, may, in turn affect interpersonal functioning and decrease risk for suicidal behavior.

## 1. Introduction

Suicide is a significant public health concern worldwide (Beautrais and Mishara, 2008); in United States, suicide ranks as the 10th leading cause of death, and over 38,000 individuals die by suicide annually (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 2011). Thus, the discovery and investigation of risk and protective factors for suicidal behavior is essential for effective prevention, and primary health care settings may be an ideal ""catchment"" site to conduct such studies. That is, the majority of Americans receiving mental health care do so from their primary care physician (Ray-Sannerud et al., 2012) and, among adults, approximately 50% of people who die by suicide are in contact with their primary care physician in the month prior to death (Luoma et al., 2002).

Use of primary care settings as a site for early detection and prevention of suicidal behavior may be important in rural areas,

where there are higher rates of suicide (17.9/100,000) than in urban areas (14.9/100,000; Hirsch, 2006; Nock and Kessler, 2006), perhaps as a result of rural socio-cultural and socioeconomic economic factors that limit utilization of mental health care (Hirsch, 2006; Kim et al., 2011). These factors may include increased poverty, low education, stigma toward mental illness, reluctance to seek help, belief systems promoting ""rugged individualism,"" firearm and pesticide familiarity, and cost of and access to mental health services.

In addition to rurality, demographic characteristics such as age, and inter- and intra-personal factors, such as depressive symptoms and interpersonal relationships, may contribute to risk (Van Orden et al., 2008). Of note, current epidemiological research suggests that middle-age adults have greater rates of suicide than in previous decades (Karch et al., 2011), including among individuals in the age groups of 35-44 (15.1/100,000 population), 45–54 (18.9/100,000 population), and 55–64 (15.9/100,000 population). These rates are higher than the national suicide rate of 11.8/100,000 individuals (Centers for Disease Control, 2011).

Because age and many other demographic characteristics are unalterable, it is important to identify potentially modifiable factors associated with suicidal behavior, such as interpersonal functioning and spirituality. According to the Interpersonal-Psychological Theory of Suicide (IPTS; Joiner, 2005; Joiner et al., 2009; Van Orden et al., 2010), thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness increase desire for suicide. Thwarted belongingness is the feeling that one is not socially connected nor integrated into valued relationships (Joiner, 2005), and refers to an unmet need to belong (Van Orden et al., 2012), or an absence of reciprocal caring relationships (Van Orden et al., 2010). This construct is similar to other known predictors of suicide such as feelings of loneliness and social isolation, and lack of social integration (Duberstein et al., 2004; Van Orden et al., 2012); conversely, when an individual's need to belong is satisfied, suicide risk is mitigated (Gordon et al., 2011).

Perceived burdensomeness is the sense that one ineffectively contributes to the welfare of others in their social network (Joiner, 2005), and develops when the need for social competence, or the desire to be effective in one's social group, is unmet. Affectivelyladen cognitions of self-blame, shame, and self-hatred, and beliefs that one is flawed or a liability to others, may lead an individual to believe their death would be a relief to others (Van Orden et al., 2010). Such thoughts and emotions may be triggered by family conflict, unemployment, physical illness or disability, and homelessness (Van Orden et al., 2010), among other negative life events, and may elevate risk for suicide (Motto and Bostrom, 1990), whereas low levels of perceived burdensomeness decrease suicide risk (Gordon et al., 2011). An interaction between perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness may contribute to increased risk for suicidal behavior (Van Orden et al., 2008), and perceived burdensomeness may be a more robust contributor to suicidal behavior than thwarted belongingness, perhaps because it diminishes motivation associated with selfpreservation (Joiner et al., 2009). Further, risk is exacerbated when, in addition to the presence of thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness, individuals acquire the capability for suicide (Joiner, 2005; Van Orden et al., 2012).

Despite the growing support for the ITPS theory of suicide risk (Tomassini et al., 2003), few studies have examined potential mechanistic individual-level characteristics, such as forgiveness, that may decrease suicide risk by decreasing perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness. Although religiousness and spirituality are commonly associated with less suicidal behavior (Koenig et al., 2012), such findings are broad and do not identify specific beneficial aspects of religiousness and spirituality. Forgiveness, which is common but not unique to all mainstream world religions (Webb et al., 2012), consists of an internalized process of motivation and volition whereby there is a reduction in negative emotional, cognitive, and behavioral responses to an offender or offense (Toussaint and Webb, 2005; Worthington et al., 2001). Targets of forgiveness can include, but are not limited to, the self, others, or from God (Toussaint and Webb, 2005). The practice of forgiveness is associated with better physical and mental health (Webb et al., 2012, in press), and with reduced risk for suicidal behavior (Hirsch et al., 2011).

Self-forgiveness may include forgiveness for interpersonal transgressions, which involve forgiving oneself for offending another person, or intrapersonal transgressions, which involve forgiving oneself for offending the self (Hall and Fincham, 2005). Lack of self-forgiveness may be indicative of an intrapunitive dispositional style, whereby the individual internalizes blame and feels ""unworthy of acceptance"" (Ross et al., 2007, p. 159). On the other hand, failure to forgive others may be indicative of an extrapunitive dispositional style, whereby an individual externalizes blame, and experiences anger or holds grudges (Rye et al., 2004).

Finally, feeling forgiven by a God is the perception that one's shortcomings have been alleviated or accepted as reasonable by the divine (Toussaint et al., 2008a). Divine forgiveness may heal interpersonal and intrapersonal wounds, facilitate social interactions, and may lead to possible psychological benefits such as reduced guilt and feelings of unworthiness, decreased depressive, anxiety and somatic symptoms, and increased life satisfaction (Krause and Ellison, 2003; Toussaint et al., 2001; Webb et al., 2012).

Forgiveness, overall, may have both a direct and indirect effect on psychological well-being and interpersonal functioning (Huichi and Ming-xia, 2011; Worthington et al., 2001). Its direct effect on suicidal behavior may be via the resolution of negative emotions such as anger, hostility, and fear (Hirsch et al., 2011; Webb et al., 2011). An indirect effect of forgiveness on suicidal behavior may operate through mediating variables such as mental health, social support, and interpersonal functioning (Hirsch et al., 2011; Webb et al., 2011; Worthington et al., 2001). Alternatively, difficulty forgiving may promote negative affect about ones' self or perceived imperfections, and may interfere with maintenance of affiliation and emotional bonds, perhaps affecting burdensomeness and belongingness (Worthington et al., 2001; Worthington and Scherer, 2004).

Although some evidence exists linking forgiveness to suicidal behavior (Hirsch et al., 2011, 2012), ours is the first study to examine such relationships in a rural, primary care sample. Importantly, rural factors such as low population density may increase isolation, loneliness (Hirsch, 2006; Stark et al., 2011), and the likelihood for thwarted belongingness. Greater levels of economic crisis and financial loss in rural areas (Hirsch, 2006; Turvey et al., 2002), may increase the likelihood for perceived burdensomeness.

We conducted a series of statistical mediation analyses. including parallel and serial multivariable mediation models. In a parallel model, we examined mechanisms by which forgiveness may affect suicidal behavior, through thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness. We hypothesized that (i) forgiveness would be negatively associated with suicidal behavior, thwarted belongingness, and perceived burdensomeness; (ii) thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness would be positively associated with suicidal behavior; and (iii) thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness would mediate the relationship between forgiveness (of self, of others, and feeling forgiven by God) and suicidal behavior, such that greater forgiveness would be associated with less thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness which, in turn, would be related to less suicidal behavior.

Utilizing a serial mediation model, we assessed depressive symptoms, thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness as a series of potential mediators (Hirsch et al., 2011). Depression, a well-established suicide risk factor (Lake, 2008), may affect interpersonal functioning and satisfaction of interpersonal needs (Joiner, 1995); indeed, in a study of suicide notes, interpersonal difficulties were reported more frequently in notes from depressed versus non-depressed writers (O'Connor et al., 1999). It is possible that the negative cognitive shift commonly associated with depressogenic thinking may contribute to negative feedback-seeking behavior and consequent social rejection, as well as to negative cognitions about personal effectiveness in social and vocational endeavors (Adler et al., 2006; Beck and Weishaar, 2008; Furukawa et al., 2011; Joiner et al., 2009; Stellrecht et al., 2006). Yet, forgiveness may reduce the effect of depression on these variables; thus, our serial model included depressive symptoms as a first order mediator, thwarted belongingness as the second order mediator, and perceived burdensomeness as the third order mediator. It was hypothesized that forgiveness would indirectly mitigate risk for suicidal behavior; specifically, in serial fashion, greater forgiveness would be associated with lower levels of (i.e., each, in turn) depressive symptoms, thwarted belongingness, and perceived burdensomeness which, in turn, would be related to less suicidal behavior.

## 2. Methods

## 2.1. Participants

Participants (n=101) in this IRB-approved study were recruited from a rural, primary care clinic serving working uninsured patients, in a region of the United States identified as a Health Provider Shortage Area (HPSA; Correll et al., 2011). Importantly, mental health disorders are more prevalent, and rates of suicide are greater, among uninsured individuals than insured individuals (Tondo et al., 2006). Participants were primarily female (n=71; 71%), White (n=94; 94%), and had a mean age of 42.18 (SD=12.83) (see Table 1). Our sample ranged from 18 to 64 years of age, and did not qualify for state-level insurance (Tenncare) or federal-level insurance (Medicare). Participants completed an informed consent process, and received \$15.00 for completion of survey materials.

## 2.2. Measures

Demographic characteristics were assessed, including age, sex, race and ethnicity, education level, income, employment status, marital status, number of children, and religious practice.

Forgiveness was assessed using items from the Brief Multidimensional Measure of Religiousness and Spirituality (BMMRS) (Fetzer Institute, 2003). Three single-item measures of forgiveness were used: forgiveness of self (""I have forgiven myself for things that I have done wrong""); forgiveness of others (""I have forgiven those who hurt me""); and, feeling forgiven by God (""I know that God forgives me""). Items were answered on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (always or almost always) to 4 (never). Items were reverse scored, and higher scores represent greater forgiveness. A total score of these three forgiveness items has shown fair internal and test-retest reliability (α=.68; ICC > .70; Harris et al., 2008). Consistent with previous work (Webb et al., 2011), we used individual items in the current study; however, when summed, Cronbach's & for the three items =.66. Participants also completed single-item measures from the BMMRS assessing spirituality and religiousness, which were covaried.

Suicidal behavior was assessed with the Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised (SBQ-R), a 4-item measure of suicidal thoughts and behavior (Linehan and Nielsen, 1981; Osman et al., 2001). Total score comprises: suicidal ideation and attempts (""Have you ever thought about or attempted to kill yourself""); suicide ideation in the past year (""How often have you thought about killing yourself in the past year""); communication of intent (""Have you ever told someone that you were going to commit suicide, or that you might do it""); and likelihood of future attempts (""How likely is that you will attempt suicide someday""). ltems are scored on a Likert scale; higher scores represent greater suicidal behavior. The SBQ-R has acceptable (α=.76) to good (x=.88) reliability (Osman et al., 2001); in the current sample, Cronbach's α=. 74.

The Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire (INQ), an 18-item self-report measure, was utilized to assess thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness, on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (not at all true for me) to 7 (very true for me) (Joiner et al., 2009). Higher scores represent greater thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness. Both thwarted belongingness (e.g., ""These days I often feel like an outsider in social gatherings"") and perceived burdensomeness (e.g., ""These days the people in my life would be better off if I were gone"") subscales contain nine items. Previous research on adults, using an earlier version of the INQ (Van Orden et al., 2008), indicated internal consistency for thwarted belongingness (Cronbach's «=.85) and perceived burdensomeness (α=.89) as good. In a second study, using the 18-item INQ, Cronbach's alphas of .91 and .75 were obtained for thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness, respectively (Marty et al., 2012). In the current sample, Cronbach's x for thwarted belongingness =. 93, and for perceived burdensomeness =. 91.

The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D-R 20), a 20-item scale, was used to assess presence and severity of depressive symptoms (Radloff, 1977). Items are rated on a 4-point Likert score ranging from zero (rarely or none of the time) to three (most or all of the time). Higher scores represent greater depressive symptoms. The CES-D-R 20 has good internal reliability (α=.85; Roberts, 1980), and has been used successfully in primary care research (Uebelacker et al., 2009); current Cronbach's alpha =.93.

### 2.3. Statistical analyses

Bivariate analyses. Pearson's product-moment correlations were used to examine zero-order associations between forgiveness (of self, of others, by God), thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness, depressive symptoms and suicidal behavior, as well as independence among study variables.

Correlations between variables did not exceed the recommended cut-off for multicollinearity (r > .80) (Katz, 2006).

Parallel multivariable mediation analyses. Parallel multivariable mediation analyses were conducted (Preacher and Hayes, 2008a), which allow for one independent variable (IV), one dependent variable (DV), and more than one simultaneous mediator variable (MV). Since only one IV per model is allowed, separate forgiveness-based models were constructed to assess pathways through which forgiveness of self, of others, and by God (IVs) influence suicidal behavior (DV); the particular forgiveness dimensions not employed as the single IV were covaried (Preacher and Hayes, 2008a), as were age, sex, ethnicity, religiousness, spirituality, and depressive symptoms.

Preacher and Hayes' (2008a) mediation techniques use bootstrap resampling to calculate indirect effects (Preacher and Hayes, 2008b), can be used with non-normally distributed data, and allow for indirect effects without the presence of direct effects. As illustrated (Fig. 1), a total effect (c) refers to the relationship between IV and DV without controlling for MVs. A direct effect (c' ) refers to the relationship between IV and DV after controlling for MVs. A total indirect effect (ab) refers to the role of all MVs in the relationship between IV and DV. A specific indirect effect (a1b1 and/ or a2b2) refers to the role of a particular MV in the relationship between IV and DV. Mediation analyses can produce five different results: (i) total effect (c); (ii) direct effect (c'); (iii) indirect only effect, whereby ab is significant, but c and c' are not significant; (iv) partial mediation, whereby there is a decrease from c to c' and c' remains significant, and (v) full mediation, whereby there is a decrease from c to c' and c' falls out of significance (Preacher and Hayes, 2004).

Serial multivariable mediation analyses. We conducted a serial multiple mediation model (Hayes, 2012), with depression, thwarted belongingness, and perceived burdensomeness as mediators. In serial mediation, mediators are assumed to have a direct effect on each other (Hayes, 2012), and the independent variable (forgiveness) is assumed to influence mediators in a serial fashion which then, subsequently, influence the dependent variable (suicidal behavior). In addition to possible results that can be expected from a parallel multiple mediator model, as described earlier, a multiple serial mediator model with three mediators (depression, thwarted belongingness, and perceived burdensomeness) can provide seven specific indirect effects (see Fig. 2). The specific indirect effects are (1) through depression (a1b1); (2) through depression and thwarted belongingness (a1a4b2); (3) through depression and perceived burdensomeness

## 3. Results

In bivariate analyses, there was partial support for Hypotheses i and ii (see Table 2); forgiveness of self (r= -. 28, p=.004) and of others (r= - . 24, p =. 017), but not forgiveness by God, were significantly negatively associated with suicidal behavior. Thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness were significantly negatively associated with forgiveness of self (r = - . 58, and - . 55, ps <. 001, respectively), of others (r = - . 43, p <. 001, and r = . 31, p =. 002, respectively), and by God (r = -. 24, p =. 015, and r = -. 22, p =. 027, respectively). Thwarted belongingness (r=.44) and perceived burdensomeness (r=.49) were also significantly positively associated with suicidal behavior (ps < . 001). Depressive symptoms were significantly, positively associated with thwarted belongingness (r=.75, p < .001), perceived burdensomeness (r=.64, p <.001), and negatively associated with forgiveness of self (r = - . 48, p < . 001), others (r = - . 23, p =. 02), and by God (r = - . 24, p =. 02).

There was partial support for our parallel mediation hypothesis. Significant total and direct effects for all forgiveness dimensions on suicidal behavior were not observed (see Table 3); however, in mediation analyses, total effects and/or direct effects are not required for indirect effects to be present (Hayes, 2012). The total indirect effect of self-forgiveness on suicidal behavior

was statistically significant, as the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the point estimate did not cross zero (ab= - 38, Cl= - 1.05 to -. 07). Examination for specific indirect effects revealed that perceived burdensomeness was a mediator (a2b2= -. 41, Cl= - 1.07 to -. 10), but thwarted belongingness was not (q1b1; Cl crosses zero). Only greater self-forgiveness was associated with lower levels of perceived burdensomeness (a2= -. 51, p=. 003) which, in turn, was associated with lower levels of suicidal behavior (b2=.81, p=.008); no significant mediation-based effects were found for forgiveness of others or by God.

In serial mediation analyses (see Table 4), there were no significant total (c) or direct effects (c') of any forgiveness dimension on suicidal behavior. The total indirect effects (a1b1+a1a4b2+a1a5b3+a1a4a6b3+a202+a2a6b3+a3b3) of forgiveness of self and forgiveness of others on suicidal behavior were statistically significant, as the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the point estimate did not cross zero. A total indirect effect in the context of forgiveness by God was not found.

Significant specific indirect effects were also found, for each type of forgiveness (see Table 4). First, there was a significant indirect pathway for forgiveness of self (a1b1= –. 61, CI= – 1.28 to -. 14) and forgiveness of others (a1b1= -. 29, CI= -. 88 to -. 03) through depressive symptoms. Greater forgiveness of self and others were associated with fewer depressive symptoms which, in turn, were associated with less suicidal behavior. Second, there was a significant indirect pathway for forgiveness of self (a10403= -. 18, CI= -. 44 to -. 05) and forgiveness of others (a104663= - . 11, Cl=-. 35 to -. 01), through depressive symptoms, thwarted belongingness, and perceived burdensomeness. Greater forgiveness of self and others were serially associated with (i.e., each in turn) lower levels of depression, thwarted belongingness, and perceived burdensomeness which, in turn,

were related to less suicidal behavior. Finally, there was a significant indirect pathway for forgiveness of self (a206b3= - . 16, Cl=-. 40 to -. 04) and forgiveness of others (a2acb3 =-. 20, CI= - . 48 to -. 05), through thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness. Greater forgiveness of self and others were serially associated with less thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness which, in turn, were associated with lower levels of suicidal behavior. As with forgiveness of self and forgiveness of others, greater forgiveness by God was associated with fewer depressive symptoms which, in turn, were related to less suicidal behavior (a1b1= - . 36, Cl= - 1.20 to -. 003).

Interestingly, there were no significant indirect effects between forgiveness of self, others, and by God and suicidal behavior, serially through (i) depressive symptoms and thwarted belongingness; (ii) depressive symptoms and perceived burdensomeness; (iii) thwarted belongingness; and, (iv) perceived burdensomeness. Additionally, no indirect effect was found for the association of forgiveness by God and suicidal behavior, through (i) through depressive symptoms, thwarted belongingness, and perceived burdensomeness; and (ii) through thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness.

## 4. Discussion

Overall, our findings extend research indicating the positive impact of forgiveness on mental health and interpersonal functioning (Fisher and Exline, 2006; Toussaint et al., 2001; Webb et al., 2012). In bivariate analyses, our hypotheses were supported: forgiveness of self, of others, and by God was negatively associated with thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness. Consistent with previous research, forgiveness of self and of others was significantly negatively associated with suicidal behavior (Hirsch et al., 2011); forgiveness by God was not. Thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness were significantly positively associated with suicidal behavior, in support of the Interpersonal Psychological Theory of Suicide (Cox et al., 2011; Davidson et al., 2011).

## 4.1. Mediation analyses

Our study is one of only a few that has examined a mechanism through which forgiveness affects health outcomes (e.g., Hirsch et al., 2011, 2012; Webb et al., 2011, in press), finding that forgiveness of self and of others exert an influence on suicidal behavior through indirect processes. Further, our results are consistent with the hypothesis of Stellrecht et al. (2006) that depression may adversely affect interpersonal processes, thwarting the interpersonal need of belongingness and contributing to sense of burdensomeness.

#### 4.2. Parallel mediation

In parallel mediation analyses, none of the forgiveness dimensions had a direct effect on suicidal behavior, which is inconsistent with a previous study utilizing an urban, multicultural sample, where forgiveness of others was directly associated (Hirsch et al., 2011). Such mixed findings imply, perhaps, that the effects of forgiveness may differ by ethnicity or across the rural-urban continuum, suggesting potential socio-cultural differences in the role of forgiveness (Sandage and Williamson, 2005).

We found that self-forgiveness is associated with less risk of suicidal behavior, over and above the effects of depressive symptoms, through its ameliorative influence on perceived burdensomeness. Thwarted belongingness was not a significant mediator of the relationship between forgiveness and suicidal behavior. Our findings support the assertion of IPTS, that perceived burdensomeness, with its negative cognitions of selfhatred and beliefs that one is flawed, may be a more robust risk factor for suicidal behavior than thwarted belongingness (Van Orden et al., 2006, 2010). Self-forgiveness may be conceptualized as a meaning-focused coping strategy, whereby an individual is able to modify an appraisal of the burden they put on their social networks or re-evaluate their perceived role in interpersonal relationships (Jacinto and Edwards, 2011). In addition, selfforgiveness may be associated with fewer such self-condemning thoughts and beliefs, thereby reducing suicide risk. The positive cognitive, emotional and behavioral shift that is achieved through forgiveness may allow an individual to feel less of a burden to their social network (Tangney et al., 2005).

#### 4.3. Serial mediation

In serial mediation analyses, greater levels of forgiveness of self and of others were associated with less suicidal behavior through three mechanisms: (i) indirectly via fewer depressive symptoms; (ii) via lower levels of depressive symptoms and, then, serially, through lower levels of thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness; and, (iii) via lower levels of thwarted belongingness, and then less perceived burdensomeness. Additionally, forgiveness by God was indirectly associated with less suicidal behavior via lower levels of depressive symptoms. The effect of forgiveness of self, of others, and by God on suicidal behavior, through depression, is consistent with previous research (Hirsch et al., 2011); further, our serial pattern of results highlight the potential role of the intra-individual characteristics of forgiveness and depressive symptoms on interpersonal processes of suicidal behavior (Joiner, 1995; Joiner et al., 2009). Also of note, our lack of findings when only thwarted belongingness or perceived burdensomeness were included, alone, in a model, suggests that the cumulative effect of both of these factors contributes particular risk (Van Orden et al., 2008).

Overall, those with a greater tendency to forgive, or to feel forgiven, are less likely to report depressive symptoms (Strelan and Covic, 2006) and, in turn, to have fewer perceptions of failed belongingness and social liability, and less risk for suicidal behavior. Self-forgiveness may allow an individual to curtail the excessive and negative feedback-seeking and reassurance-seeking behaviors of those with depression, which also adversely affect the satisfaction of interpersonal needs (Joiner, 1995; Stellrecht et al., 2006). Self-forgiveness may also allow an individual to challenge the self-punitive thoughts and emotions that often accompany depression (Thompson et al., 2005; Toussaint et al., 2008b); in turn, resolution of depressive symptoms may contribute to improved social relationships and sense of social effectiveness, resulting in decreased suicide risk.

Depressive symptoms and suicidal behavior are often triggered by interpersonal disruptions, real or perceived (Tse and Yip, 2009; Van Orden et al., 2005); as such, forgiveness of others may decrease risk for such outcomes by assuaging negative perceptions and emotions about perceived interpersonal difficulties and promoting positive social behavioral exchanges (Tse and Yip, 2009). Cognitively, greater other-forgiveness may enhance emotion regulation by contributing to positive cognitive processing and decreased attention bias toward negative information, which may result in fewer depressive symptoms (Marroquín, 2011). In turn, resolution of depressive symptoms may contribute to a reduced perception of poor social functioning and burdensomeness, thereby ameliorating suicide risk (Stellrecht et al., 2006).

## 4.4. Limitations

Our novel findings must be understood in the context of limitations. Our cross-sectional design precludes exploration of causal inferences, and bi-directionality is a possibility. For ınstance, individuals who are depressed, or who have a sense of burdensomeness or an unmet need for social relationships, may be less able to forgive themselves or others; however, our hypotheses were based on theory and previous research suggesting that forgiveness may indirectly affect poor mental health outcomes via effects on interpersonal relationships and mental health functioning (Hirsch et al., 2011; Webb et al., 2011; Worthington et al., 2001). Our small sample was largely female and White; thus, prospective and longitudinal research, in larger and more diverse clinical samples, is needed to confirm our findings. In addition, our use of single-item measures of forgiveness is not ideal; future investigations should utilize more comprehensive measures of forgiveness.

## 4.5. Implications

Our findings may have important implications for suicide prevention efforts. Forgiveness of self, of others and, by God, are associated with better interpersonal functioning and, therefore, reduced suicide risk, suggesting their utility as intervention targets. Previous research links forgiveness to reduced depressive symptoms and suicidal behavior (Hirsch et al., 2011; Tse and Yip, 2009), and interventions designed to bolster forgiveness are associated with decreased depressive symptoms, and greater self-esteem and positive emotions (Baskin and Enright, 2004; Strelan and Covic, 2006). Forgiveness-based interventions may also be effective in the treatment of suicidal individuals. As examples, the Interpersonal Process Model of Forgiveness, which emphasizes cognitivereframing and perspective-taking to facilitate forgiveness of others (Enright, 2001), or the REACH model of forgiveness (R=recall, E=empathize, A=altruistic gift of forgiveness, C=commitment to publicly forgive, H=holding on to forgiveness), which focuses on development of empathy to foster both other-forgiveness and selfforgiveness (Worthington, 2006a, 2006b), are associated with beneficial health outcomes (Worthington, 2006a; Worthington et al., 2000), and may be models for the development of a suicide-focused intervention.

Our study is the first to highlight potential mechanistic explanations for the effects of forgiveness on mental health outcomes, via satisfaction of interpersonal needs. Future research on the interrelationships between these risk and protective factors for suicide is needed; however, health care providers in primary care settings may find benefit from assessment and promotion of their patients' intra- and interpersonal functioning, including forgiveness, sense of self-efficacy, and social support, in their efforts to ameliorate mental health difficulties and prevent suicide.

Keywords: Trauma Depression Risk behavior War Adolescents

## A B S T R A C T

Background: The relationship between war-related trauma exposure, depressive symptoms and multiple risk behaviors among adolescents is less clear in sub-Saharan Africa.

Methods: We analyzed data collected from a sample of school-going adolescents four years postwar. Participants completed interviews assessing various risk behaviors defined by the Youth Self Report (YSR) and a sexual risk behavior survey, and were screened for post-traumatic stress, anxiety and depression symptoms based on the Impact of Events Scale Revised (IESR) and Hopkins Symptom Checklist for Adolescents (HSCL-37A) respectively. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess factors independently associated with multiple risk behaviors. The logistic regression model of Baron and Kenny (1986) was used to evaluate the mediating role of depression in the relationship between stressful war events and multiple risk behaviors.

Results: Of 551 participants, 139 (25%) reported multiple (three or more) risk behaviors in the past year. In the multivariate analyses, depression symptoms remained with multiple risk behavior after adjusting for potential confounders including socio-demographic characteristics, war-related trauma exposure variables, anxiety and post-traumatic stress symptoms. In mediation analysis, depression symptoms mediated the associations between stressful war events and multiple risk behaviors.

Limitations: The psychometric properties of the questionnaires used in this study are not well established in war affected African samples thus ethno cultural variation may decrease the validity of our measures.

Conclusions: Adolescents with depression may be at a greater risk of increased engagement in multiple risk behaviors. Culturally sensitive and integrated interventions to treat and prevent depression among adolescents in post-conflict settings are urgently needed.

## 1. Introduction

Most studies of post-war adolescents have focused on estimating prevalence rates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety symptoms (Amone-P'olak et al., 2007; Bayer et al., 2007; Klasen et al., 2010). More recently, researchers have started to investigate the association between war exposure and risk behaviors such as aggression, suicidality, and substance abuse and how these behaviors relate to intrafamilial adversity

and war-related experiences (Klasen et al., 2010; Kolltveit et al., 2012; Panter-Brick et al., 2011; Schiff et al., 2012). For example, cross-sectional studies in Ugandan former child soldiers found a high rate of aggression (Weierstall et al., 2012; Klasen et al., 2010), with increased rates for those exposed to both war and intrafamilial violence (Klasen et al., 2010). Similarly, a study among Isreali adolescents found exposure to recurrent threats was associated with high rates of self-reported aggression (Pat-Horenczyk et al., 2007). Other studies have documented substance abuse and risk-taking behaviors following exposure to war (Franic et al., 2011; Schiff et al., 2012).

An increased likelihood of exposure to intrafamilial adversity in longstanding conflicts such as in Uganda and Afghanistan suggests that some children may be exposed to a high cumulative burden of

risk for exposure that appears to influence risk behavior (Catani et al., 2009; Klasen et al., 2010). It has been hypothesized that the association between war exposure and externalizing behaviors may occur through a direct causal link, indirectly through comorbidity with internalizing problems e.g., PTSD, depression, or may be due to third variables associated with both. Of these three possibilities, the indirect effect has received the most attention in the literature. Increased rates of internalizing symptoms are considered one of the mechanisms through which elevated externalizing behaviors are explained (Schiff et al., 2007).

A growing body of literature has also shown that adolescents who develop PTSD following exposure to trauma are more likely to participate in risk behaviors such as alcohol and substance use, suicidal behavior and aggression (Schiff et al., 2007, 2012; Bayer et al., 2007; Klasen et al., 2010; Pat-Horenczyk et al., 2007). However, research on depression as a risk factor for engagement in risk behaviors in the general and war affected populations is limited (Acierno et al., 2000; Brown et al., 2009; Carr et al., 2013;Lundberg et al., 2011). Two studies have reported that depression plays a more important role in engaging in risk behavior than PTSD (Acierno et al., 2000; Carr et al., 2013) while another study has shown that risk behaviors are particularly common among adolescents experiencing co-occurring depression and PTSD (Schiff et al., 2007). These studies neither report on the relationship between war-related stressors and risk behavior nor do they report on the potential mediating role of depression in this relationship.

Studies on gender differences in risk behavior among adolescents have yielded mixed results. Although, most studies report that boys have higher levels of risk behaviors (Amone-P'olak et al., 2007; Pat-Horenczyk et al., 2007; Qouta et al., 2008; Sibai et al., 2009), some studies have found the opposite pattern (Young, 2010) or no gender differences (Chemtob et al., 2011; Franic et al., 2011). There is limited information on gender differences in multiple risk behaviors in postconflict settings in sub-Saharan Africa.

Therefore, to better understand the relationship between war exposure and risk behaviors, in this paper we examine gender differences in socio-demographics, mental health symptoms and risk behaviors among school-going adolescents in post-conflict northern Uganda. Further, we investigate factors independently associated with multiple risk behaviors and explore the mediating role of depression symptoms in the association between war exposure and multiple risk behaviors.

# 2. Method

#### 2.1. Study setting and population

Study participants were school-going adolescents recruited from seven out of fourteen government and private-operated secondary schools in Gulu district situated in Northern Uganda. Prior to 2006 the district had experienced over 20 years of armed conflict between the Ugandan Government and the rebel group Lord's Resistance Army (LRA).

#### 2.2. Study procedure

Study data were collected between August and September 2010. The eligibility criteria required participants to be in their second or third year of secondary education, aged between 13 and 21 years and had the ability to comprehend study procedures and provide informed consent. Research assistants reviewed the study questionnaires with local mental health staff and teachers to ensure local validity and were pretested. Class teachers were asked to distribute study questionnaires to students who were present in class on a given day and were eligible to participate in the study. All questionnaires were administered in English, the official language used in schools. Those who declined or withdrew participation were not required to give reasons. The questionnaires were anonymous and self-administered during regular school hours and took approximately an hour to complete. The adolescents were given pens as a gift for participation and opportunities for support and referral for mental health services were available to all participants. The research protocol was approved by Gulu University Research Ethics Committee, the Ethics Committee at the faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences of Ghent as well as the Uganda National Council of Science and Technology.

#### 2.3. Study measures

## 2.3.1. Socio-demographic variables

In a socio-demographic questionnaire, participants reported their age, gender, ethnicity, living situation, marital status of parents and whether their parents were still alive or not.

## 2.3.2. Trauma exposure variables

Past childhood adverse events were assessed using the Adverse Childhood Exposure (ACE) questionnaire (Bruffaerts et al., 2010). The ACE examines six context-specific intra-familial childhood adversities: not growing up with parents, death of a parent, financial adversity (1.e. dependence on food aid for at least six months), and physical abuse by parents and by other adults, sexual abuse, and witnessing fights between the parents before the age of 13 years. The Cronbach & for this sample was 0.94 indicating good reliability. A total ACE score was computed for each participant and was modeled as a continuous variable in our analyses.

Potentially traumatic war exposure was measured using the Stressful War Events (SWE) questionnaire (Derluyn et al., 2009). This 17-item questionnaire was designed specifically for waraffected adolescents in this region, and included questions referring to a specific war-related traumatic event, such as ""Did you experience living in an internally displaced persons camp?""

## 2.3.3. Mental health variables

Depression and anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-37 for Adolescents (HSCL-37A) (Bean et al., 2007), a self-report questionnaire that previously had been used in war-affected and refugee populations (Derluyn et al., 2008; Mels et al., 2010). Thirty-seven items inquire the severity of DSM-IV based symptoms associated with depression (15 items), anxiety (10) and externalizing problems (12), using a 4-point Likert scale from 1 (never) to 4 (always). The Cronbach's alphas for the depression and anxiety subscales were 83 and 78 respectively. Total depression and anxiety scores were computed for each participant and were modeled as continuous variables in our analyses.

Post-traumatic stress symptoms were assessed using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) (Weiss and Marmar, 1997), a 22-items scale consisting of three subscales of intrusion, avoidance and hyperarousal. The IES-R has already been administered in war-affected adolescent populations in Africa (Amone-P'olak et al., 2007; Mels et al., 2010). Respondents were asked to identify a specific event endorsed on the SWE questionnaire as a reference point for completing the IES-R, and indicate how much it distressed them in the past month by rating each item on a 5-point Likert scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). The Cronbach a for this sample was 0.94 indicating good reliability. A total IES-R score was computed for each participant and was modeled as a continuous variable in our analyses.

## 2.3.4. Anti-social behaviors

In this study, aggressive and rule breaking behaviors were regarded as the antisocial behaviors and were measured using the aggressive and rule breaking behavior syndrome scales of the YSR (Achenbach, 1991). Total scores for each study participant were computed. Binary variables were created whereby study participants whose total scores were greater than the mean score for the study sample were regarded as having high levels of aggression or rule breaking (coded 1) and study participants whose total scores were less than the mean score of the study sample were regarded as having low levels of aggression or rule breaking (coded 0).

#### 2.3.5. Suicidal behaviors

Suicidal behavior was assessed using two items from the Youth Self Report (i.e. ""I deliberately try to hurt or kill myself"" and ""I think about killing myself""). A binary variable was created whereby study participants who endorsed either of the two items were regarded as having suicidal behavior(coded 1) and study participants who did not endorse any of the two items were regarded as not having any suicidal behavior (coded 0).

## 2.3.6. Substance use

Substance use was assessed using three items on the vouth self-report including ""I drink alcohol without my parents' approval, I smoke, chew or sniff tobacco, and I smoke or chew marijuana"". Study participants who endorsed any one of the three items were regarded as having substance use behavior (coded 1) while those who did not endorse any of the three items were regarded as not having substance use behavior (coded 0). The YSR items are rated based on the preceding month, on a 3-point likert scale ranging from 0=Not true to 2=Very true. All scores above 1 were considered as risk and 0 no risk.

## 2.3.7. Sexual risk behaviors

Assessment of sexual risk behavior was based on a single question about whether one was sexually active or not. Given that in the Acholi culture adolescents are not expected to be having sex, those who were sexually active were regarded as being at risk for HIV infection and other sexually transmitted diseases. We created a binary variable in which individuals who were sexually active were coded 1 and those who did not report any sexual activity were coded 0.

#### 2.3.8. Multiple risk behaviors

Study participants who had three or more of the following risk behavior categories including sexual risk behavior, high levels of aggression, high levels of rule breaking, suicidal and substance use behaviors were regarded as having multiple risk behaviors (coded 1) while those who had less than three categories of these risk behaviors were regarded as not having multiple risk behaviors.

#### 2.4. Statistical analyses

First, we performed simple logistic regression analyses to explore any gender differences in participant characteristics, internalizing symptoms and trauma exposure and specific risk behaviors. Second, we performed simple logistic regression analyses to determine

bivariate associations between various participant characteristics, internalizing symptoms and trauma exposure and multiple risk behaviors. Third, we conducted multivariate logistic regression analyses in which adjusted odds ratios and 95% CIs were computed for the effect of stressful war events on multiple risk behaviors while controlling for all the potential confounders including orphan status, anxiety and post-traumatic-stress symptoms as well as sociodemographic characteristics. Stepwise logistic regression was used to determine factors independently associated with multiple risk behaviors. Lastly, to evaluate the mediating effect of depression symptoms, we used the logistic regression model proposed by Baron and Kenny (1986). Mediation was said to occur if (1) stressful war events significantly predicted multiple risk behaviors, (2) depression symptoms predicted multiple risk behaviors, and (3) if the effect of stressful war events on multiple risk behaviors was reduced or eliminated when depression symptoms were included in the regression model(Baron and Kenny 1986).

# 3. Results

Of the 600 students approached to take part in the study, 551 (92%) completed the questionnaires. Baseline characteristics of male and female adolescents are presented in Table 1. Using simple logistic regression models, we found that there were significant gender differences with regard to trauma exposure and mental symptoms. In comparison to males, females were younger and more likely to be total orphans, had higher mean total scores of stressful war and adverse childhood events, higher mean scores of anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress symptoms.

Further, using simple logistic regression models, we found that there were significant gender differences with regard to specific risk behaviors in our study population (Table 2). In comparison to males, females were more likely to have high sexual risk, high levels of aggression and suicidal behavior than males while males were more likely to have high levels of rule breaking behavior than females. Substance use was comparable between the two genders. Multiple risk behaviors were significantly more among females than males.

Table 3 presents the factors associated with having multiple risk behaviors in simple logistic regression models. Table 4 presents the results of the multiple logistic regressions examining factors independently associated with having multiple risk behaviors. The results show that depression symptoms (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]= 1.10, 95% Cl=(1.04-1.12), p < 0.001) and adverse childhood events (AOR=1.25, 95% CI=1.06-1.48, p=0.02) were independently associated with having multiple risk behaviors while living with siblings (AOR=0.16, 95% Cl=0.04-0.7, p=0.02) or both parents (AOR=0.40, 95% Cl=0.10-1.50, p=0.17) were protective against multiple risk behaviors.

#### 3.1. Analyses of the mediating role of depression symptoms

Fig. 1 shows that depression symptoms mediate the association between stressful war events and multiple risk behaviors. The direct effect of stressful war events on multiple risk behavior adjusted for age, gender and adverse childhood events was statistically significant (OR=1.07, 95% Cl=1.00-1.14, p=0.043). The linear regression of depression symptoms scores on stressful war events scores showed that there was a significant relationship between stressful war events and the proposed mediator, depression symptoms (β=0.14, 95% Cl=0.09–1.18, p < 0.001). The logistic regression of multiple risk behaviors on depression symptoms showed a significant association (OR=1.11, 95% CI=1.07-1.14, p < 0.001). In the final model, when both variables stressful war events and depression symptoms were entered into the regression equation, a previously significant association between stressful war events and multiple risk behaviors was no longer significant (OR=1.04, 95% CI=0.97-1.11, p=0.27).

#### 4. Discussion

There are three major findings in this study. First, there were significant gender differences in socio-demographics, mental health symptoms and risk behaviors among school-going adolescents in post-conflict northern Uganda. In comparison to male adolescents, females were significantly younger, more likely to live with a divorced parent and had significantly higher depression, PTSD

and anxiety scores. Regarding, specific risk behaviors, females had significantly higher aggression scores and more suicidal behaviors while males had significantly higher rule breaking scores. Both gender had comparable substance use behaviors. Previous studies of adolescent populations in post-conflict settings report similar findings for internalizing symptoms (Acierno et al., 2000; Schiff et al., 2007; Dyregrov et al., 2000), rule breaking (Pat-Horenczyk et al., 2007) and suicidal behavior (Acierno et al., 2000; Young, 2010). The finding of females being more aggressive than males is in contrast to what most studies have found (Amone-P'olak et al., 2007; Qouta et al., 2008; Sibai et al., 2009). Some authors (Acierno et al., 2000; Bjorkqvist et al., 1992) suggest that although males engage in more physical aggression, females engage in more relational violence or indirect aggression than males, which could explain

this finding. Further, higher exposure of females to both war-related and intra-familial events could have led to learned behavior related to exposure (Acierno et al., 2000), while higher PTSD symptoms, such as hyper-arousal, numbing, dissociation (Allwood et al., 2011; Pat-Horenczyk et al., 2007) may be at play in augmenting risk behavior participation.

However, a significant rise in female delinquency and overt aggression has been reported, indicating that such differences between males and females are narrowing (Acierno et al., 2000; Odgers and Moretti, 2002). Our findings indicate the need for gender specific interventions for suicide and anti-social behaviors.

Second, similar to findings from previous studies (Klasen et al., 2010); (Pat-Horenczyk et al., 2007), this study revealed a high prevalence rate of multiple risk behaviors in this study population. One in four adolescents had three or more risk behaviors. There is need for more research to determine whether the high rate of multiple risk behaviors are unique to this war-affected sample or is developmentally normal and part of adolescent development and thus a way of coping with the stressful events (Acierno et al., 2000; Rolison and Scherman, 2002).

Third, depression was the only internalizing symptom that was independently associated with multiple risk behavior. Although literature on each type of externalizing risk behaviors is rich (Garbarino and Kostelny, 1996) and particular mechanisms of effect may vary by type (e.g., self-medication for alcohol problems; hostile attributions for aggression), there are similarities across types in that many theories explain the role of negative affectivity as a precipitating risk factor.

Interestingly, adverse childhood events were also independently associated with multiple risk behaviors. Other researchers have found evidence of an association between childhood

adversities and risk behaviors in adolescence (Bruffaerts et al., 2010; Cabrera et al., 2007) but this relationship needs further study among war affected adolescents. Potential pathways for explaining these relationships include the possibility that adolescents with a history of childhood adversities may be more likely to be involved in deviant social networks, which then leads to a normalization of risky behaviors, such as having multiple sexual partners (Acierno et al., 2000). Another possibility is that experiencing adversity early in life has a negative effect on overall interpersonal functioning, increasing the likelihood of engaging in multiple risk behaviors or become involved with risky and deviant peers.

Lastly, although theoretically PTSD symptoms have been explicated as a mediator between war exposures and risk behaviors (Taft et al., 2007), this study found that the association between stressful war events and multiple risk behaviors was mediated by depression symptoms and not PTSD. Depression symptoms might mediate the association between stressful war events and multiple risk behaviors through different processes. Some authors (Acierno et al., 2000; Watson et al., 1988) have suggested a general negative affectivity perspective in which clustering of negative affective symptoms such as depressed mood occurs following exposure to war stress The experience of negative affect may then increase the risk for engaging in risk behaviors that function as a way to cope with the mood symptoms (Wills et al., 2002).

These results should be viewed within the context of the following limitations. This study relied on self-report data, and thus it is possible that they were affected by a social desirability bias. Moreover, a cross-sectional study such as this did find an association between depressive symptoms and exposure to violence, but could not confirm the causality. Knowledge of the psychometric properties of the ACE and SWE questionnaires is limited. Although the measures were developed with the assistance of Ugandan mental health workers familiar with the types of war events children experienced in Uganda, it is possible that the list was not exhaustive. Although the IESR and HSCL-37A are the most frequently used measures of children's post trauma reactions (Mels et al., 2010), they assess different symptoms and thus different aspects of trauma reactions. Therefore, it is unclear whether differences between the relation of IESR and HSCL-37A scores to trauma exposure and risk behaviors reflect reporter differences or construct differences. Finally, despite the merits of our findings, it is important to consider issues of construct and content validity with an African sample. Ethnocultural variation may decrease the validity of the PTSD construct as well as the validity of our measures.

This study has some important clinical and research implications. It is apparent that longitudinal studies are necessary to develop a clearer understanding of the complex relationships between childhood adversity, stressful war events and multiple risk behaviors, given the limited role for PTSD in this sample. It is also important that future work examines how specific forms of abuse including physical, sexual, and emotional abuse occurring at different developmental stages affect multiple risk behaviors. In addition, future work should examine potential mediators of these relationships including social support, attachment, and psychopathology. Finally, there is a clear need for the development, assessment, and refinement of interventions targeting adolescents who engage in multiple risk behaviors that take into account both contextual and historical influences on these behaviors.

To conclude, the present findings extend previous findings (Pat-Horenczyk et al., 2007;Schiff et al., 2007, 2012) suggesting that cumulative exposure to events during war and internalizing symptoms associated with such exposure are risk factors for involvement in multiple risk behaviors, not only during the exposure, but even 4 years later. The study identifies the connection between experiences in war and multiple risk behaviors and has implications for psychological assessment and early intervention for school- based adolescents post-war.

Older adults with schizophrenia experience poorer community integration and social functioning compared to same-age peers with no mental health disorders; these individuals are at elevated risk for functional decline and early institutionalization in long-term care facilities. Deficits in thought, language, and communication (TLC; that is, thought disorder and alogia) are core features of schizophrenia and may worsen with age; however, little research focuses on the functional sequelae of these impairments among older adults with schizophrenia. The present study aimed to examine the relationships among age, TLC deficits, and functional outcomes in a sample of community-dwelling middle-aged and older adults with schizophrenia (N=245; ages 40-85). Participants completed assessments of symptoms, neurocognition, TLC deficits, and functional outcomes. Two different categories of TLC deficits were examined: verbal underproductivity (i.e., alogia) and disconnected speech. Regression analyses, controlling for gender, age, Veteran status, smoking status, cognitive impairment, and symptom severity, found that disconnected speech predicted occupational functioning, while verbal underproductivity predicted capacity to communicate skillfully in semi-structured social situations, as well as community functioning across interpersonal, occupational, and everyday living domains. Exploratory mediation analyses found significant indirect effects of age, through TLC deficits, on certain functional outcomes. Targeted training to improve TLC deficits, especially verbal underproductivity, among older adults with schizophrenia could have downstream effects on community functioning, improving outcomes for a vulnerable group.

# 1. Introduction

Community-dwelling older adults with schizophrenia experience poorer community integration and social functioning when compared to their same-age peers, including elevated rates of unemployment, underperformance in everyday activities, and social isolation (Abdallah et al., 2009; Madiedo et al., 2012; Meesters et al., 2010). Moreover, older adults with schizophrenia are vastly overrepresented in nursing homes (Miller et al., 2006; Miller et al., 2007) and are at increased risk for nursing home placement as early as their forties (Andrews et al., 2009). This indicates that, although there is great heterogeneity in outcomes as individuals with schizophrenia age (Jeste et al., 2011), for some, aging may be accompanied by faster and more severe functional decline than that experienced by their same-age peers without psychiatric disorders. Further elucidation of the factors which contribute to poor functional outcomes in community-dwelling older adults with schizophrenia is necessary to inform targeted interventions for this group.

While cognitive decline accounts for worsening of functional outcomes in older adults with schizophrenia in some cases (Reichenberg et al., 2014), research indicates that only a subset of these individuals exhibit substantial cognitive decline with age (Harvey et al., 2010; Thompson et al., 2013). Additionally, while considerable research has examined the relationships among neurocognition, symptom severity, and functional outcomes in adults

with schizophrenia (e.g., Bowie et al., 2006), much less attention has focused on one of the cardinal features of the illness: impairments in thought, language, and communication.

Thought, language, and communication (TLC) deficits, also referred to as formal thought disorder and alogia, are common in schizophrenia, and are associated with impairments in everyday functioning (Racenstein et al., 1999; Bowie et al., 2011). TLC deficits are thought to fall into two categories: ""positive"" thought disorder, characterized by the presence of disorganized, circumstantial, or tangential speech, and ""negative"" thought disorder (i.e., alogia), characterized by an absence of speech production (Andreasen, 1986). Previous research with chronically institutionalized older patients with schizophrenia, both ""positive"" TLC deficits (hereafter referred to as disconnected speech) and ""negative"" TLC deficits (hereafter referred to as verbal underproductivity) were associated with deficits in social outcomes, but not with deficits in other functional domains (e.g., activities of daily living, recreation; Bowie & Harvey, 2008). Additionally, verbal underproductivity worsened with age, especially among the older-old and oldest-old patients (ages 74 and up; Bowie et al., 2005). Importantly, the relationships among age, TLC deficits, and functional outcomes have not been examined in community-dwelling older adults with schizophrenia, for whom adaptive functioning may be much more dependent on the ability to skillfully communicate.

Previous studies on TLC deficits and functional outcomes in schizophrenia have generally relied on consumer or informant reports of everyday functioning (Racenstein et al., 1999; Bowie & Harvey, 2008). One limitation of this approach is that real-world functional performance may be influenced by factors beyond a consumer's communication abilities, such as socioenvironmental constraints. Therefore, it is unknown whether TLC deficits are associated with poorer functional outcomes because they directly influence a consumer's ability to successfully communicate (i.e., a consumer cannot communicate his/her thoughts or needs when given the opportunity) or because that consumer has fewer opportunities to communicate (i.e., TLC deficits lead to increased social isolation and fewer opportunities for interaction). To address this, performance-based measures of functioning, which prompt participants to demonstrate social and occupational skills through in-vivo tasks, may be used. These measures capture functional capacity, or their ability to accomplish activities of daily living under optimal conditions (Bowie et al., 2006). The only study to examine the association of TLC deficits with functional capacity in adults with schizophrenia, found that both verbal underproductivity and disconnected speech were associated with performance on in-vivo, social skills based role plays (Bowie et al., 2011). These associations have not been examined in an older adult sample of individuals with schizophrenia.

The present study aimed to further elucidate the association of TLC deficits and functional outcomes among community-dwelling middle-aged and older adults with schizophrenia. We aimed to examine, adjusting for demographic factors, cognitive impairment, and symptom severity, whether verbal underproductivity and disconnected speech would be associated with poorer clinician-rated community functioning across occupational, everyday living, and interpersonal domains. Secondly, we aimed to examine, again adjusting for demographic factors, cognitive impairment, and symptom severity, whether verbal underproductivity and disconnected speech would be associated with poorer performance on laboratory social skills tasks and functional tasks of communication. Exploratory analyses tested whether

TLC deficits mediated relationships between age and functional outcomes, to explain the greater functional deficits seen in older people with schizophrenia.

### 2. Methods

#### 2.1. Participants

This study presents analyses of baseline data from a large longitudinal study, which assessed the course of cognition and functioning in a sample of community-dwelling adults with schizophrenia (see Bowie et al., 2006 for more details on methodology). The present analyses utilized data from all participants with a schizophrenia diagnosis, ages 40 and up, who completed baseline assessments for the study (n = 245; see Table 1). Participants were recruited through academic, state, and VA outpatient treatment programs, and were required to meet criteria for a primary DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, as assessed through the Comprehensive Assessment of Symptoms and History (Andreasen et al., 1992). Additionally, individuals needed to exhibit evidence of current active illness at baseline assessment, as evidenced by an inpatient hospitalization or emergency room visit for psychosis within the last two years, or at least moderate levels of positive symptoms. Exclusion criteria were the presence of medical illnesses that could impact cognitive functioning, and a Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE; Folstein et al., 1975) score below 18.

### 2.2. Procedures

All study procedures were approved by the appropriate institutional review boards and participants completed written informed consent prior to participating in any study activities. Eligible participants completed assessments of cognition, functional and communication skills, and symptoms. All assessments were completed by trained raters. Participants' case managers completed ratings of community functioning within one week of the assessments.

## 2.3. Measures

Demographic information and smoking status were ascertained from the participant. Height, weight, and presence of diabetes and heart disease were ascertained by chart review when available.

2.3.1 Symptom Severity-The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS; Kay, 1991) was used as a measure of clinical symptom severity. The PANSS is comprised of 30 individual items that are scored using seven point Likert scales (1= absent, 7= extreme) and was rated through a structured interview with the participant and collateral information (i.e., chart review and clinician informant). The interrater reliability for this measure was high (Bowie & Harvey, 2008). The PANSS Positive and PANSS Negative scale scores were calculated excluding three individual items, due to their high overlap with TLC: conceptual disorganization, lack of spontaneity and flow of conversation, and social withdrawal (Bowie & Harvey, 2008). The widely used and well-validated Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; Beck, Steer, & Brown, 1986) was used as a measure of depression symptom severity.

Muralidharan et al.

2.3.2. Global Cognition-Global cognitive functioning was assessed through comprehensive neuropsychological assessment. Age-based norms were used to produce standard scores, and these scores were combined to create a cognitive composite score which included the following domains: constructional praxis, attention and concentration, executive functioning, and verbal learning, memory, and fluency. For a detailed description of the cognitive composite see Bowie et al. (2006).

2.3.3. TLC Deficits-The Thought, Language, and Communications (TLC) Scale is an 18item interviewer-rated measure of thought disorder, based on participant speech and communication during unscripted conversation (Andreasen, 1986). The TLC scale has been successfully used in previous research to measure two subtypes of TLC deficits: disconnected speech (TLC\_DS) and verbal underproductivity (TLC\_VU; Bowie et al., 2005; Bowie & Harvey, 2008). TLC DS is calculated as a mean of a six items representing loose or incoherent speech (e.g., tangentiality, circumstantiality), while TLC\_VU was defined by the poverty of speech item. This use of the TLC measure has demonstrated adequate-to-good interrater reliability (Bowie et al., 2005; Bowie & Harvey, 2008; Harvey et al., 1997).

2.3.4. Performance-Based Measures of Functional Capacity-Performance-based functional and social skills were measured using the UCSD Performance-Based Skills Assessment (UPSA; Patterson et al., 2001) and the Social Skills Performance Assessment (SSPA; Patterson et al., 2001). The UPSA was created to assess functional skills among older outpatients with serious mental illness in five domains: communication, finance, transportation, planning recreational activities, and household chores (Bowie et al., 2006). For the purposes of this study, the communication domain (UPSA communication) was utilized as a measure of functional communication abilities. Participants completed a series of task-oriented role plays (e.g., making an emergency phone call) assessing their ability to successfully complete each communication task, producing a communication subscale score, with higher scores indicating better performance.

The SSPA involves a series of role plays performed between the participant and the interviewer. Role plays are less structured and involve unscripted communication with the interviewer in two different ""scenes"": greeting a new neighbor and negotiating with a landlord. These scored role plays follow a practice scene where the participant has to make plans with a friend. Role plays are coded on a scale from 1 to 5 (1=low; 5=high) on the following items: interest, fluency, clarity, focus, affect, grooming, negotiation ability, submission, overall argument/overall conversation, and social appropriateness. The mean score (SSPA mean) represents a global estimate of social skill level for each participant. The SSPA has good test-retest and interrater reliability (Patterson et al., 2001).

2.3.5. Community Functioning-Community functioning was assessed through the Specific Level of Function Scale (SLOF; Schneider & Struening, 1983). This measure has high interrater reliability, internal consistency, and factorial validity (Bowie et al., 2006; Harvey et al., 2011). The SLOF contains 43 items rated on a 5-point Likert scale. Ratings are based on informant report of an individual's performance across six functional domains. The relevant domains for the present analyses were: interpersonal relationships (SLOF interpersonal; e.g., forming friendships), daily activities (SLOF activities; e.g., shopping,

taking medication, handling personal finances), and work skills (SLOF work; e.g., has employable skills). Case managers who had at least a 'very good' (score 4 or 5 on a 5 point scale) knowledge of the participants rated these items within one week of the assessment and they were unaware of any of the other assessment results.

#### 2.4. Data Analysis

First, multiple linear regression analyses were performed to test our primary hypotheses, with the following measures as outcome variables: SLOF work, SLOF activities, SLOF interpersonal, UPSA communication, and SSPA mean. In each regression, gender, Veteran status, and smoking status were entered simultaneously in the first step. Then, age, global cognitive impairment, depression severity, positive symptom severity, and negative symptom severity were entered simultaneously in the next step. Then, TLC\_DS and TLC\_VU were entered in the final step as predictor variables. Cumulative R-squared statistics were generated to examine the relative contribution of each step in the model. Finally, for each functional outcome which had at least one TLC measure as a significant predictor, an exploratory mediation analysis was conducted using the PROCESS macro for SPSS. For each mediation analysis, gender, Veteran status, smoking status, global cognitive impairment, depression symptom severity, positive symptom severity, and negative symptom severity were entered as covariates in the model, with age as the predictor and TLC\_VU and/or TLC\_DS as mediators, depending on which TLC measures were significant predictors in the regression model for that functional outcome. PROCESS uses a bootstrapping, regression-based procedure to estimate the magnitude and significance of the indirect effect (Hayes, 2013); in this analysis, if the confidence interval does not include zero, the indirect effect is assumed to be significant. Number of bootstrap samples was set to 5,000.

# 3. Results

Demographics and descriptive statistics are presented in Table 1. Age ranged from 40 to 85 years. All participants were receiving antipsychotic and/or other psychotropic medication(s). Among participants for whom chart data was available (~70%), the majority of participants were overweight or obese (mean BMI = 30.34 +/- 7.05), 14.2% had Type I or II diabetes, and 5.9% had heart disease. Missing data was less than 10% for all variables in the analyses except the SLOF scale, which was missing for approximately 20% of participants, typically due to lack of availability of or responsiveness from a case manager with sufficient knowledge of the participant. All available data was used for each analysis, resulting in different sample sizes for each analysis. Bivariate correlations among variables are displayed in Table 2; because a number of variables exhibited non-normality, especially the TLC and SLOF scales, Spearman's rho correlations are reported. Older age was associated with worse performance on the UPSA and the SSPA, more disconnected speech, and poorer performance on work and everyday activities. Higher performance on cognitive tests was associated with less verbal underproductivity, better work and everyday activity performance, and better scores on the UPSA and SSPA.

Muralidharan et al.

Results from regression analyses are displayed in Table 3. All analyses controlled for gender, Veteran status, smoking status, age, global cognitive impairment, depression symptom severity, positive symptom severity, and negative symptom severity. TLC DS and TLC\_VU were significantly associated with SLOF work, explaining 4.7% additional variance, collectively. TLC\_VU was also significantly associated with SLOF activities (explaining 4.8% additional variance), SLOF interpersonal (explaining 4.8% additional variance), and SSPA mean (explaining 3.4% additional variance). All regression models met assumptions of approximately normal distribution of residuals, with no evidence of problematic multicollinearity or autocorrelation.

Exploratory mediation analyses indicated that, controlling for gender, Veteran status, smoking status, age, global cognitive impairment, depression symptom severity, positive symptom severity, and negative symptom severity, TLC\_VU mediated the relationships between age and SLOF interpersonal (95% CI = -. 050, -. 001). TLC\_DS mediated the relationship between age and SLOF work (95% CI= -. 002). The TLC measures were not significant mediators in any other mediation analysis.

# 4. Discussion

Older adults with schizophrenia were previously reported to exhibit age-related changes in cognition, communication, and everyday functioning. In this sample of community-dwelling middle-aged and older adults with schizophrenia, TLC deficits were associated with poorer functioning across occupational, interpersonal, and everyday living domains, accounting for between 3.4% and 4.8% of the variance in community functioning. This is in contrast to previous work with chronically institutionalized older adults with schizophrenia, which found that TLC deficits were solely associated with social functioning deficits (Bowie & Harvey, 2008). It may be that in a sample that consisted of a chronically institutionalized population, occupational and self-care functioning was generally limited in terms of opportunities; this lack of variance may have precluded significant associations between TLC deficits and functional outcomes. Alternatively, functional outcomes may be less dependent on communication skills for older adults with schizophrenia in long-term care facilities, who have access to structure and support in performing activities of daily living and recreation. In contrast, adaptive functioning for older adults with schizophrenia in the community requires proactive engagement and seeking out of opportunities, which is highly dependent on communication skills. Community-dwelling older adults with schizophrenia could benefit from targeted treatment aimed at improving TLC deficits.

Findings suggest that disconnected speech and verbal underproductivity are associated with functional outcomes in different ways. Disconnected speech was associated with deficits in work skills, but not with deficits in other areas of community functioning. Verbal underproductivity, on the other hand, was associated with deficits across multiple domains of functioning. It makes intuitive sense that reduced verbal output would be associated with decreased success in interpersonal relationships, posing a barrier to initiating and maintaining conversations and friendships; this was in fact, one of the functional domains in which verbal underproductivity accounted for the most variance (4.8%). In addition, verbal underproductivity was associated with poorer performance in semi-structured social

Muralidharan et al.

situations (accounting for 3.4% of the variance explained), but not with social skills tasks with specific instructions. Therefore, with structure, older adults with schizophrenia may be able to overcome verbal underproductivity to accomplish specific tasks or activities. However, verbal underproductivity poses a barrier to connecting with others or expressing one's needs in less structured interactions. Verbal underproductivity was also associated with poorer work skills and performance of daily activities; these associations are more difficult to explain. Poverty of speech in and of itself should not prevent an individual from successfully completing work tasks without supervision, for example, or engaging in daily activities such as taking care of household chores or managing his/her personal finances. It may be that verbal underproductivity is associated with general social isolation, which leads to decreased opportunities to engage in activities of daily living and demonstrate functional skills.

Exploratory analyses examined whether TLC deficits mediated the link between older age and poorer functional outcomes. Findings indicated that disconnected speech mediated the link between age and poorer work functioning. In addition, the effect of age on interpersonal functioning was mediated through verbal underproductivity. Given that older age is associated with greater social isolation in the general population (Cattan et al., 2005), and with increased verbal underproductivity with age among adults with schizophrenia (Bowie et al., 2005), the interaction of these factors could lead to even greater social isolation and poorer functional outcomes. Worsening in TLC deficits with age could contribute to functional decline among older adults with schizophrenia. These individuals may benefit from skills training with a focus on decreasing disconnected speech, which could improve performance on work tasks, and increasing verbal output in unstructured social situations, which could have downstream effects across functional domains.

The present study utilized a large sample of an understudied population; namely, community-dwelling middle-aged and older adults with schizophrenia, including older-old individuals in their 70's and 80's. In addition the present study utilized rigorous clinical assessment procedures, and ratings of community functioning were made by independent observers who were not involved in other study assessments. While these are considerable strengths, there are also limitations of note. This is a post-hoc analysis on data which were not collected to test the hypotheses put forth here; thus these findings need to be confirmed in a prospective hypothesis testing study. Data analyses included multiple comparisons, increasing risk for Type I error. In addition, participant scores on the TLC measure were generally low, indicating generally low levels of thought disorder and alogia in the sample. At the same time, participant scores on the community functioning measure were generally high, indicating a relatively high-functioning sample. This restriction of range may have led to an underestimate of the association between TLC deficits and functional outcomes. Furthermore, the sample was predominantly male and restricted to individuals with active illness; thus, the findings may not apply to largely female groups or to asymptomatic individuals with schizophrenia. In addition, we were unable to account for the effects of psychotropic medications on TLC deficits or functional outcomes. We also did not have a measure of family or social support so could not examine the impact of these variables on outcomes. Finally, given that this is a cross-sectional study, causal conclusions regarding the associations among the variables cannot be made. Future studies should examine the impact
of TLC deficits on functioning in a sample with greater variance in TLC deficits, and could utilize a longitudinal research design.

In conclusion, in a sample of community-dwelling middle-aged and older adults with schizophrenia, TLC deficits were associated with poorer community functioning across domains, even when controlling for demographic factors, symptom severity, and cognitive impairment. Disconnected speech was associated with deficits in task-oriented social skills and occupational functioning, while verbal underproductivity was associated with poorer performance in unstructured social interactions, and poorer community functioning across occupational, interpersonal, and recreational domains. Targeted training to improve these deficits among older adults with schizophrenia could improve social skills performance and have downstream effects on community functioning, improving functional outcomes for a vulnerable and complex group.

# Passion, Trait Self-Control, and Wellbeing: Comparing Two Mediation Models Predicting Wellbeing

#### Walid Briki \*

Sport Science Program, College of Arts and Sciences, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar

Research has found that passion and trait self-control represented key determinants of wellbeing. Yet, no study to date has attempted to investigate the mediating influences of trait self-control and passion for accounting for the relationships between passion, trait self-control, and wellbeing (dependent variable). Using different frameworks, such as the dualistic model of passion and the neo-socioanalytic theory, the present study proposed two mediation models, considering either trait self-control (model 1) or passion (model 2) as the mediating variable. Five hundred nine volunteers from the United States (326 females and 183 males; Mage = 31.74, SDage = 11.05, from 18 to 70 years old), who reported being passionate about a specific activity (e.g., fishing, swimming, blogging; Massion = 5.94, SDpassion = 0.89), answered questionnaires assessing harmonious and obsessive passion, trait self-control, and wellbeing (measured through hedonic and eudaimonic wellbeing scales). Preliminary analyses revealed that both models were significant (model 1: absolute GoF = 0.366, relative GoF = 0.971, outer model GoF = 0.997, inner model GoF = 0.973, R² = 18.300%, p < 0.001; model 2: absolute GoF = 0.298; relative GoF = 0.980; outer model GoF = 0.997; inner model GoF = 0.982; P2 = 12.111%, p < 0.001). Correlational analyses revealed positive relationships between harmonious passion, trait self-control, and wellbeing, and no relationships of obsessive passion with trait self-control and wellbeing. Mediation analyses revealed that trait self-control significantly mediated the relationship between harmonious passion and wellbeing (i.e., partial mediation, VAF = 33.136%). Harmonious passion appeared to significantly mediate the positive effect of trait self-control on wellbeing; however, the size of the mediating effect indicated that (almost) no mediation would take place (i.e., VAF = 11.144%). The present study is the first to examine the relationships between passion, trait self-control, and wellbeing, and supports the view that trait self-control and harmonious passion represent not only adaptive and powerful constructs, but also key determinants of wellbeing. Implications for the study of passion, trait self-control and wellbeing are discussed.

Positive psychology is ""...the scientific study of what makes life worth living"" (Peterson and Park, 2014, p. 2). In that regard, the questions raised by that field of study are about happiness and wellbeing. Wellbeing encompasses two forms: Hedonic (or subjective) and eudaimonic wellbeing. Hedonic wellbeing corresponds to "" ... people's evaluations of their livesthe degree to which their thoughtful appraisals and affective reactions indicate that their lives are desirable and proceeding well"" (Diener et al., 2015, p. 234). Eudaimonic wellbeing is defined as ""... the striving for perfection that represents the realization of one's true potential"" (Ryff, 1995, p. 100). In other words, hedonic wellbeing emphasizes the pursuit of pleasurable experiences, whereas eudaimonic wellbeing emphasizes the pursuit of a meaningful life (Peterson and Park, 2014; Vallerand, 2015). Wellbeing has elicited the interest of politicians, economists, philosophers, and psychologists around the world since studies revealed that happiness predicted performance, moral behavior, health, and longevity (e.g., Diener, 2000; De Neve et al., 2013; Diener et al., 2015). Therefore, besides the fact that wellbeing represents a significant interest to a worldwide audience, examining its predictive factors is of great importance.

Vallerand (2015) argued that being ""... passionate about a meaningful activity (or object or even a person) can provide joy and meaning to one's life that contributes to having a life worth living"" (p. 10). Passion can be defined as "" ... a strong inclination toward a self-defining activity that one likes (or even loves), finds important, and in which one invests time and energy on a regular basis"" (Vallerand, 2012, p. 3). Following that perspective, Vallerand and his colleagues investigated the effects of passion on wellbeing and revealed that being harmoniously or obsessively passionate could influence wellbeing differently (e.g., Rousseau and Vallerand, 2008; Philippe et al., 2009; Carpentier et al., 2012; Verner-Filion et al., 2017). Additionally, they revealed that positive emotions, flow experiences, ruminations, satisfaction of basic psychological needs, and achievement goals could account for such effects (Rousseau and Vallerand, 2008; Carpentier et al., 2012; Verner-Filion et al., 2017).

Furthermore, De Ridder and Gillebaart (2016) argued that trait self-control represents a key predictor of wellbeing. Trait self-control refers to a dispositional capacity leading to the optimization of the regulation of goal-directed processes, thereby promoting task completion (De Ridder and Gillebaart, 2016). More specifically, because trait self-control ""...involves an 'active self' that is able to prioritize long-term over shortterm goals, even when these short-term goals are immediately gratifying"" (De Ridder and Gillebaart, 2016, p. 1), De Ridder and Gillebaart (2016) supposed that trait self-control could enhance wellbeing through initiating (or inhibiting) desired (or undesired) behaviors, then fostering goal attainment and positive emotions. Investigating the effects of trait self-control on wellbeing, authors revealed that positive emotions, promotion focus (i.e., motivational orientation concerned with gains, advancement, and achievement), and prevention focus (i.e., motivational orientation concerned with losses, vigilance, and ought) could account for the effects of trait self-control on happiness (Cheung et al., 2014; Hofmann et al., 2014).

In sum, passion and trait self-control are key to understanding how people can develop high levels of wellbeing. Therefore, the present study aims at examining (a) the relationships between passion, trait self-control, and wellbeing; (b) two models predicting wellbeing; (c) whether trait self-control can mediate the relationship between passion and wellbeing (i.e., model 1); and (d) whether passion can mediate the relationship between trait self-control and wellbeing (i.e., model 2).

## The Dualistic Model of Passion

The dualistic model of passion (Vallerand et al., 2003; Vallerand and Houlfort, 2003; Vallerand, 2008) posits that two dimensions of passion exist: harmonious and obsessive. Harmonious passion results from an autonomous internalization of the activity in the self, in such a way that self-initiation, volition, and willingness drive harmoniously passionate individuals' behaviors. With harmonious passion, individuals voluntarily take part in their passionate activity and perceive their activity as being under their control (""My passion for playing football allows me to live a variety of experiences"") and well-integrated with other life domains (""My passion for music is in harmony with other things that are part of me""). Obsessive passion results from a controlled internalization of the activity in the self, since internal and external pressure and contingencies drive obsessively passionate individuals' behaviors. With obsessive passion, individuals experience an uncontrollable urge to take part in their activity (""I have the impression that my passion controls me"") and perceive their activity as poorly integrated with other domains of life (""Doing scientific research is so exciting that I sometimes lose controls over it"").

The passionate activity occupies an important space in the identity because it reflects a self-defining activity leading the passionate individual to claim he/she is a practitioner of his/her activity (e.g., ""I am a singer!""). Grounded in the self-determination theory (e.g., Deci and Ryan, 2008a,b), the dualistic model of passion posits that harmonious passion originates from autonomous internalization, which ""...occurs when people have freely accepted an activity as important for them without any contingencies attached to it"" (Vallerand and Miquelon, 2007, p. 252). The dualistic model of passion also posits that obsessive passion originates from controlled internalization, which ""...involves internalizing the activity into one's identity because one feels pressured to do so or because some contingencies are attached to the activity, such as feelings of social acceptance or self-esteem"" (Vallerand and Miquelon, 2007, p. 252). In sum, Vallerand and his colleagues argue that the more (or the less) the social environment is capable of satisfying individuals' needs for competence, relatedness, and, especially, autonomy, the more autonomous (or controlled) internalization develops for the passionate activity.

In all, while harmonious passion reflects an autonomous regulation, obsessive passion reflects a controlled regulation. For that reason, the dualistic model of passion argues that harmonious (or obsessive) passion is expected to entail adaptive (or maladaptive) health-related outcomes, and many studies

have evidenced such assumptions. Indeed, authors showed that harmonious passion predicted positive wellbeing, whereas obsessive passion predicted negative or unpredicted wellbeing (e.g., Vallerand et al., 2007, 2008; Carbonneau et al., 2008; Rousseau and Vallerand, 2008; Philippe et al., 2009; Carpentier et al., 2012; Verner-Filion et al., 2017). More specifically, the authors revealed that harmonious passion has a positive influence on wellbeing through experiencing higher levels of positive emotions, flow (i.e., a state of beatitude and complete concentration on the task), and mastery-approach goals (i.e., the desire to perform the task well; e.g., Rousseau and Vallerand, 2008; Carpentier et al., 2012; Verner-Filion et al., 2017). In contrast, they reported that the detrimental effects of obsessive passion on wellbeing were due to increased and decreased levels of rumination (i.e., repetitive and spontaneous thoughts regarding a specific target) and flow, respectively (Carpentier et al., 2012).

# Can Trait Self-Control Mediate the Relationship between Passion and Wellbeing?

Vallerand and colleagues demonstrated the existence of effective affective and cognitive mediators accounting for the relationships between passion and wellbeing. Following such a perspective, the present article aims at examining whether and how harmonious and obsessive passion might influence wellbeing through trait self-control. Trait self-control reflects the stable capability of the self to operate changes in order to adjust the self to the world (Tangney et al., 2004). Specifically, trait self-control promotes facilitative strategies and overrides goal-disruptive impulses (Tangney et al., 2004; Hagger, 2013, 2014). Recent studies have shown that autonomous (or controlled) regulation positively (or negatively) predicted trait self-control (Briki et al., 2015; Briki, 2016), while trait self-control positively predicted positive emotions and wellbeing (e.g., De Ridder et al., 2012; Cheung et al., 2014; Hofmann et al., 2014; Briki et al., 2015; Briki, 2016). In addition, trait self-control appeared to mediate the positive (or negative) effect of autonomous (or controlled) regulation on wellbeing (Briki et al., 2015; Briki, 2016).

Why would autonomous regulation for a specific activity result in greater levels of trait self-control? Briki (2016) addressed that essential question by combining the following views: (a) autonomous self-control depletes low levels of cognitive resources (e.g., Muraven et al., 2007, 2008); (b) autonomous self-control leads to the internalization of values, goals, and behaviors in an autonomous fashion (Deci and Ryan, 1987, 2000); and (c) autonomously internalized goals promote goal selection operations (Carver and Scheier, 1998). Goal selection corresponds to the ability of the self to embrace self-relevant goals and eschew self-irrelevant ones. Based on these literatures, Briki (2016) argued that autonomous regulation would reinforce trait self-control by endorsing (eschewing) goals that are consistent (inconsistent) with the pursued activity. For example, performing physical exercise for autonomous reasons would raise the desire to move toward healthy/desired goals (e.g., eating enough fruit, going to bed early) and to move away from unhealthy/undesired goals (i.e., anti-goals; e.g., eating fatty foods, drinking alcohol, smoking, going to bed late). He also argued that controlled regulation would thwart adaptive goal selection operations, thereby leading to endorse inappropriate goals with regard to the pursued activity.

Furthermore, because trait self-control affects long-term goals (Carver and Scheier, 1981; De Ridder and Gillebaart, 2016), and because self-relevant goals are supposed to upgrade in priority (Carver, 2015), one can suggest that autonomous regulation would reinforce trait self-control by setting appropriate longterm/abstract goals related to the pursued activity. Indeed, goals are more than cognitive single-steps, but are rather complex entities that are hierarchically organized in the cognitive system (e.g., Carver and Scheier, 1998; DeYoung, 2015) along temporal (i.e., from long-term to short-term goals; Locke and Latham, 1990) and abstraction-related scales (i.e., from abstract to concrete goals; Carver and Scheier, 1998). For example, being autonomously passionate about physical exercise would raise the desire to move toward long-term/abstract desired exercise goals (e.g., improving one's physical fitness, health, and wellbeing) and to move away from long-term/abstract undesired exercise goals (e.g., developing cardiovascular disease, obesity, and depression). Accordingly, autonomous regulation (e.g., harmonious passion) would orientate people's attention toward relevant and suitable long-term/abstract goals (high priority) to the detriment of short-term/concrete goals that would be even immediately gratifying (e.g., eating fatty food) (low priority), whereas controlled regulation would thwart that process. A series of studies support our assumption by revealing that autonomous (or controlled) regulation predicted long-term (or short-term) goals, and that controlled regulation did not predict long-term goals (e.g., Williams and Deci, 1998; Pelletier et al., 2001; see also Deci and Ryan, 2008b for a review).

Finally, we argue here that autonomous regulation (e.g., harmonious passion) would increase trait self-control through cognitive operations of goal selection and reprioritization, thereby promoting the development of self-relevant and successful long-term/abstract and short-term/concrete goals, according to the pursued activity. We also expect that controlled regulation (e.g., obsessive passion) would prevent/thwart such a cognitive process. In other words, we presume that commitment to a specific activity (i.e., being passionate for a given activity) may predict a general emotional and cognitive appraisal (i.e., wellbeing) through a stable cognitive ability (i.e., trait selfcontrol).

# Can Passion Mediate the Relationship between Trait Self-Control and Wellbeing?

Although we have thus far described the mediating role of trait self-control, we have said little about whether passion can account for the beneficial effect of trait self-control on wellbeing. Hence, in that section, we will propose a model delineating a process from the dispositional level (i.e., trait self-control) to the motivational level (i.e., passion) to self-appraisal (i.e., wellbeing).

Personality traits have been identified as powerful predictors of health-related outcomes (Bogg et al., 2008; Hampson, 2012). According to the neo-socioanalytic theory (e.g., Roberts and Wood, 2006), personality is composed of four distinct personality units-i.e., traits (i.e., stable tendencies to think, feel, and act), motives (i.e., things that people need, desire, and strive to reach), abilities (i.e., acquired skills and knowledge), and narratives (i.e., stories about oneself, others, and one's environment). Each personality unit encompasses a hierarchy of components arranged along an abstraction-based scalefrom the most decontextualized to the most contextualized levels-where proximal relations between the components are presumed to be stronger compared to distal relations (i.e., psychological proximity). The theory also posits that strong relations are possible between components pertaining to different personality units. Following that perspective, enjoying exercising (i.e., low-level aftect construct) would be psychologically closer to passion for sport and physical activity (i.e., mid-level exercise identity construct) than trait self-control (i.e., top-level conscientiousness construct). Therefore, we suggest that passion may mediate the influence of trait self-control on emotions experienced while performing the activity.

How do such emotions influence wellbeing (i.e., general appraisal)? Diener et al. (2017) suggested that ""...affect balanceexperiencing more pleasant than unpleasant emotions-is strongly associated with life satisfaction"" (p. 91) and that ""...frequent but mild positive moods may be sufficient"" (p. 94) to developing wellbeing. In other words, the authors indicate that wellbeing results from experiencing repeatedly positive and moderate emotions, supporting studies evidencing that positive emotions develop wellbeing (e.g., Rousseau and Vallerand, 2008; Hofmann et al., 2014). In sum, and in line with authors who demonstrated that trait self-control influenced wellbeing through motivational and emotional constructs (e.g., Cheung et al., 2014; Hofmann et al., 2014), we presume that trait self-control may have a positive impact on wellbeing through passion, which represents a motivational construct deeply rooted in the identity (e.g., Vallerand et al., 2003; Verner-Filion et al., 2017).

## Research Overview

The present study aims at examining the predictive factors of wellbeing by building and comparing two distinct models. The first model is arranged from passion to wellbeing, with trait self-control as a midlevel construct. In that model, we posit that passion for a specific activity may foster wellbeing via the mediating effect of trait self-control. The second model is arranged from trait self-control to wellbeing, with passion as an intermediate construct. In that model, we presume that trait self-control may promote wellbeing through experiencing passion for a specific activity. In both models, we assume that trait self-control would promote the setting of facilitative long-term/abstract and short-term/concrete goals, which would lead to promoting goal attainment and, thus, positive emotions. On the basis of the abovementioned rationale, four categories of hypothesis were proposed:

- (1) Relationships between passion and wellbeing: Consistent with previous studies showing that harmonious passion was positively related to wellbeing, whereas obsessive passion was either negatively related or unrelated to wellbeing (e.g., Carbonneau et al., 2008; Rousseau and Vallerand, 2008; Vallerand et al., 2008; Carpentier et al., 2012), we expect harmonious passion to be positively related to wellbeing. However, no consistent evidence allows us to formulate any prediction regarding the relationship between obsessive passion and wellbeing.
- (2) Relationship between trait self-control and wellbeing: Consistent with previous studies showing that trait self-control was positively associated with wellbeing (e.g., Briki et al., 2015; Briki, 2016), we expect trait self-control to be positively related to wellbeing.
- (3) Relationships between trait self-control and passion: In line with previous studies revealing positive relationships between autonomous functioning and trait self-control, whereas controlled functioning and trait self-control were either negatively related or unrelated (e.g., Briki et al., 2015; Briki, 2016), we expect harmonious passion to be positively related to trait self-control. However, we remained exploratory concerning the relationship between obsessive passion and trait self-control.
- (4) Comparison between the two models and mediations: Given the established theoretical foundations of the two models, we expect them to be effective for predicting wellbeing. Regarding the mediations, and consistent with previous studies indicating that trait self-control mediated the relationship between autonomous functioning and wellbeing (Briki et al., 2015; Briki, 2016), we expect trait self-control to mediate the relationship of harmonious passion with wellbeing (model 1). Moreover, the literature lacks consistency regarding the mediating influence of trait self-control in the relationship between controlled functioning and wellbeing (Briki, 2016; Briki et al., 2015). Thus, the present study remained exploratory concerning that mediation (model 1). In model 2, we expect harmonious passion to mediate the positive effect of trait self-control on wellbeing; however, we formulate no hypothesis regarding the mediating effect of obsessive passion.

# MATERIALS AND METHODS

## Participants

Using an online crowdsourcing platform (ClickWorker+), we recruited 509 volunteers from the United States (326 females, 64%, and 183 males, 36%; Mage = 31.74, SDage = 11.05, from 18 to 70 years old; Msize = 1.63 m, SDsize = 0.19; Mweight = 82.09 kg, SDweight = 32.11) who reported being passionate about a specific activity (e.g., listening to music, playing video games, reading, photography, biking, cooking, fishing, swimming, blogging). On

average, the participants provided a score of 5.94 in passion (SD = 0.89). Based on the criterion provided by Philippe et al. (2009) considering that a mean equal to or above ""5"" (on a 7-point Likert scale) on the passion subscale (see the Section Measures below) would reflect a high level of passion-the present sample of participants might be considered as composed of passionate individuals. Additionally, the participants reported they had been practicing their passionate activity 5.16 times a week (SD = 1.81), during 21.30 min per day (SD = 61.24), and for 13.17 years (SD = 10.22). Lastly, this sample was heterogeneous on several qualitative variables, such as socio-demography (i.e., ethnicity, sex) and medical situation (i.e., chronic mental and physical disease; see Table 1).

## Study Design and Procedure

The present study was performed in line with the recommendations from Qatar University's Institutional Review Board. Before starting the study, the participants read information about the study. Specifically, they were told that the study was designed to examine relationships between passion and feelings, and they read the definition of passion proposed by Vallerand (2012) (see above). The participants were also told that (a) they had to have a passion for an activity to participate in the study, (b) they would respond to questions and their responses would be completely anonymous and confidential2, and (c) they would receive a compensation of US\$0.45 in exchange for their participation. When the participants accepted to take part in the study, they provided their informed written consent, reported basic information (e.g., socio-demography), and started answering questionnaires. After reporting their passionate activity, the participants completed the following scales, sequentially: (a) harmonious and obsessive passion, (b) general passion, (c) trait self-control, (d) hedonic wellbeing scales, and (e) eudaimonic wellbeing scales.

## Measures

The Passion Scale was composed of three subscales: Harmonious passion (6 items; e.g., ""My activity is in harmony with other activities in my life,"" a = 0.84), obsessive passion (6 items; e.g., ""I have difficulties controlling my urge to do my activity,"" a = 0.82), and general passion (4 items; e.g., ""This activity is a passion for me,"" α = 0.79; Vallerand et al., 2003). The questions were measured on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from ""Not agree at all"" (""1"") to ""Very strongly agree"" (""7""). Trait self-control was measured using the questionnaire developed by Tangney et al. (2004) (13 items; e.g., ""I am good at resisting temptation""; α = 0.87; ""1"" = ""Not at all,"" ""7"" = ""Very much so""). Wellbeing combined two concepts: hedonic and eudaimonic wellbeing. To assess hedonic wellbeing, we employed two scales: the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire (Hills and Argyle, 2002; 8 items; e.g., ""I am well-satisfied about everything in my life""; α = 0.76; ""1"" = ""Strongly disagree,"" ""6"" = ""Strongly agree"") and the Satisfaction with Life Scale (Diener et al., 1985; 5

items; e.g., ""The conditions of my life are excellent""; α = 0.90; ""1"" = ""Strongly disagree,"" ""7"" = ""Strongly agree""). To measure eudaimonic wellbeing, we employed two scales: The Subjective Vitality Scale3 (Bostic et al., 2000; 6 items; e.g., ""I feel alive and vital""; α = 0.92; ""1"" = ""Not at all,"" ""7"" = ""Very true"") and the Questionnaire of Eudaimonic Well-Being (Waterman et al., 2010; 22 items; e.g., ""I can say that I have found my purpose in life""; α = 0.87; ""0"" = ""Strongly disagree,"" ""4"" = ""Strongly agree"").

#### Analysis

Because the distributions of all the manifest variables were non-normal4 (Shapiro-Wilk test, ps ≤ 0.001), we used nonparametric tests: the Partial Least Square Structural Equation Method (PLS-SEM; for assessing the models quality via measurement and structural model analyses; bootstrapping = 1,000 resampling iterations) and Spearman's rho (for correlation analyses between the manifest variables).

## Measurement and Structural Models

A measurement model gathers several manifest and latent variables. When a latent variable is composed of more than one manifest variable, the quality of the latent variable can be assessed through one of the following benchmarks: (a) the first eigenvalue of the correlation matrix from the principal component analysis is larger than 1.000, whereas the other eigenvalues are lower than 1.000; (b) the internal consistency index (Cronbach's alpha) is higher than 0.700; or (c) the composite reliability index of the latent variables (Dillon-Goldstein's rho) is higher than 0.700 (e.g., Vinzi et al., 2010). Preliminary analyses indicated that ""wellbeing""

<sup>2</sup> The researcher had no contact with the participants and had not received any personal information about them from the team of the crowdsourcing online platform.

<sup>3</sup> The Subjective Vitality Scale refers to a revised version of the vitality scale developed by Ryan and Frederick (1997).

<sup>4</sup>This supports Astrachan et al.'s (2014) view regarding the non-normality of distributions in social sciences, and this explains why we chose PLS-SEM (XLSTAT-PLS, Addinsoft, version 2016.06.37018) over CB-SEM (e.g., AMOS) for computing our SEM analyses.

 appeared to be an effective latent variable of all wellbeing-related constructs used in this study (i.e., happiness, satisfaction with life, subjective vitality, and eudaimonic wellbeing; see Table 2). The PLS model yielded standardized path coefficients [estimated through ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions], indicating the strength of causal relationships (see Table 4).

## Assessment of Model Quality

The goodness-of-fit (GoF) indexes and the coefficient of determination of endogenous latent variables, R2, assessed the model quality (e.g., Tenenhaus et al., 2005; Henseler et al., 2009). The GoF indexes enabled us to assess the measurement model quality (i.e., outer model GoF index), the structural model quality (i.e., inner model GoF index), or both (i.e., absolute and relative GoF indexes). A GoF index can vary from ""0"" (i.e., rejection of the model) to ""1"" (i.e., validation of the model). The critical value for the indexes of relative GoF, outer model GoF, and inner model GoF is 0.900-said differently, if the GoF score is equal to or larger than 0.900-then the model quality is considered as acceptable. Moreover, the critical values for the absolute GoF are 0.010 (small quality), 0.250 (moderate quality), and 0.360 (large quality; e.g., Tenenhaus et al., 2005; Vinzi et al., 2010). Furthermore, R2 represents a measure of fitness, and when a R2 was significant the model's quality was acceptable.

## Mediations

A significant mediation can be reported when all of the following conditions are satisfied. Firstly, we must observe a direct and significant relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable (excluding the interaction of the mediator). Secondly, we must observe significant relationships between the independent variable and the mediator, and between the mediator and the dependent variable. Thirdly, we must observe significant indirect and total effects (including the interaction of the mediator). Fourthly, the size and strength of the mediation, estimated through the value of the variance accounted for (VAF), must be equal to or higher than 20% (Hair et al., 2014; see Table 5). More specifically, a VAF score larger than 80% indicates the mediation is full, while a VAF score equal to or larger than 20% and equal to or lower than 80% indicates the mediation is partial. Notwithstanding, when the VAF score is lower than 20%, one should "" ... conclude that (almost) no mediation takes place"" (Hair et al., 2014, p. 225; see Table 5).

# RESULTS

## Preliminary Analyses

The analyses revealed that both models were significant (model 1: absolute GoF = 0.366, relative GoF = 0.971, outer model GoF = 0.997, inner model GoF = 0.973, R2 = 18.300%, p < 0.001; model 2: absolute GoF = 0.298; relative GoF = 0.980; outer model GoF=0.997; inner model GoF=0.982; R2 = 12.111%, p < 0.001; see Figure 1).

#### Main Analyses Correlations

Correlations revealed positive relationships between harmonious passion, trait self-control, and the four forms of wellbeing (ps = 0.225 to 0.427, ps < 0.001), and no relationships of obsessive passion with the other variables (ps = - 0.044 to 0.008, ps > 0.05; see Table 3). The four wellbeing-related constructs were positively associated with each other (ps = 0.523 to 0.732, ps < 0.001; see Table 3).

## Model 1: Paths and Mediations

The analyses revealed that (a) harmonious passion positively predicted trait self-control (ß = 0.225, p < 0.001) and wellbeing (ß = 0.250, p < 0.001), (b) trait self-control positively predicted wellbeing (ß = 0.448, p < 0.001), and (c) obsessive passion did not predict trait self-control (ß = - 0.074, p > 0.05) and wellbeing (ß = 0.014, p > 0.05; see Table 4 and Figure 1A). Furthermore, trait self-control appeared to significantly mediate the relationship between harmonious passion and wellbeing (partial mediation: the direct, indirect, and total effects were significant, VAF = 33.136%), but did not mediate the relationship between obsessive passion and wellbeing (the direct, indirect, and total effects were not significant; see Tables 4, 5).

## Model 2: Paths and Mediations

The analyses revealed that (a) trait self-control positively predicted harmonious passion (ß = 0.224, p < 0.001) and wellbeing (ß = 0.448, p < 0.001), (b) trait self-control did not predict obsessive passion (ß = 0.052, p > 0.05), and (c) harmonious passion positively predicted wellbeing (ß = 0.225, p < 0.001), whereas obsessive passion did not predict wellbeing (ß = 0.014, p > 0.05; see Table 4 and Figure 1B). The mediating effect of harmonious passion appeared to be significant (the indirect effect was significant, p < 0.001), but the VAF value was lower than 20% (VAF = 11.144%; see Tables 4, 5). No mediating effect of obsessive passion was found (see Tables 4, 5).

## DISCUSSION

Using different frameworks, such as the dualistic model of passion and the neo-socioanalytic theory, the present study sought to examine the interrelationships between passion, trait self-control, and wellbeing, as well as two models designed to predict wellbeing. In model 1, we examined the relationships between passion and wellbeing, with trait self-control as an intermediate construct. In model 2, we proposed that the dispositional construct (i.e., trait self-control) could predict

wellbeing, with passion for an activity as a midlevel construct. Then, we examined whether trait self-control could mediate the effect of passion on wellbeing (model 1), and whether passion could be considered as another mediator of interest for accounting for the relationship between trait self-control and wellbeing (model 2).

## Relationships between Passion, Trait Self-Control, and Wellbeing

The results revealed that harmonious passion was positively related to wellbeing, whereas obsessive passion was unrelated to that variable (see Table 3). This supports the view that harmonious passion can promote wellbeing (e.g., Vallerand, 2012, 2015), as well as previous studies showing that harmonious passion was positively related to wellbeing, whereas obsessive passion was either negatively related or unrelated to wellbeing (e.g., Vallerand et al., 2007, 2008; Carpentier et al., 2012). According to the dualistic model of passion, harmoniously passionate people would be more likely to report high levels of wellbeing compared to obsessively passionate people, because harmonious (obsessive) passion results from an autonomous (controlled) internalization of the passionate activity into

the self, resulting from the satisfaction (dissatisfaction) of psychological innate needs. When harmonious passion is developed, people would experience a sense of control over their activity and willingly embrace other activities, resulting in the experience of positive emotions and wellbeing. Additionally, such a functioning may lead to peak experiences, such as flow (Carpentier et al., 2012). Following this perspective, one might suggest that harmonious passion might also precipitate experiences of psychological momentum (i.e., states of energization and impetus initiating a trajectory of performance outcomes; Iso-Ahola and Dotson, 2016; Briki, 2017).

The results also revealed that trait self-control was positively related to wellbeing (see Table 3), supporting previous studies displaying positive associations between trait self-control and wellbeing (e.g., Cheung et al., 2014; Briki et al., 2015; Briki, 2016). The authors proposed that trait self-control would promote wellbeing by fostering effective strategies and positive emotions (Cheung et al., 2014; De Ridder and Gillebaart, 2016), and such emotions would result from the capability of trait self-control to manage conflicting desires, facilitate task completion, and foster success experiences (Hofmann et al., 2012, 2014; Hagger, 2013, 2014; De Ridder and Gillebaart, 2016). The results also revealed that trait selfcontrol was positively related (or unrelated) to harmonious (or obsessive) passion (see Table 3). These results support those of previous studies that reported (a) positive associations between trait self-control and autonomous functioning (Briki et al., 2015; Briki, 2016) and (b) no association between trait self-control and controlled functioning (Briki et al., 2015).

context whereby trait self-control could grow, and such a growth was supposed to be responsible for wellbeing enhancement. Interestingly, this model echoes the social investment principle, which posits that committing to social institutions (e.g., work, marriage, family) induces personality development because endorsing valued social roles (e.g., a university professor) would lead to adopting specific goals (e.g., obtaining a promotion), incorporating specific norms and expectations (e.g., dominance, agreeableness, conscientiousness, abnegation), and modifying one's identities (Roberts and Wood, 2006). Grounded in the neosocioanalytic approach (e.g., Bogg et al., 2008), model 2 proposed an organization arranging the different variables from a toplevel construct of the self (i.e., trait self-control) to a low-level affect construct (i.e., positive emotions and feelings), with a midlevel exercise identity construct (i.e., passion for an activity). The results indicated that models 1 and 2 were both significant, thus supporting our predictions and validating the two approaches used in the present study.

In model 1, the results showed that harmonious passion positively predicted trait self-control and wellbeing (see Table 4 and Figure 1A). This result can be explained by the fact that self-relevant activities would promote goal selection and

reprioritization processes (Carver and Scheier, 1998; Carver, 2015), thus echoing Carpentier et al.'s (2012) study showing that harmonious passion promoted adaptive cognitive responses (e.g., deep state of concentration in the task). Moreover, the mediation analyses revealed that trait self-control partially mediated the relationship between harmonious passion and wellbeing (see Table 5), supporting previous studies showing that trait selfcontrol partially mediated the positive influence of autonomous motivation on wellbeing (Briki et al., 2015; Briki, 2016). Hence, our result enriches the predictions of the dualistic model of passion by suggesting that harmonious passion can foster agreeable affective experiences and wellbeing via increasing the effectiveness of self-regulatory processes.

The results also showed that trait self-control did not mediate the relationship between obsessive passion and wellbeing (see Table 5), and obsessive passion neither predicted trait selfcontrol nor wellbeing. One can explain these results by the fact that controlled regulation driving obsessive passion would prevent the activation of facilitative cognitive processes (e.g., long-term goal selection), which are well-known to help make progress toward desired goals and experience positive emotions. The dualistic model of passion indicates that obsessive passion

makes people suffer from living under the control of their favorite activities, preventing them from considering and using time-outs as fruittul opportunities to energize themselves and have fun (e.g., performing a physical exercise session with one's children).

In model 2, the results revealed that obsessive passion neither predicted trait self-control and wellbeing nor mediated the positive effect of trait self-control on wellbeing, supporting the view that obsessive passion represents a maladaptive (or, at least, a non-adaptive) construct. In contrast, the results indicated that harmonious passion mediated the relationship between trait self-control and wellbeing (the indirect effect was significant); however, the size of the mediating effect indicated that (almost) no mediation would take place (VAF = 11.144%). Therefore, one can suggest that the beneficial effect of trait self-control on wellbeing would be essentially due to the intervention of selfregulatory mechanisms (De Ridder and Gillebaart, 2016), but that harmonious passion may also account for such a relationship. Indeed, this result incites the pursuit of an investigation regarding the potential mediating effect of harmonious passion. Finally, our results support DeYoung's (2015) view "" ... that the highest and most enduring levels of well-being should be achieved when one's characteristic adaptations are not only well-adapted to one's particular life circumstances, but also well-integrated-that is, minimally conflicting with each other, with one's traits, and with innate needs"" (p. 53).

## CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVES

 The present study is the first to examine the relationships between passion, trait self-control, and wellbeing, and supports the view that trait self-control and harmonious passion represent not only adaptive and powerful constructs, but also key determinants of wellbeing (e.g., Tangney et al., 2004; Bogg, 2016; Verner-Filion et al., 2017). However, this study is not without limitations. Firstly, it was correlational; hence, future investigations should employ stronger (experimental) causal designs. We suggest that future research might be directed toward examining the effects of intervention programs designed to promote harmonious passion on trait self-control and wellbeing. Secondly, as for any self-report measure-based investigations, social desirability biases might have produced contamination of affective responses, resulting from cognitive reasoning and judgments. Nonetheless, by informing the participants about the anonymous and confidential nature of this study, the methodology of this investigation attempted to limit such biases.

This study also brought evidence that the two models were effective for predicting wellbeing. As a result, different studies could take place within each of the models. Following the perspective of model 1, further studies should examine the effects of autonomy-supportive (vs. controlling) contexts or, more generally, the effects of autonomy/controlling-related cues on the development of trait self-control and wellbeing over several weeks. In line with the perspective proposed by

model 2, one could examine whether people who have more trait self-control would develop higher levels of harmonious passion and wellbeing. Moreover, combining both perspectives, we believe that time-based studies exploring the interdependence between personality and health may contribute to a better understanding of wellbeing (Bogg, 2016). Indeed, if we consider that passion, trait self-control and wellbeing may fluctuate over time and display non-linear relationships, then employing a longitudinal approach could help examine the reciprocal effects between harmonious passion and trait self-control for predicting wellbeing. Further studies should measure the needs satisfaction underlying the development of passion (Verner-Filion et al., 2017), since research has found that autonomous functioning could be shaped differently according to cultural and societal characteristics, such as self-construal (e.g., independent and interdependent feature) and social rank (Walker et al., 2011; Walker, 2016). Following such a perspective, future studies should examine the links between needs satisfaction, harmonious passion, trait self-control, and wellbeing.

From an applied standpoint, this study invites to tackle obesity and cardiovascular diseases in response to physical inactivity by promoting harmonious passion for exercise among the general population. Parents, teachers, managers, coaches, and psychologists should pay attention to people's perceptions of autonomy, relatedness, and competence. Considering people as valuable human beings (and not as means to attaining goals), offering them the opportunity to choose, involving them in the decision-making process, truly listening to and supporting them while facing challenges and difficulties, offering the chance to acquire new skills, etc., might develop these perceptions. We speculate that repeating such supportive behaviors over time should contribute to promoting a positive internalization of the given activity (e.g., work, physical exercise) into the self, thereby promoting harmonious passion, trait self-control, and wellbeing.

# Abstract

 Poor sleep quality has been repeatedly linked to the entire psychosis continuum, including psychotic-like experiences (PLEs); however, sleep dysfunction is a component of several other psychopathologies that have also been linked to increased risk for PLEs, including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It has yet to be examined if PLEs are a significant risk factor for poor sleep quality or if this sleep dysfunction is better accounted for by comorbid psychopathology. In 2,687 undergraduates, PLEs were evaluated using the positive items of the Prodromal Questionnaire. Symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD were also assessed, as was sleep quality. Mediation analysis using PROCESS was conducted to determine if poor sleep quality associated with PLEs was in fact more associated with symptoms of other psychopathologies. Symptoms of depression and PTSD mediated the relationship between PLEs and sleep quality, though anxiety symptoms did not. These findings suggest that treating symptoms of depression and PTSD may improve multiple domains of psychotic illness.

Sleep Quality, Psychological Symptoms, and Psychotic-like Experiences

Poor sleep quality has been repeatedly linked to the entire psychosis continuum: in individuals with schizophrenia (Cohrs, 2008), in those at clinical high risk for developing psychotic disorders (Lunsford-Avery et al., 2013), and in individuals experiencing psychotic-like experiences (PLEs; subthreshold, attenuated versions of psychotic symptoms; Andorko et al., 2017; Lee, Cho, Cho, Jang, & Kim, 2012; Oh et al., 2016). Sleep disturbances occur in 30-80% of people with schizophrenia, have been strongly associated with increases in both positive and negative symptom severity (Cohrs, 2008), and often precede relapse of psychotic episodes (Benson, 2008). People with schizophrenia demonstrate impairments in quality, continuity, efficacy, and duration of sleep, above and beyond the effects of medications (Chouinard, Poulin, Stip, & Godbout, 2004). Individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia report trouble falling asleep, early awakening, and display decreased slow-wave sleep, which is considered the most restorative stage of sleep (Hofstetter, Lysaker, & Mayeda, 2005), and often spend more time in bed attempting to sleep than non-psychiatric controls (Royuela et al., 2002). These sleep disruptions are associated with significant distress and decreases in quality of life across phases of the disorder (Hofstetter et al., 2005; Lunsford-Avery et al., 2013). Additionally, disturbances in sleep patterns precede the onset of psychotic disorders, with individuals at clinical high risk for developing psychosis showing increased latency of onset of sleep and greater difficulty staying asleep when compared to their peers (Lunsford-Avery et al., 2013). In a recent study, PLEs were significantly associated with fragmented sleep, increased night anxiety, and presence of sleep hallucinations, and initial insomnia was predicted by distress associated with PLEs (Andorko et al., 2017).

Although sleep dysfunction has been associated with the course of psychosis, it is also present in and contributes to diagnostic criteria for numerous disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), depressive disorders such as major depression, and trauma-related disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD; APA, 2013). Many individuals who exhibit symptoms along the psychosis continuum experience comorbidities such as an anxiety disorder and/or a depressive disorder and are more likely to have experienced traumatic life events in childhood (Addington & Heinssen, 2012; APA, 2013). A study using National Comorbidity Survey Replication data (Oh et al., 2016) explored the relation between psychotic experiences and sleep quality while controlling for comorbid diagnoses. They found that in a large sample of adults in the United States only two types of sleep disruption were still significant for predicting psychotic experiences when controlling for comorbid diagnoses: difficulty falling asleep and early morning awakenings (Oh et al., 2016). However, by looking only at comorbid diagnoses the authors were unable to examine subclinical symptoms of anxiety, depression, and/or PTSD, which have all been previously found to be significantly higher not only in individuals experiencing psychotic symptoms but also in those with PLEs (Gibson et al., 2014; Reeves et al., 2014). Examining subthreshold symptoms of psychopathology along with symptoms at a clinically significant level allows for a better understanding of the influence of other psychopathologies on the relationship between sleep quality and PLEs. Similarly, PLEs and clinical psychosis have highly overlapping risk factors (van Os & Linscott, 2012), and examining subthreshold psychotic-like experiences, rather than full psychotic symptoms, allows for investigation of psychotic processes in larger, non-help-seeking samples and serves to disentangle psychosis-risk factors from disease or medication-related processes later in the course of the disorder.

In order to more fully understand the relation between PLEs and other psychopathological symptoms on sleep quality, it is important to examine a range of symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD, rather than solely examine clinically diagnosed forms of these disorders, as well as the mediating effects of each of these constructs. This study examined the indirect effects of anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms on the relation between PLEs and sleep quality in order to determine whether poor sleep quality is related primarily to PLEs, or if a greater degree of the variance is accounted for by the presence of commonly co-morbid symptoms of other psychopathologies (anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms). We hypothesized that symptoms of other psychopathologies- anxiety, depression, and PTSDwould mediate the relation between PLEs and sleep quality.

# Material and Methods

## Participants

Participants consisted of 2,687 undergraduate students at Temple University who were recruited from an online subject pool as a requirement from various interdisciplinary courses (see Table 1 for demographic characteristics). Questionnaires were completed at a computer terminal in the laboratory, with lab staff available to provide instruction and answer questions. The study was approved by the university's Institutional Review Board and all participants provided informed consent.

## Instruments

PLEs were evaluated using the positive-item subscale (45 items) of the full length, 92item Prodromal Questionnaire (PQ; Loewy, Johnson, & Cannon, 2007). Individuals were asked whether they have experienced symptoms (while not under the influence of drugs, alcohol, or medications) within the last month. The variable of interest was the total number of positive

items endorsed. The PQ has been validated against the Structured Interview for Psychosis-Risk Syndromes (SIPS) in predicting psychosis risk syndromes with 90% sensitivity and 49% specificity (Loewy, Bearden, Johnson, Raine, & Cannon, 2005; Loewy et al., 2007).

Quality of sleep was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI; Buysse, Reynolds, Monk, Berman, & Kupfer, 1989). This 19-item scale assesses sleep quality over the past month, including subjective sleep quality, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medications, and daytime dysfunction. This scale has demonstrated 89.6% sensitivity and 86.5% specificity at distinguishing between ""good"" and ""poor"" sleepers (Buysse et al., 1989) and has shown convergent validity with clinical and physiological measures of sleep (Buysse et al., 2008). The global score was used, which reflects overall sleep quality with higher scores representing lower quality of sleep.

Depression symptoms were measured by the brief version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D), which assesses presence and severity of depressive symptoms over the past week (Radloff, 1977). This scale has been found to be reliable and valid across samples (Radloff, 1977; Roberts, 1980; Roberts, Vernon, & Rhoades, 1989). Scores range from 0-30, with scores greater than or equal to 10 representing significant depressive symptoms (Andresen, Malmgren, Carter, & Patrick, 1994).

Trait generalized anxiety symptoms were assessed with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Trait Form, Anxiety Subscale (STAI; Spielberger, 1983); this version excludes items that load predominantly onto the depression factor (Bieling, Antony, & Swinson, 1998; Spielberger, 1983). The STAI has good construct validity (Smeets, Merckelbach, & Griez, 1997), discriminant and convergent validity (Spielberger, 1983), and test-retest reliability (Rule & Traver, 1983). The 7-item scale asks participants to rate how frequently they experience an

anxiety symptom. Total scores range from 7 to 28, and individuals with anxiety disorders generally scoring greater than or equal to 16 (Bieling et al., 1998).

PTSD symptoms were measured by the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C; Conybeare, Behar, Solomon, Newman, & Borkovec, 2012). This 17-item checklist assessed the presence of PTSD symptoms as well as the distress level that these symptoms cause. The scale has been found to have strong validity and reliability (McDonald & Calhoun, 2010).

# Data Analysis

Prior to mediation analyses, the dependent variable (sleep quality) was examined for normality by examining skewness and kurtosis values and by visually inspecting the data. Next, bivariate analyses using Pearson's correlations were conducted to determine whether there were significant relationships between the main independent variable (PLEs) and potential mediators (anxiety, depression, PTSD) and the dependent variable (sleep quality), as well as if the potential mediators (anxiety, depression, PTSD) were associated with the dependent variable (sleep quality; Baron & Kenny, 1986). Only variables that met both conditions were examined in the mediation model. Additionally, age and gender were tested as potential covariates by determining if they were associated with the independent and dependent variables (PLEs and sleep quality, respectively). Hayes' PROCESS macro for SPSS (Hayes, 2012) was used to test for multiple mediation. The indirect effect was tested using a bootstrap estimation approach with 5,000 samples. Significant mediation was determined by the 95% confidence interval not including zero (Preacher & Hayes, 2008).

#### Results

Sleep quality was found to be normally distributed within the sample. Bivariate correlations were significant for number of PLEs endorsed and sleep quality (r=.28, p< . 01), as
well as with all potential mediating variables: number of symptoms of depression (r= .20, p< .01), anxiety (r= .54, p< .01), and PTSD (r= .58, p< .01). Sleep quality was significantly correlated with all mediators including depression (r= .39, p< .01), anxiety (r= .31, p< . 01), and PTSD (r= . 41, p< . 01).

Table 1 presents the demographic characteristics of the sample. Significant gender differences were found for PLEs [t(2683)= 4.14, p< . 01], sleep quality [t(2640)= 2.58, p= . 01], and PTSD symptoms [t(2676)= 2.27, p= .02], and approached significance for anxiety symptoms [f(2680)= 1.95, p= . 052], with men experiencing a greater number of PLEs, better quality sleep, fewer PTSD symptoms, and slightly fewer anxiety symptoms than women. There were no significant differences in depression symptoms by gender [(2682)= 1.21, p= .23]. Age was significantly related to PLEs (r= -. 05, p= . 01) and anxiety symptoms (r= -. 06, p< . 01), but no other variables of interest (p= . 12-.37); thus, to take a conservative approach, age and gender were controlled for in subsequent analyses.

As Table 2 demonstrates, indirect bootstrapping results indicated that depression symptoms and PTSD symptoms individually mediated the relation between PLEs and sleep quality, as did the total model was significant when controlling for covariates, as well as without this adjustment [CI= .5956 - . 7371 without age and gender covariates]. Anxiety symptoms were not a significant mediator. The relation between PLEs and sleep quality was no longer significant after adding all three mediators into the model (p= .12).

## Discussion

This is the first study, to our knowledge, to demonstrate that symptoms of depression and PTSD mediate the association between greater PLEs and higher levels of sleep disturbances. The significant multiple mediation model, as well as loss of the direct effect of PLEs on sleep quality

after accounting for mediating variables, indicates that, although PLEs and sleep quality are related, this relation is perhaps better explained by other symptoms of psychopathology (i.e., depression and PTSD) that are commonly comorbid with PLEs.

Sleep dysfunction is related to the other types of psychopathology examined, including symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD. Insomnia/hypersomnia are part of the diagnostic criteria for depressive disorders, and trauma-related disorders are characterized, in part, by persistent nightmares related to the traumatic events (APA, 2013). Future studies may seek to further investigate these overlapping dimensions, as well as their relationship to PLEs. Additionally, the majority of people who report insomnia in sleep laboratories and epidemiological studies have primary diagnoses of GAD, and GAD symptoms tend to precede the onset of insomnia (Monti & Monti, 2000). In these cases, insomnia related to GAD was significantly reduced both by targeting GAD symptoms through psychological treatments (including both psychodynamic approaches and cognitive behavioral therapy) as well as pharmacological approaches using benzodiazepines (Monti, 2000). The use of melatonin has been found to be successful at treating insomnia related to depression (Dolberg, Hirschmann, & Grunhaus, 1998) and chronic schizophrenia (Shamir et al., 2000), though in both studies, symptoms of psychopathology were not improved despite improvements in sleep quality. Both typical and atypical antipsychotics have been shown to improve sleep quality and psychotic symptoms in people with schizophrenia (Monti, 2004). These findings suggest that treatments targeting depression and PTSD symptoms in psychosis samples may serve to improve multiple domains of the disorder.

This study utilized a large, non-help-seeking undergraduate sample, though this sample may not generalize to a non-college population. It should be noted that this sample was

composed of undergraduates, though the university from which they were recruited is demographically and socioeconomically diverse. An additional limitation is the cross-sectional nature of the study. Furthermore, our self-report questionnaires rely heavily on retrospection. This is of particularly relevance to the PQ, as this sample may contain more false-positives than clinical high-risk studies, where individuals are often already experiencing some amount of symptom distress, causing them to seek mental health services. Future studies may employ a longitudinal design to better elucidate how sleep quality, PLEs, and symptoms of other psychopathologies interact over time.

Though sleep quality has long been associated with positive psychotic symptoms across the course of illness, our findings indicate that previous results may in fact function through other types of psychopathologies, which in turn also influence sleep. By treating underlying psychopathologies, such as PTSD symptoms and depression, in addition to the resulting sleep disruptions, clinicians may be able to provide individuals with better outcomes that have the potential to influence sleep and psychological symptoms.

Kevwords: Childhood maltreatment Non-medical use of prescription drugs Adolescents Depressive symptoms Mediation effects

### A B S T R A C T

Background: Childhood maltreatment might increase the risk of subsequent drug use behavior, and depressive symptoms have been reported to be associated both childhood maltreatment and non-medical use of prescription drugs (NMUPD). This large-scale study aimed to test the mediating effects of depressive symptoms on the association of childhood maltreatment with NMUPD among Chinese adolescents.

Methods: A secondary analysis of the cross-sectional data collected from 7th to 12th graders who were sampled using a multistage, stratified cluster, random sampling method in the 2015 School-based Chinese Adolescents Health Survey. There were 24,457 students who were invited to participate and 23,039 students' questionnaires were completed and qualified for our survey (response rate: 94.2%).

Results: In the adjusted models without mediation, the results students who reported that they had experienced emotional abuse were at a higher risk of past year use and past month use of opioids (past year: Adjusted OR [AOR] = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.05–1.10; past month: AOR = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.06–1.10) and sedatives (past year: AOR = 1.06, 95% CI = 1.03-1.08; past month: AOR = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.13-1.16). The results of mediation analyses demonstrated that there were significant standardized indirect effects of emotional abuse on opioids use and sedatives use through depressive symptoms, respectively (P < 0.001).

Limitations: Our study sample only included school inference could not be examined due to the cross-sectional design.

Conclusions: Depressive symptoms play a significant mediator role on the association of childhood maltreatment with NMUPD. Interventions targeted at adolescents who are involved in NMUPD should pay attention to their histories of childhood maltreatment.

### 1. Introduction

The growing non-medical use of prescription drugs (NMUPD) has been a global health concern (Novak et al., 2011). NMUPD is defined as taking medications without a doctor's prescription or solely for the feeling or experience caused by the drug (United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, 2011). Adolescence is the period of transition between puberty and adulthood, and is often characterized as a stage of increased imitation and exploration along with a range of health-risky behaviors (e.g., drug use) (Crockett and Beal, 2012). During this period, individuals may be responsible for their own medication management and especially vulnerable to the damaging effects of drug use for their sill developing brains (Casey et al., 2008). According to the 2014 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), prescription drugs were the second most popular drug among adolescents in the United States, and 655,000 adolescents aged 12-17 years admitted NMUPD (Hedden et al., 2015). Our previous study also indicated that NMUPD was prevalent among Chinese adolescents, and the total lifetime prevalence of non-medical use of prescription pain relievers was 11.3% (Guo et al., 2015).

Childhood maltreatment is the abuse and neglect that occurs to children under 18 years of age, including all types of physical and emotional neglect/abuse and sexual abuse. Previous studies demonstrated that childhood maltreatment can not only have long-lasting effects on psychological and social functioning, development or dignity into adulthood, but also place heavy financial burden (e.g., lower

incomes, higher health care costs, and disability-adjusted life years [DALYs] lost) on individuals and society resulting directly or indirectly from the aforementioned loss of psychological and social functioning (e.g., impaired capacity of adults to generate income, lower level of academic achievement, and reduced health-related quality of life) (Fang et al., 2015; World Health Organization, 1999, 2006). A history of childhood maltreatment is reported to be related to elevated risks of serious behavior problems, including internalizing (e.g., mental health) and externalizing (e.g., drug use) behaviors (Afifi et al., 2012; Al et al., 2013; Child Welfare Information Gateway, 2013). A diathesis-stress model using the psychological theory has been promoted to illustrate that early stressful events may result in a lot of health-risky behaviors among individuals with vulnerability diathesis, and exposure to stressors early in life and accumulation of stress (chronicity) could have long-lasting and adverse effects on the development of brain systems involved in learning, motivation, and stress-related adaptive behaviors (such as NMUPD) (Reinelt et al., 2013). Moreover, our previous study also found that maltreatment while a child is related to an increased risk of NMUPD among Chinese adolescents (Guo et al., 2017). Although some evidence suggests an association between NMUPD and a history of adverse life events, there is a dearth of study addressing the potential associations between each specific type of childhood maltreatment and NMUPD among general adolescents.

Depressive symptoms or depression is one of the mental health problems. A previous longitudinal study demonstrated that adolescents with greater childhood emotional abuse severity experienced higher increases in depressive symptoms (Shapero et al., 2014), a prior crosssectional study indicated sexual abuse were significantly associated with depressive symptoms in adults (Schalinski et al., 2016), and a systematic review also showed a significant association between physical abuse experiences and adulthood depressive symptoms among women (Al-Modallal et al., 2008). Moreover, it has also been reported that the associations between NMUPD and depressive symptoms are statistically significant (Guo et al., 2016a, 2016b, 2016c; Sundbom and Bingefors, 2013; Zullig and Divin, 2012). Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that depressive symptoms may play a mediator role on the associations between childhood maltreatment and NMUPD, but no study has examined these mediating effects before. We thus conducted this large-scale study to test the mediating effects of depressive symptoms on the association of childhood maltreatment with non-medical use of prescription drugs among Chinese adolescents.

#### 2. Methods

### 2.1. Sample and procedure

The present study analyzed the cross-sectional data collected in the 2015 School-based Chinese Adolescents Health Survey (SCAHS), (Guo et al., 2016a, 2016b, 2016c), as it was the most recent version at the time of analysis and added additional questions about childhood maltreatment. SCAHS is an ongoing study of the health-related behaviors among Chinese adolescents (7th to 12th grade), and collects large-scale cross-sectional data (conducted every two years since 2007) (Guo et al., 2016a, 2016b, 2016c, 2015; Wang et al., 2014) and longitudinal data (between 2009 and 2012) (Guo et al., 2016c) via questionnaires administered in classrooms. The current study used secondary data from 7th and 12th graders who were sampled using a multistage, stratified cluster, random sampling method in the 2015 SCAHS. The procedures for data collection have been described in detail elsewhere (Guo et al., 2017). Briefly, in stage 1, we divided China into three economic stratifications by gross domestic product (GDP) per capita (high-level, middle-level, and low-level), and then randomly selected two representative cities from each stratification. In stage 2, two junior high schools, two senior high schools, and two vocational high schools were randomly selected from each representative city. In stage 3, two classes were randomly selected from each grade within the selected schools. All

available students in the selected classes were invited to voluntarily participate in our study. There were 24,457 students who were invited to participate and 23,039 students' questionnaires were completed and qualified for our survey (response rate: 94.2%). The study was approved by the Sun Yat-Sen University School of Public Health Institutional Review Board. To protect the privacy of the students, the anonymity of the self-reported questionnaires was guaranteed, and the questionnaires were administered by research assistants in the classrooms without the presence of teachers (to avoid any potential information bias).

### 2.2. Measures

#### 2.2.1. Non-medical use of prescription drugs

In this study, the two measures of NMUPD included non-medical use of opioids and sedatives. Non-medical use of opioids or sedatives was assessed by the following questions: ""Have you ever/how many times in the past 12 months/how many times in the past 30 days have you used the following prescription drugs for a non-medical purpose?"" The responses to these questions were used to create the corresponding variable of NMUPD status which was grouped into 4 categories: nonuser (0 = never use), lifetime non-medical use (1 = have used prescription drugs non-medically but not in the past 12 months or in the past 30 days), non-medical use in the past 12 months (2 = have been involved in NMUPD in the past 12 months but not in the past 30 days), and non-medical use in the past 30 days (3 = have used prescription drugs non-medically in the past 30 days); the category ""non-user"" was treated as reference group in multinomial logistic regression analyses.

The list of prescription drugs was developed with a focus on medications that were reported to be used widely by adolescent drug abusers in rehabilitation centers of China. Opioids included compounded cough syrup with codeine (codeine), compounded liquorice tablets (opium), tramadol hydrochloride, and diphenoxylate. Sedatives included compounded aminopyrine phenacetin tablets (barbiturates), diazepam or triazolam (benzodiazepines), and scopolamine hydrobromide tablets (barbiturates).

### 2.2.2. Childhood maltreatment

A history of childhood maltreatment was assessed using the short form of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (the CTQ-SF) in Chinese, (Bernstein et al., 1997; Bernstein et al., 2003); the Chinese version of the CTQ-SF has also been validated by Zhao et al. (2005), and exhibits good test-retest reliability over a 2 month interval (ICC = 0.88) and high internal consistency (the total Cronbach's alpha = 0.77) in Chinese adolescents (Zhao et al., 2005). Five subscales of the CTQ-SF assess different types of childhood maltreatment including physical abuse, emotional abuse, sexual abuse, physical neglect, and emotional neglect. Each subscale was based on five questions about experiences that occurred in childhood, with the answers given on a 5-point scale as follows: 1 = never, 2 = rarely, 3 = sometimes, 4 = often, and 5 = very often. Each of the 5 CTQ subscale scores ranged from 5 to 25, and higher scores indicated more severe maltreatment.

### 2.2.3. Mediators

Depressive symptoms were measured with the Chinese version of the Center for Epidemiology Scale for Depression (CES-D), which was translated into Mandarin Chinese to better reflect the meaning of the original items in the CES-D; the Chinese version of this scale has been validated and extensively utilized in Chinese studies (Cheng et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2008), and exhibits a satisfactory reliability (the total Cronbach's alpha = 0.88) in Chinese adolescents (Zhi-yan et al., 2009). The respondents were asked to rate the frequency of 20 symptoms of depression by choosing one of four response options that ranged from 'rarely or none of the time' to 'most or all of the time'. Higher scores were indicative of more severe depressive symptomatology, with a maximum score of 60 (Radloff, 1991).

### 2.2.4. Covariates

Factors that have been reported to be associated with NMUPD or childhood maltreatment were taken into account (Guo et al., 2017; Roy et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2014; Zullig and Divin, 2012). Alcohol drinking was measured by a single item ('have you used at least one drink during your lifetime?'). Smoking was assessed by asking the respondents the following question: 'have you smoked at least one cigarette during your lifetime?'

Demographic variables included age, gender (1 = male, 2 = female), living arrangement, household socioeconomic status (HSS), classmate relations, and relationships with teachers. Living arrangement was assessed by asking who lived in the student's primary home (responses were coded as living with both parents = 1, living with a single parent = 2, living with others = 3). HSS was measured by asking about the student's perceptions of his or her household's current socioeconomic status (responses were coded as excellent or very good = 1, good = 2, and fair or poor = 3). Classmate relations and relationships with teachers were assessed based on the student's self-rating about their relationships with classmates and teachers (responses were coded as good = 1, average = 2, and poor = 3).

### 2.3. Statistical analysis

First, descriptive analyses stratified by NMUPD were used to describe the sample characteristics. Second, multinomial logistic regression models were weighted to account for the complex survey design, including a correction for oversampling and unequal probability of selection as well as post-stratification weight to be nationally representative based on socio-demographics (gender and grade) obtained from the China Statistical Yearbook (2013). For the outcome with low event rate, multinomial logistic regression models utilized Firth's penalized likelihood approach. Third, the interactions between childhood maltreatment and depressive symptoms were tested using multinomial logistic regression models before the mediation analyses. Structural equation modeling (SEM) models using the maximum likelihood (ML) method were conducted to measure the mediating effects of depressive symptoms on the association between childhood maltreatment and NMUPD. There are several commonly applied model fit indices recommended to evaluate the models: the comparative fit index (CFI > 0.90 indicates good fit), the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA < 0.08 indicates acceptable fit), and the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR < 0.08 indicates goof fit) (Garver and Mentzer, 1999). As the variable of depressive symptoms and each type of childhood maltreatment were continuous, and the measures of NMUPD were categorized; standardized probit coefficients, standardized indirect effects, and standardized total effects were reported, and the bias-corrected 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using 1000 bootstrap samples. Observations with missing data were eliminated in the multinomial logistic regression models and SEM models (less than 1.61%) (Gunzler et al., 2013; Preacher and Hayes, 2008). All statistical tests were two-sided, and a P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

### 3. Results

### 3.1. Sample characteristics stratified by NMUPD

The sample characteristics are shown in Table 1. Of 23,039 eligible participants, 49.8% were male. The mean (SD) CTO scores of physical abuse, emotional abuse, sexual abuse, physical neglect, and emotional neglect were 5.2 (0.9), 5.4 (1.5), 5.2 (1.2), 9.8 (1.9), and 7.1 (4.6), respectively. The proportion of students who reported lifetime use, past year use, and past month use of opioids was 4.3% (1000/23,039), 1.8% (416/23,039), and 1.6% (362/23,039), respectively; the proportion of students who admitted lifetime use, past year use, and past month use of sedatives accounted for 4.5% (1029/23,039), 2.5% (577/23,039),

and 2.0% (454/23,039), respectively.

### 3.2. Univariable analyses of childhood maltreatment, depressive symptoms and NMUPD

Without adjusting for other variables, physical abuse, sexual abuse, and emotional neglect were significantly associated with lifetime use, past year use, and past month use of opioids and sedatives, respectively (P < 0.05). Emotional abuse was significantly associated with past year use and past month use of opioids, and related to lifetime use, past year use, and past month use of sedatives (P < 0.05); physical neglect was significantly associated with lifetime use, past year use, and past month use of sedatives (P < 0.05). Moreover, depressive symptoms were associated with lifetime use, past year use, and past month use of opioids and sedatives in the univariable multinomial logistic regression models (Table 2) (P < 0.05).

### 3.3. Multivariable analyses of childhood maltreatment and NMUPD without mediator

As shown in Table 3, after adjusting for gender, age, living arrangement, HSS, classmate relations, relationships with teachers, drinking, and smoking, our final multivariable multinomial logistic regression models found that physical abuse, sexual abuse, and emotional neglect were positively associated with lifetime use, past year use, and past month use of opioids and sedatives (P < 0.05); students who reported that they had experienced emotional abuse were at a higher risk of past year use and past month use of opioids (past year: Adjusted OR [AOR] = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.05-1.10; past month: AOR = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.06-1.10) and sedatives (past year: AOR = 1.06, 95% CI = 1.03-1.08; past month: AOR = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.13-1.16); those who reported having been emotionally neglected as children were more likely to be involved in lifetime, past year, and past month use of sedatives (P < 0.05).

3.4. Interactions between childhood maltreatment and depressive symptoms on NMUPD

The multivariable multinomial logistic regression analyses demonstrated that the interaction items (between physical abuse/emotional abuse/sexual abuse/physical neglect/emotional neglect and depressive symptoms) were not significantly associated with NMUPD (Table 4) (P > 0.05).

### 3.5. Mediating effects of depressive symptoms

First, physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, physical ne glect, and emotional neglect were incorporated to set up a latent variable (childhood maltreatment) in the adjusted mediated model, and the standardized path coefficients for opioids and sedatives were shown in Fig. 1: the direct standardized path coefficients of childhood maltreatment on depressive symptoms (standardized ß estimate = 0.298, 95% CI = 0.278-0.318) and of depressive symptoms on opioids use/sedatives were statistically significant (opioids use: standardized ß estimate = 0.025, 95% CI = 0.009-0.040; sedatives use: standardized ß estimate = 0.054, 95% CI = 0.038-0.070), indicating the associations between childhood maltreatment and opioids use/sedative use were partially mediated by depressive symptoms.

Next, each type of childhood maltreatment (physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, physical neglect, and emotional neglect), depressive symptoms and opioids use/sedatives use were entered in the adjusted structural equation models, respectively. Table 5 demonstrates that the standardized indirect effects of physical abuse on opioids use (standardized ß estimate = 0.005, 95% CI = 0.003-0.007) and on sedatives use (standardized ß estimate = 0.009, 95% CI = 0.007-0.011) through depressive symptoms were significant, Sample characteristics stratified by non-medical use of prescription drugs.

suggesting that depressive symptoms partially mediated the associations between physical abuse and opioids use/sedatives use. The standardized indirect effects of physical neglect on sedatives use via depressive symptoms were also significant (standardized ß estimate = 0.008, 95% CI = 0.006-0.010). Additionally, there were significant standardized indirect effects of emotional abuse/sexual abuse/emotional neglect on opioids use/sedatives use through depressive symptoms, respectively (P < 0.001).

### 4. Discussion

### 4.1. Summary of the findings

To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale study aimed to estimate the associations between childhood maltreatment and NMUPD among adolescents, and to assess whether depressive symptoms play a mediator role on the aforementioned associations. The results first indicated that without adjusting for other variables, physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, and emotional neglect were significantly associated with non-medical use of opioids and sedatives,

respectively. Similarly, McCauley et al. (2010) also found a significant association between potentially traumatic life events (e.g., childhood maltreatment) and NMUPD in a nationally representative sample of U.S. adolescents. Notably, our study failed to find a significant association between physical neglect and non-medical use of opioids, and the possible explanation for why physical neglect did not exhibit the same pattern of associations as other types of childhood maltreatment might be that physical neglect is defined as the ""neglectful"" failure to supply the physical needs (such as necessary food, medical care, and supervision) of the child, but it does not include the deliberate and malicious withholding of needs, which is a form of abuse (Golden et al., 2003); individuals who suffered physical neglect often still have their emotional needs met, which makes them feel protected and loved, and are a little different from those who encountered abuse or emotional neglect (Torchalla et al., 2012).

In addition, after adjusting for significant socio-demographic factors, our results found that although the effect sizes were slightly attenuated in all the adjusted models, physical abuse, sexual abuse, and emotional neglect were still associated with lifetime use, past year use, and past month use of opioids and sedatives, respectively; students who reported that they had encountered emotional abuse were at an elevated risk of past year use and past month use of opioids and sedatives; individuals who reported having been emotionally neglected as children were more likely to be involved in lifetime use, past year use, and past month use of sedatives. Similarly, Sansone et al. (2003) found a strong correlation between the number of traumatic experiences and the number of benzodiazepines ever taken in 53 outpatients from primary care services Longman-Mills et al. (2015); found a significant relationship between childhood maltreatment and past month drugs use (including NMUPD) among university students. Although there is few study conducted among adolescents to assess the association between childhood maltreatment and NMUPD, our recent study indicated that maltreatment while a child was related to an increased risk of past month prescription drugs use among Chinese adolescents (Guo et al.,

2017). One potential explanation for these associations might be that childhood maltreatment histories are associated with abnormalities of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function in the automatic nervous system's responses to stressors, including hypersecretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and alterations in the sensitivity of glucocorticoid negative feedback mechanisms (Gerritsen et al., 2017; Mello et al., 2009); for example, adolescents struggling with childhood maltreatment experiences may seek relief by using psychoactive drugs, and such negative reinforcement models, where individuals are thought to use drugs as a method of avoiding or

reducing the effects of adverse life events, have been proposed extensively (Baker et al., 2004). Another more remarkable reason may be that adolescents who suffered childhood maltreatment (e.g., physical abuse or emotional abuse) may represent a subgroup of the adolescent population who were less likely to be monitored by their caregivers, thus they might have more opportunities to access to prescription drugs (e.g., spending more time outside with social friends or finding prescription drugs at home). Despite the fact that the current study did not directly estimate the status of caregivers' supervision, this hypothesis deserved to be tested by future research. Moreover, another interesting finding of this study is that the magnitude of AORs for the association between each type of childhood maltreatment and NMUPD were highest among past month nonmedical users, and the effect sizes were generally greater for past year users than lifetime nonmedical users across five types of childhood maltreatment. These results might be related to that adverse childhood experience could lead to the development of addiction process and the long-lasting maintenance of the addicted state (Enoch, 2011); the cumulative effects of childhood maltreatment might be higher among past month and past year users than lifetime users, and then increased the probability of adverse outcomes (e.g., NMUPD) (Sameroff, 2000).

In line with previous studies (Guo et al., 2016a, 2016b, 2016c; Wu et al., 2008; Zullig and Divin, 2012), significant associations between depressive symptoms and non-medical use of opioids and sedatives were also shown in our univarable analyses. A potential explanation for these associations is that there is a tendency of adolescents with depressive symptoms to use psychoactive prescription drugs to alleviate unpleasant feelings or symptoms of depression (Khantzian, 1997). Moreover, considering mediation is easily confused with moderation (Lindley and Walker, 1993), and mediation analyses require exclusion of an interaction between the exposure and the mediator on the outcome. Therefore, we tested the interaction effects of childhood maltreatment and depressive symptoms on NMUPD before conducting the mediation analyses, and the results demonstrated that there were not statistically significant interaction effects. Next, a novel finding of our study was that the associations between physical abuse/neglect and nonmedical use of opioids/sedatives were partially mediated through depressive symptoms; the associations of sexual abuse/emotional neglect with opioids and sedatives were mediated by depressive symptoms; depressive symptoms also partially mediated the associations between physical neglect and sedatives use. A possible explanation for the mediating effects of depressive symptoms may be the neurobiological similarities between depressive symptoms and NMUPD (Shimamoto et al., 2011; Volkow, 2004). Moreover, it has been well established that childhood maltreatment is associated with depressive symptoms (Schalinski et al., 2016; Shapero et al., 2014), and that individuals with depressive symptoms are at an elevated risk of NMUPD (Guo et al., 2016a, 2016b, 2016c; Zullig and Divin, 2012). Taken together, the evaluation of the mediator role of depressive symptoms provides evidence for the current understanding of the mechanism of the association between childhood maltreatment and NMUPD. Although the mechanism that underlies the association between childhood maltreatment and NMUPD is complex and still not clear, our study provided evidence about the mediation effects of depressive symptoms on the association. Our findings recommended that (1) schools, families and clinicians should pay attention to adolescents with a history of childhood maltreatment and promote their resilience; (2) education programs targeted on families and schools should increase their awareness of the adverse effects of NMUPD, and educate them about risk reduction strategies (e.g., keeping prescription drugs in the home locked up; adopting contingency management methods when discovering adolescents' misuse); (3) it sounds obvious that adolescents with mental health problems (i.e., depressive mood and childhood maltreatment histories) should receive adequate levels of assistance and support; (4) clinicians or related professionals who identify or treat drug users should assess their histories of childhood maltreatment to

 address these problems and to reduce the risk of recurrent drug use; (5) considering the current legalization of many psychoactive drugs increases adolescents' access to these prescription drugs, government should strengthen regulations to limit sales of prescription drugs to adolescents.

### 4.2. Limitations

This study has several noteworthy strengths, including the analyses of data collected from a large-scale sample of Chinese adolescents and the use of mediation analyses to test the mediating effects of depressive symptoms on the associations of childhood maltreatment with NMUPD. Despite these strengths, our study has several limitations that should be considered. First, many adolescents who suffered childhood maltreatment or had the NMUPD behavior did not like to disclose such experiences for scaring social stigma, thus the data may be subjected to potential bias as these sensitive behaviors were assessed through selfreport questionnaires. Second, due to the cross-sectional nature of the data, no causal inference can be made regarding the observed associations. Cross-sectional estimates of mediation may be biased when mediation occurs over time, and cross-sectional estimates can either underestimate or overestimate longitudinal parameters (Maxwell and Cole, 2007; Maxwell et al., 2011). Therefore, results should be interpreted with caution, especially with regard to the longitudinal direct or indirect effects. Moreover, in our future studies, we hope to address the mediation effects of depressive symptoms on the associations between childhood maltreatment and NMUPD by using longitudinal study design. Third, this study used the retrospective self-report method to measure histories of childhood maltreatment cannot rule out the possibility of recall bias. Fourth, the study sample included only school students and did not include adolescents who had dropped out of school or were not present in school on the day that the survey was administered; childhood maltreatment, depressive symptoms, or NMUPD may be more common among adolescents who were absent. Fifth, the mediating effects of depressive symptoms on the associations of childhood maltreatment with NMUPD may be affected by Axis I comorbidities (such as anxiety or bipolar disorder). Unfortunately, this study only considered subjective feelings of depressive symptoms by using the CES-D scale.

#### 5. Conclusions

Our study identified that in the models without mediation, physical abuse, emotional abuse, sexual abuse, emotional neglect, and depressive symptoms were positively associated with opioids and sedatives use, respectively; physical neglect elevated the risk of sedatives use. Moreover, depressive symptoms partially mediated the aforementioned significant associations. Considering the growing of NMUPD has been a public health issue of concern, a proper surveillance system should be established in China by learning from the experiences of the NSDUH or MTF in the United States; schools and families should be awareness the adverse effects of NMUPD; enough attention should be paid to adolescents who have depressive symptoms, have encountered childhood maltreatment, or are involved in NMUPD.

# Abstract

Background-Prior research has found that pretreatment expectations of symptom improvement are positively correlated with depressive symptom change. The current investigation extends previous research by examining whether pretreatment outcome expectancies predict symptom change across several diagnostic categories within the context of an acute, naturalistic psychiatric setting.

Methods-Analyses were conducted to examine whether pretreatment outcome expectancies (credibility/expectancy questionnaire [CEQ]) predicted symptom improvement within major depression (N=420), bipolar disorder (N=120) and psychosis (N=36). Bootstrap mediation analyses were conducted to examine whether acquisition of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) skills (cognitive behavior therapy skills questionnaire [CBTSQ]) may mediate expectancyoutcome relations.

Results-Results indicated a differential pattern of associations across diagnoses. Patient CBT skills emerged as a significant mediator of expectancy-outcome relations, but only in the major depression group. Both behavioral and cognitive skills were significantly, and independently, associated with symptom improvement.

Limitations-Sample sizes were small in the bipolar manic subgroup and psychosis group. CBT skills and symptom measures were assessed at concurrent time points.

Conclusions-The present findings suggest that patient expectancies and CBT skills may have a differential impact on symptom change as a function of diagnostic category. The implication of these results and directions for future research are discussed.

### 1. Introduction

The placebo effect has generated increased attention in both the adult (Fournier et al., 2010; Kirsch et al., 2008) and youth (Cohen et al., 2010) depression treatment literatures. Funding agencies, including the National Institute of Health (NIH), have recently called for increased research aimed at elucidating the mechanisms through which the placebo effect results in patient improvement (RFA-DA-12-003, RFA-DA-12-004). A growing body of research indicates that the placebo effect may account for a relatively large proportion of the symptom improvement experienced by depressed patients in treatment. Although estimates vary across clinical trials, approximately 50% of individuals ""respond"" (typically defined as

50% reduction in depressive symptoms from pretreatment to posttreatment) to either psychotherapy or antidepressant medication during the acute phase of treatment. In contrast, approximately 30% of depressed patients respond to a pill placebo (Hollon et al.,, 2002; Walsh et al., 2002). These findings suggest that an estimated 60% (30%/50%) of symptom improvement in studies of antidepressants or psychotherapy for depression may be attributable to factors underlying placebo response (i.e., the expectation of symptom improvement, spontaneous remission of depressive symptoms), rather than due to the putative active ingredients of treatment. As stated by de la Fuente-Fernández et al. (2001), ""the simple act of receiving any treatment (active or not) may, in itself, be efficacious because of expectation of benefit"" (p. 1164). Indeed, prior research has found that pretreatment expectations of symptom improvement (i.e., outcome expectancies) are positively correlated with symptom change in the treatment of a range of different mental disorders, including depression and, perhaps to a lesser extent, anxiety disorders (e.g., Chambless et al., 1997; Joyce et al., 2003; Meyer et al., 2002; Westra et al., 2007; and see Constantino et al., 2011 for a recent meta-analytic review). It should be noted that expectancy-outcome findings are fairly mixed in the anxiety disorder literature (e.g., for non-significant findings in OCD, see Steketee et al., 2011; for GAD, see Borkovec et al., 2002). To date, the mechanisms through which the expectation of benefit may result in symptom improvement remain poorly understood.

In the field of psychotherapy research, a number of theorists have noted the important role that treatment outcome expectancies may play in contributing to symptom improvement (Devilly and Borkovec, 2000; Frank and Frank, 1993; Greenberg et al., 2006; Wampold, 2001). Goal theorists have also suggested ways in which expectancies may influence future outcomes (e.g., Austin and Vancouver, 1996; Eccles and Wigfield, 2002). Namely, whereas optimistic or positive expectancies may fuel effort towards desired goals, negative expectancies may lead to disengagement from or abandonment of goals. In psychotherapy, positive treatment outcome expectancies may motivate active engagement in the treatment process. With regards to cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), greater acquisition and use of the central cognitive and behavioral skills encouraged in treatment may help account for expectancy-outcome associations. That is, those patients who enter CBT treatment with greater expectations of symptom improvement may be more likely to engage in treatment, and acquire and utilize cognitive and behavioral skills. In turn, and consistent with CBT

theory (Beck et al., 1979; DeRubeis et al., 2010), acquisition and use of CBT skills may contribute to symptom improvement.

As discussed above, studies suggest that placebo response rates are relatively high in studies of depression treatment. Interestingly, studies have found that some mental disorders are associated with higher placebo response rates than others. Depressed patients, for example, have been found to exhibit higher levels of placebo response than patients suffering from psychosis (Khan et al., 2005). This may not be surprising given the various factors that may underlie and account for placebo response, including spontaneous remission of symptoms and the therapeutic benefit of positive treatment outcome expectancies. More specifically, higher placebo response rates in depression may be due in part to the typically episodic, or time-limited nature of depressive episodes. Moreover, depressive symptoms may be relatively more responsive to the hopefulness and remoralization engendered by positive treatment outcome expectancies (Frank and Frank, 1993). Findings regarding differential placebo response rates across disorders may be relevant to research examining the association between treatment outcome expectancies and symptom improvement. Namely, to the extent that a relatively large proportion of symptom improvement in a diagnostic group (e.g., depression) is due to factors underlying placebo response (e.g., treatment outcome expectancies), one might expect a stronger association between treatment outcome expectancies and actual symptom change within that disorder.

 Previous research examining the role of pretreatment outcome expectancies has typically relied on depressed (or anxiety-disordered) samples receiving treatment within outpatient settings. To our knowledge, no published study has systematically examined what role pretreatment outcome expectancies may play in contributing to symptom improvement within other severe mental disorders (e.g., psychotic disorders) in the context of a psychiatric hospital setting. It may be that treatment outcome expectancies have a differential impact on symptom improvement depending on the diagnosis in question. As discussed above, given the relatively low placebo response rates in psychosis, and its chronic nature, one might expect a relatively small relationship between treatment outcome expectancies and symptom improvement in the latter disorder. Moreover, it is also unclear to what extent patient expectations of symptom improvement influence other mood states, for example bipolar manic symptomatology (e.g., Gaudiano and Miller, 2006). Finally, to the extent that pretreatment outcome expectancies do predict symptom improvement in a given disorder, what mediates this association? Within CBT, does patient acquisition and use of cognitive and behavioral skills mediate expectancy-outcome associations?

#### 1.1. The current study

The current study had several objectives. First, within the context of an acute psychiatric setting, we examined whether the expectation of symptom improvement predicts symptom change across several, severe diagnostic categories. To assess symptom improvement, we included both a measure of depressive symptoms and a measure of broad symptomatology and functioning domains. Second, we examined whether patient acquisition and use of CBT skills were associated with symptom improvement across these diagnostic groups. Third, we

examined whether CBT skills mediated the association between treatment outcome expectancies and symptom improvement.

Accordingly, we tested three related hypotheses

- 1. Pretreatment expectations of symptom improvement will predict subsequent symptom change in the major depression and bipolar-depressed samples, but not in the psychosis or bipolar-manic samples.
- 2. Patient use of CBT skills will be associated with symptom improvement within all four diagnostic categories.
- 3. Patient use of CBT skills will mediate the association between treatment outcome expectancies and actual symptom improvement in the major depression and bipolar-depressed samples.

It is important to note that the current study was conducted in a naturalistic treatment environment, and accordingly, the data have limitations commonly found in other work in clinical settings (Westbrook and Kirk, 2005), including relatively elevated rates of missing data and lack of a control group to which patients are randomly assigned. However, because patients in this study were unselected and inclusion criteria were few, findings from this study are likely to be highly generalizable to other ""real-world"" psychiatric settings.

# 2. Method

#### 2.1. Participants

Participants were patients presenting for treatment at the Behavioral Health Partial Program (BHPP), a partial hospital program at McLean Hospital, Belmont, MA. To be included in the present study, patients had to be admitted to the BHPP and have completed the selfreport battery of measures at both admission and discharge (see Section 2.3). The present study focused on the association between treatment outcome expectancies (assessed at admission), CBT skill use (assessed at admission and discharge), and symptom improvement (assessed at admission and discharge) in patients presenting with primary diagnoses of current major depression, bipolar disorder, or psychosis. For this reason, inclusion criteria were that patients met criteria for a current, primary diagnosis of major depression, bipolar disorder (currently manic/hypomanic or depressed), or a psychotic disorder. A total of 576 patients met criteria for one of these diagnoses during the study period (July 2010 to July 2012), agreed to participate in the research study, and completed intake and discharge research assessments.

The average duration of treatment for these patients was 11.43 (SD=4.08) patient days. Diagnostic comorbidity in this population was common: 73% (n=421) of the current sample met criteria for more than one DSM-IV disorder, with an average of 3.4 diagnoses (SD=1.3). Previous episodes of depression were exceedingly common, with a mean of 7.6 (SD=13.7) reported previous depressive episodes.

 Bipolar patients were divided into two subcategories based on their most recent symptomatic episode, including bipolar, current episode depressed (bipolar-depressed) or

current episode manic or hypomanic (bipolar-manic). The final sample included 576 patients: 420 in the depression group, 94 in the bipolar-depressed group, 26 in the bipolarmanic group, and 36 in the psychosis group.

#### 2.2. Treatment

The BHPP offers both pharmacological and cognitive-behavioral treatment to patients presenting with symptoms across major diagnostic categories. The program focuses on the acquisition of cognitive behavioral skills and uses a flexible approach to treatment informed by CBT principles and current evidence, although it is adapted to the unique challenges of a naturalistic partial hospital setting (Neuhaus, 2006). The program offers more than 100, 50min CBT-based groups per week. Individual treatment plans are constructed for each patient by clinical team managers who conduct initial intake assessments and oversee all aspects of treatment. The treatment consists of group CBT provided by BHPP staff including psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, occupational therapists, postdoctoral and graduate level psychology trainees, and mental health counselors. Patients attend five 50min CBT skill focused groups each day, five days per week (Monday-Friday). Of these, patients attend one group per day focused on behavioral activation, based on a protocol adapted from Martell et al., (2010). A second group teaches patients skills in identifying and challenging negative automatic thoughts and is guided by a protocol adapted from Beck et al., (1979). The remaining groups include modules on psychoeduction, self-monitoring, mindfulness, and interpersonal skills, adapted from other empirically supported CBT manuals (Beck et al., 1985; Linehan, 1993). To maintain treatment fidelity, groups utilize treatment protocols designed for the program, derived from established treatment manuals and groups are selectively observed by postdoctoral fellows and staff psychologists. In addition to group therapy, patients also receive two to three weekly individual, skills-based CBT sessions from a pre-doctoral psychology intern or postdoctoral fellow, which complement and individually tailor content from groups attended.

#### 2.3. Measures

Miniature International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI; Sheehan et al., 1998) The MINI is a structured interview assessing for DSM-IV Axis I symptoms (e.g., mood, anxiety, substance abuse, psychosis). Each MINI diagnostic module consists of a series of screening items followed by questions about specific symptomatology. The MINI has strong reliability and validity in relation to the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-IV), with inter-rater reliabilities ranging from kappas of .89-1.0 (Sheehan et al., 1998). The MINI was administered by trained doctoral students in clinical psychology and psychology interns who met weekly with a postdoctoral fellow for supervision.

Credibility/expectancy questionnaire (CEQ; Devilly and Borkovec, 2000). The CEQ is a 6item measure divided into two subscales assessing treatment credibility (CEQ-Credibility) and expectancy (CEQ-Expectancy), respectively, and it has demonstrated adequate reliability and validity in previous research (Devilly and Borkovec, 2000). Cronbach's alpha for both subscales was high in the sample (a=. 81 for credibility, a=. 89 for expectancy).

Cognitive behavior therapy skills questionnaire (CBTSQ-16; Jacob et al., 2011) The CBTSQ is a 16-item measure designed to assess cognitive behavioral skills. The measure is divided into two subscales assessing cognitive restructuring (""Catch myself when I jump to conclusions"") and behavioral activation (""Socialize even though I don't feel like it""). Items are rated on a 1 (none of the time) to 5 (all of the time) Likert-type scale. The CBTSQ-16 was validated among patients within the BHPP and demonstrated high internal consistency (c=. 84 for cognitive restructuring, a=.80 for behavioral activation; see Jacob et al., 2011).

Center for the epidemiologic studies of depression scale-10 (CES-D-10; Andresen et al., 1994). The CES-D-10 is a widely used, brief instrument for assessing depressive symptoms. Response anchors range temporally from 0=rarely or none of the time (less than 1 day) to 3=most or all of the time (5-7 days). Previous studies have suggested cut-off scores for significant depression of 10 or greater (Andresen et al., 1994; Kuptniratsaikul et al., 2002). The CES-D-10 appears to be reliable and valid (Zhang and Li, 2011) and had high internal consistency in this study (pretreatment a=. 84; posttreatment a=. 87).

Behavior and symptom identification scale (BASIS-24; Eisen et al., 2004). The BASIS-24 is a 24-item measure that has demonstrated good psychometric properties across inpatient, outpatient, residential, and partial hospital settings as a broad assessment of psychopathology and associated distress. Previous literature supports the factor structure, reliability, validity and sensitivity to treatment changes of BASIS-24 (Eisen et al., 2006). The BASIS-24 was selected given that it assesses a wide array of symptoms relevant to the different diagnostic groups examined in the current study, rather than using multiple measures and increasing patient research burden in our primarily clinical setting. The BASIS-24 consists of six subscales which assess for symptoms over the past week: (1) depression/functioning (""Feel sad or depressed?""), (2) interpersonal problems (""Get along with people in your family?""), (3) self-harm (""Think about hurting yourself?""), (4) emotional liability (""Have mood swings?""), (5) psychosis (""Hear voices or see things?""), and (6) substance abuse/dependence (""Did you have an urge to drink alcohol or take street drugs?""). Respondents rate items on a 5-point Likert-type scale from 0 (none of the time) to 4 (all of the time) and higher scores indicating worse functioning. Subscales range from 0-8 (self-harm) to 0-24 (depression/functioning) and total scores reflect overall functioning. Reliability of BASIS-24 total scores in the current study was high (preatreatment a-. 84; posttreatment a=.86).

#### 2.4. Procedure

Approval for the study was granted by the hospital's Institutional Review Board (IRB). All data were collected on site at the hospital BHPP. Before receiving any form of treatment, patients completed the MINI, a demographics survey, and a battery of self-report measures described above; the battery of self-report measures was also completed at discharge. Study personnel provided instructions indicating the participant's freedom to withdraw from the research study at any point or refuse to respond to any items.

#### 3. Results

#### 3.1. Data analytic strategy

Analyses were conducted using SAS Version 9.2 PROC GLM and PROC REG (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). A SAS macro was used for bootstrap mediation analyses (see Preacher and Hayes, 2008). Simulation studies indicate that the traditional Baron and Kenny (1986) causal steps approach to testing mediation suffers from relatively low power (Fritz and MacKinnon, 2007; MacKinnon et al., 2002). Bootstrap mediation, a nonparametric sampling procedure, offers a more powerful alternative and does not make the assumption that the sampling distribution of the indirect effect is normal, when it is often asymmetric. Moreover, the SAS macro employed in the current study allows for the testing of several mediators simultaneously (in the current study, both cognitive and behavioral skills). We utilized 3000 bootstrap samples for coefficient and indirect effect estimation. Confidence intervals (95% Cls) for the indirect effect that exclude zero indicate that the indirect effect was statistically significant at the .05 level and mediation was demonstrated (see bold values in Mediation Tables 4 and 5). To adjust for pretreatment (wave 1) values, posttreatment (wave 2) variables were in the format of residualized change scores (standardized; MacKinnon, 2008).

Given that the study was conducted in a clinical (i.e., psychiatric hospital) rather than research setting, some patients did not complete all of the self-report and diagnostic measures at admission or discharge for a variety of reasons (e.g., conflicting appointments for individual or group therapy, clinical crises resulting in admission to clinical evaluation center or inpatient unit). Twenty-six percent % (n=148) of the sample provided incomplete data and, thus, were excluded from the bootstrap mediation analyses predicting BASIS symptom improvement, whereas (19% [n=111] patients had incomplete data for the analyses predicting CES-D-10 symptom change). As detailed in Footnote, the mediation analyses reported in the results section were rerun after replacing missing data via imputation, yielding nearly identical findings.

Table 1 displays the raw observed means and standard deviations for all variables at pretreatment (T1) and posttreatment (T2) by diagnostic category. Of note, and as expected, self-reported depression scores (CES-D) were highest among major depression and bipolar depressed groups. Interestingly, the bipolar manic patients reported the highest T1 expectations of improvement (see CEQ scores). Björgvinsson et al. (submitted manuscript) have reported on the treatment outcome data for this sample. See Table 2 for diagnostic characteristics and comorbidity in each group and Table 3 for correlations between study variables at pretreatment.

<sup>2</sup>To examine the possible impact of missing data on our findings mediation analyses were rerun following a hot deck imputation procedure. The procedure involves matching each case with missing data to another similar case in the dataset, based on researcherdefined characteristics, in this case age, gender, and race. The missing datapoint is then replaced with the matching case's value. This method has advantages over list wise deletion (see Andridge and Little, 2010; Myers, 2011). A very similar pattern of findings emerged with the imputed dataset as those reported in Tables 4 and 5. The only difference emerged for the psychosis group. Specifically, a nonsignificant trend emerged for the association between CBT skills and CESD symptom improvement see Table 5, path b).

Hypothesis 1. Treatment outcome expectancies and symptom improvement-As seen in Table 4 (path c), pretreatment CEQ-Expectancy was a significant predictor of BASIS symptom improvement in the major depression group only. Similarly, higher CEO-Expectancy scores were significantly associated with greater CES-D-10 symptom improvement only in the major depression group (see Table 5; path c).

Hypothesis 2. CBT skills and symptom improvement-Next, we examined the association between the acquisition and use of CBT skills and symptom improvement across the four diagnostic groups. As seen in Table 4 (path b), greater acquisition and use of CBT skills was associated with greater BASIS symptom improvement in the major depression and bipolar-depressed (but not the bipolar-manic or psychosis) groups. The same pattern of findings emerged when the above analyses were rerun using CES-D symptom improvement as the dependent variable (see Table 5; path b).

Hypothesis 3. Bootstrap mediation analyses-The necessity of establishing a statistically significant association between X (in the current study, CEQ-Expectancy) and Y (in this case. BASIS or CES-D-10 symptom improvement) in mediation analyses has been called into question by some researchers (e.g., Collins et al., 1998; MacKinnon, 2000; MacKinnon et al., 2000; Shrout and Bolger, 2002). Indeed, there are several approaches to statistical mediation that do not require a significant relationship between X and Y, including the bootstrap mediation approach employed in the current study (e.g., see Kraemer et al., 2002; Shrout and Bolger, 2002; MacKinnon et al., 2002). Thus, as noted above, although the expectancy-symptom improvement relationship was only significant for the major depression group, mediation analyses were carried out for all groups (see Tables 4 and 5).

First, bootstrap mediation analyses were conducted to test whether patient use of CBT skills mediated the relationship between the expectation of symptom improvement and BASIS symptom change. As seen in Table 4 (see bolded 95% Cls for indirect [i.e., mediation] effects), patient use of CBT skills only mediated the expectancy-symptom improvement relationship in the major depression sample.

Given the significant mediation findings for the major depression group, the latter mediation analysis was rerun while separating the CBT skills variable into its two constituent factors: Cognitive restructuring and behavioral activation (i.e., running a multiple mediator model with both factors included as mediating variables simultaneously). Interestingly, as seen in Table 4, both the behavioral activation and cognitive restructuring factors emerged as significant mediators. The same pattern emerged with regards to the prediction of CES-D-10 symptom improvement (see Table 5).

The sample size for major depression group was larger than for either the psychosis, bipolardepressed, or bipolar-manic groups. The smaller sample size, and resulting lower power, in theory could account for the nonsignificant mediation findings for the latter three groups. However, even when pooling the samples for these three groups mediation analyses were nonsignificant for both the expectancy-CES-D-10 symptom change (N=125; bootstrap 95% CI [-0.13, 0.01]) and expectancy-BASIS symptom change relationships (N=110; bootstrap 95% CI [-0.10, 0.01]). Moreover, the standardized betas for the relations between treatment

expectancies, CBT skills and symptom improvement were consistently larger for the major depression group relative to other diagnostic groups, indicating stronger associations in the former sample (see paths a-c in Tables 4 and 5).

## 4. Discussion

The placebo effect has received increased attention in the mental health treatment literature (Fournier et al., 2010; Kirsch et al., 2008). As stated by de la Fuente-Fernández et al. (2001), ""the simple act of receiving any treatment (active or not) may, in itself, be efficacious because of expectation of benefit"" (p. 1164). Although prior research has found that pretreatment expectations of symptom improvement correlate positively with symptom change across several different mental disorders, in particular depression (e.g., Chambless et al., 1997; Joyce et al., 2003; Meyer et al., 2002; Westra et al., 2007; see Constantino et al., 2011 for a recent meta-analytic review), the mechanisms underlying this association are poorly understood. Moreover, research in this area has typically relied on outpatient samples. Thus, it is unclear to what extent expectancy-outcome findings would replicate in relatively more acutely symptomatic inpatient populations. The present study builds on this literature by examining whether the expectation of symptom improvement predicts symptom change among patients suffering from major depression, bipolar disorder, or psychosis in the context of a severe patient population within an acute psychiatric setting. In addition, mediation analyses were conducted to test whether patient acquisition and use of CBT skills mediated expectancy-outcome associations.

Our hypotheses were partially supported. First, pretreatment expectations of symptom improvement significantly predicted symptom change in the major depression group, but not in the bipolar or psychosis samples. In line with these findings, it may be that positive treatment outcome expectancies are more therapeutically beneficial within depressed patients, relative to patients suffering from bipolar or psychotic symptomatology. This pattern of findings may be understood in light of evidence of high placebo response rates in depression relative to other disorders, including psychosis (e.g., Khan et al., 2005) and perhaps mania (e.g., Keck et al., 2000; see also Gaudiano and Miller, 2006 for nonsignificant expectancy-outcome findings in mania). To the extent that treatment outcome expectancies in part drive the magnitude of placebo response (Finniss et al., 2010), one might expect a stronger expectancy-outcome relationship within those disorders that are more responsive to placebo (e.g., unipolar depression). It is also interesting to note that although bipolar-manic patients reported the highest expectations of treatment benefit across all diagnostic groups (see Table 1), higher expectancies did not predict better treatment outcomes for manic patients. These elevated expectancy scores may reflect, on average, excessively optimistic (and perhaps counter-therapeutic) treatment outcome expectancies among these patients.

In an effort to probe what may mediate the relationship between pretreatment expectations of symptom improvement and actual symptom change, the present study assessed the extent to which patients acquire and use the CBT skills encouraged in our treatment program. Bootstrap mediation analyses indicated that patient acquisition and use of CBT skills mediated the expectancy-outcome relationship in the major depression diagnostic group.

The same pattern of findings emerged for both outcome variables (BASIS and CES-D-10; see Tables 4 and 5). Interestingly, when the CBT skills measure was separated into its constituent cognitive and behavioral subscales, and a multiple mediation model was tested including both subscales, both cognitive and behavioral skills emerged as significant mediators of the expectancy-outcome relationship.

CBT skills did not emerge as a significant mediator in the psychosis, bipolar-depressed, or bipolar-manic groups. Even when combining the samples from these three groups, coupled with the use of a relatively powerful bootstrapping approach to testing mediation (MacKinnon et al., 2004; Preacher and Hayes, 2008), CBT skills did not emerge as a significant mediator. There was no significant relationship between outcome expectancies and symptom change (i.e., nonsignificant total effect; see path c; Tables 4 and 5) to mediate in the bipolar or psychosis groups. Even so, a nonsignificant total effect does not preclude the possibility of mediation (e.g., Collins et al., 1998; MacKinnon, 2000; MacKinnon et al., 2000; Shrout and Bolger, 2002). It may be that bipolar and psychotic patients with greater treatment outcome expectancies are less likely to acquire and utilize CBT skills and/or that these skills are less therapeutically beneficial to these patients, at least in the context of a short-term partial hospital program. It should be noted, however, that there is increasing evidence of the efficacy of CBT for psychosis in the context of relatively longer-term treatments (Grant et al., 2012; Turkington et al., 2008). Moreover, CBT skills were significantly associated with symptom improvement in the bipolar-depressed group.

There remains substantial debate in the psychotherapy literature regarding the relative importance of ""common factors"" (i.e., those elements of treatment that are shared across most, if not all, treatment modalities) versus ""specific factors"" (i.e., the core, theoryspecified techniques of a given treatment) in contributing to symptom improvement (Imel and Wampold, 2008; Siev et al., 2009; Wampold, 2001; Webb et al., 2010). Expectancy represents one of the most frequently discussed common factors in the psychotherapy literature; whereas cognitive and behavioral techniques represent the core, theory-specified specific factors of CBT. The findings from the current study may reflect a way in which a theoretically important specific factor (i.e., patient acquisition and use of CBT skills) and a common factor (treatment outcome expectancies) interact in predicting symptom improvement. That is, CBT skills mediated the expectancy-outcome relationship within our major depression sample. With regards to clinical implications, it may be especially important for therapists to assess patient treatment expectancies, and to work to foster optimistic - yet realistic - expectations of improvement among their depressed clients.

Several limitations of the present study should be noted. First, and similar to Jacob et al. (2011), the cognitive and behavioral subscales of the CBTSQ were generally highly correlated causing problems for interpretations of findings when both variables were simultaneously included in our multiple mediator model. Second, although temporal confounds were statistically controlled in the analyses predicting symptom change and CBT skills change from pretreatment outcome expectancies, they were not controlled in our analyses correlating change in CBT skills and symptom improvement (i.e., both variables were assessed concurrently, at pretreatment and posttreatment). Thus, the significant association between CBT skills and symptom improvement in the major depression may be
due, at least in part, to the influence of symptom improvement on self-reported CBT skills, rather than the reverse relationship. Although this is an important limitation, it should be highted that this represents only one of the four paths comprising the mediation analyses reported in Tables 4 and 5 (i.e., path b). That is, there were no temporal confounds in the analyses predicting symptom improvement or CBT skill acquisition from pretreatment expectancies (paths a, c, and c'). Third, sample sizes were small in the psychosis, and especially in the bipolar-manic, subgroup, which may help account for nonsignificant findings within these groups. In addition, our findings emerged within a specific context (i.e., an observational study within a short-term partial hospital program). It is unclear to what extent our findings would replicate in other treatment settings (e.g., longer-term outpatient care).

The current study raises issues that should be addressed in future research. One of the strengths of the current study is the inclusion of a large sample of patients from a naturalistic clinical setting within a psychiatric hospital. In order to limit patient burden in our clinical sample we were not permitted to include more than two waves of data collection (i.e., pretreatment and posttreatment). A more comprehensive examination of CBT skill use, patient expectancies and symptoms across additional time points would provide for a more in-depth picture of how these constructs change and interact with one another over time. In addition, the current study focused on the role of pretreatment expectancies in predicting symptom change, which may be an important psychological mediator of placebo response (Price et al., 2008). However, there are likely other processes that were not assessed in the current study, and which play important roles in contributing to placebo responses, such as classical conditioning (see Finniss et al., 2010; Price et al., 2008 for a review). Moreover, although we examined a possibly important treatment-specific factor mediating the expectancy-outcome relationship (i.e., CBT skills; Constantino, 2012), there are likely other important mediators that were not assessed in the current study (e.g., the therapeutic alliance). The results of such future investigations could help researchers identify variables that play important roles in contributing to symptom improvement. Such findings could ultimately yield important clinical implications for the delivery of optimal treatment for these debilitating disorders.

#### Abstract

#### Introduction

Guided by Beck's (1967) cognitive theory of depression, we assessed whether perceived family functioning (PFF) mediated the relationship between depressive symptomatology and helpseeking inclinations.

#### Methods

Study 1 included 130 Spanish-Dominant Hispanics and Study 2 included 124 Non-Hispanic Whites obtained using online crowd sourcing. Participants completed measures of depressive symptomatology, PFF, and several scales measuring aspects of help seeking inclinations and self-stigma. Study 2 also included an experiment. With an eye toward potential future interventions, we assessed the malleability of PFF. Specifically, participants were randomly assigned to recall positive or negative family experiences and then PFF was measures for a second time.

#### Results

Both studies found PFF mediates the relationship between depressive symptomatology and the help seeking scales. Among non-depressed people, the positive manipulation improved PFF; however, among participants with elevated depressive symptomatology, writing about a positive

#### DEPRESSION AND HELP-SEEKING

family experience worsened PFF.

#### Limitation

With the exception of the experiment, most of the data was cross-sectional. For the experiment, it is possible that different manipulations or primes could have different effects.

#### Conclusion

Whether investigating responses from Spanish-Dominant Hispanics or Non-Hispanic Whites, PFF mediates the negative relationship between heightened depressive symptomatology and familial help-seeking beliefs, as well as self-stigma. However, even though the mediation analysis offers preliminary support that increasing PFF can potentially increase help-seeking behaviors of Hispanic and Non-Hispanic White people with depression, the results of the interaction analysis, specifically the negative impact of writing about positive family memories on people with elevated depression, illustrates the challenges of persuading people with depression.

Keywords: depression, help-seeking, perceived family functioning, cognitive theory of depression, and culture.

#### Introduction

Every year, depression affects more than 350 million people worldwide (World Health Organization; WHO, 2016). Depression has been identified as a leading risk factor for suicide; internationally, researchers estimate that approximately one suicide occurs every 40 seconds (Kposowa & Glyniadaki, 2012), with over 800,000 deaths worldwide every year (WHO, 2016). Unlike many other health conditions, as depression symptoms increase, people with depression

#### DEPRESSION AND HELP-SEEKING

are less likely to seek treatment (Barney, Griffiths, Jorm, & Christensen, 2006; Sawyer et al., 2012). Although depression is treatable, Kessler and colleagues' (2003) findings indicate that less than half of people with major depressive disorder receive adequate treatment.

Beck's cognitive theory of depression (CTD; Beck, 1964, 1987; Beck & Bredemeier, 2016; Beck, Rush, Shaw, & Emery, 1979) can partially explain the lack of help-seeking among people with elevated levels of depressive symptomatology. Beck (1967) proposed that the cognitions of people suffering from depressive symptomatology differ from non-depressed people in that they perceive the world through a depressogenic schema, the negative cognitive triad, and cognitive errors. The depressogenic schema is the causal aspect of the theory and involves faulty patterns in attitudes and beliefs that cause cogmitions to take on a negative bias (Beck, 1987). This negative bias causes cognitive errors (e.g., absolutistic dichotomous thinking) and leads people to think negatively about themselves, the world, and the future (Beck et al., 1979). As depression severity increases, so does the extremity of negative bias (Beck, 1967; Beck et al., 1979).

This negative bias impacts nearly all thoughts, including cognitions about help-seeking. Accordingly, prior studies indicate that higher levels of depressive symptomatology are associated with less favorable attitudes toward help-seeking (Lienemann & Siegel, 2015), reduced confidence that help-seeking will lead to favorable outcomes (Siegel, Lienemann, & Tan, 2015), and less confidence that social support is available (Lienemann, Siegel, & Crano, 2013). Such data elucidates why roughly half of the people who commit suicide do so without mentioning their intentions to anyone (Kisley, Campbell, Cartwright, Bowes, & Jackson, 2011).

This research endeavor follows-up on a recent study conducted by Keeler, Siegel, and Alvaro (2014) which, guided by Beck's CTD, tested whether familism (i.e., a multidimensional

#### DEPRESSION AND HELP-SEEKING

construct whereby importance of family overshadows the needs and desires of individual members; Katiria Perez, & Cruess, 2014) mediated the negative relationship between depressive symptomatology and informal help-seeking among Spanish-Dominant Hispanics in Arizona. Even though the data were cross-sectional and therefore cannot be used to make causal claims, these data indicate that increased levels of depressive symptomatology are associated with reduced comfort in approaching family about depression, less confidence that family support can provide useful assistance, and lower scores on a familism scale that included items such as, ""I expect my relatives to help me when I need them."" Further, familism mediated the relationship between depressive symptomatology and the two measures assessing family-related help-seeking cognitions. These findings not only illustrate the range of help-seeking cognitions that are impaired by heightened levels of depressive symptomatology, but also indicate a possible path for reducing the negative impact that heightened levels of depressive symptomatology has on familial help-seeking; namely, increasing favorable perceptions of familial bonds. If perceptions of familial bonds could be favorably influenced, such an approach could be particularly useful because when people do seek help, informal sources, including family, typically represent the most likely and accessible source of help for people with depression (Walters, Buszewicz, Weich, & King, 2008).

# The Current Studies

With the goal of further exploring the relationship between depression and help-seeking cognitions, the current study replicated, expanded, and brought an experimental design to the efforts of Keeler and colleagues (2014). In order to examine the external validity of Keeler and colleagues' findings, we used different recruitment methods and a different mode of data collection. Unlike Keeler and colleagues', this study focused on perceived family functioning

#### DEPRESSION AND HELP-SEEKING

(PFF; i.e., the transactional patterns of the family system that strongly influences behavior involving family members; Miller, Ryan, Keitner, Bishop, & Epstein, 2000), rather than familism. This change was made due to the current research endeavor exploring the generalizability of results for both Hispanics (Study 1) as well as Non-Hispanic Whites and a prior study indicated that familism is less predictive of cognitions when the respondents are Non-Hispanic whites (Siegel et al., 2012).

The central hypothesis for the current study, similar to Keeler and colleagues (2014) is that PFF mediates the negative relationship between increased levels of depressive symptomatology and negative familial help-seeking cognitions (H1). The suite of beliefs that we proposed are affected and were tested as outcome measures in sub-hypotheses (H1a-H1f) include help-seeking self-efficacy, the perceived utility of family support (i.e., is family support useful), perception of whether their family could help them (i.e., family has the resources), perception if family would help them (i.e., family would use resources to help), perceived familial consequences, and self-stigma. Even though studies have previously identified that increased levels of depression are associated with reduced PFF (Dwight-Johnson et al., 2010) and that increased levels of depression are associated with a reduced likelihood of seeking help from family members (Keeler et al., 2014), few studies have explored whether there is an indirect relationship between depression and family-based help-seeking cognitions through PFF.

As noted, Study 2 examined whether the results are specific to Spanish-Dominant Hispanics or if they are generalizable to Non-Hispanic Whites. Study 2 also included an experimental manipulation designed to begin to consider possible intervention strategies. Specifically, with an eye towards intervention, Study 2 examined whether priming past experiences where participants' family members provided social support could minimize the

#### DEPRESSION AND HELP-SEEKING

negative influence of depressive symptomatology on PFF. As described earlier, depression is associated with increased negative bias (Beck, 1967). Haque, Khan, and Hasking (2014) found that people with depression generally recalled more negatively valenced autobiographical memories than positive when compared to non-depressed people. However, we expected the experimental manipulation would assist in the recall of positive experiences by making positive familial relations salient and thus temporarily improving PFF for those with elevated depressive symptomatology (H2). If successful, a potential means for intervention would be indicated. Therefore, our hypotheses are as follows:

H1. Perceived family functioning would mediate the relationship between depressive symptomatology and a suite of help seeking behaviors.

H2. Perceived social support is malleable such that when people with heightened depressive symptomatology engage in an autobiographic recall task focused on prior experience of family support, PFF will be increased. When people with heightened depressive symptomatology engage in an autobiographic recall task focused on prior negative experience of family support, PFF will decrease.

#### Study 1

The goals of Study 1 were to illustrate the generalizability of the ability of PFF to mediate the relationship between depression and help seeking cognitions in a broader group of Spanish-Dominant Hispanics recruited from across the US (Keeler et al., 2014). Data supporting our hypothesis could provide evidence of the robustness of the relationships among depressive symptomatology, PFF, and help-seeking for a broader group of Hispanics.

# Method

#### Participants

#### DEPRESSION AND HELP-SEEKING

Participants were recruited from across the US using Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk), an online a crowd sourcing website. Previous research indicates MTurk has comparable results to pen and paper surveys (Buhrmester, Kwang, & Gosling, 2011). People who were at least 18 years old, considered Spanish as their primary language, and resided in the US were invited to take part in this anonymous 10-minute survey aimed at gaining an understanding of depression within the Hispanic community. Interested participants were provided with a link to the survey where they completed an informed consent along with several measures in Spanish and were compensated \$1.20. Back translation was used to ensure the informed consent, measures, and debriefing were accurately translated (Brislin, 1970; Harkness, Pennell, & Schoua-Glusberg, 2004). Approval was granted from an Institutional Review Board and fully complied with the provisions of the World Medical Association of Helsinki.

#### Measures

#### Depression

The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II; Beck, Steer, & Brown, 1996) is one of the most commonly used depression assessments and includes 21 questions to determine an individual's level of depressive symptomatology over the past two weeks (Study 1: a = . 95; Study 2: α = 96). One example of a question related to sadness ranges from 0 (I do not feel sad) to 3 (I am so sad or unhappy that I can't stand it). A composite score was calculated by summing the score of each of the 21 questions. Composite scores can range from 0-63 with higher scores indicating greater depressive symptomatology. Beck and colleagues (1996) notes four levels of depression symptomatology: scores of 0-13 represent none to minimal, 14-19 mild, 20-28 moderate, and 29-

#### DEPRESSION AND HELP-SEEKING

63 severe. 1

# Family functioning

Family functioning was assessed using the general functioning subscale of the Family Assessment Device (FAD; Epstein, Baldwin, & Bishop, 1983). We found the 12-item general functioning subscale internally consistent (Study 1: a = . 87; Study 2: a = . 95 [premanipulation], α = . 96 [postmanipulation]). Example questions include: Individuals are accepted for what they are and We don't get along well together. Questions were measured using 7-point Likert scales (1 = strongly disagree to 7 = strongly agree); negatively worded items were reverse scored before summing to generate a composite. Unless otherwise stated, all remaining scales used a similar response set. Greater scores on this scale indicated positive family functioning.

# Help-seeking self-efficacy

This scale was developed for this study because an appropriate help-seeking self-efficacy scale assessing participants' perceptions of their ability to seek help from loved ones for depression could not be located. The six questions are loosely based on Caprara, Regalia, Scabini, Barbaranelli, and Bandura's (2004) Assessment of Filial, Parental, Marital, and Collective Family Efficacy Beliefs and as well as Siegel and colleagues' (2015) Help-Seeking Outcome Expectation scale. The directions instructed participants to imagine they were depressed. The current scale included: I would feel comfortable asking my loved ones for help if I were depressed, I would know how to ask my loved ones for help, I would know how to approach my loved ones for help, I have the confidence to ask my family for help, I could prepare myself to ask for my loved ones help, and I feel I have the ability to ask my loved ones for help. Greater scores indicate higher levels of self-efficacy (Study 1: α = .95; Study 2: α = .96).

<sup>1</sup> See Table 1 for means, standard deviations, and possible range of scores for all measures.
# Utility of family support

To assess the degree participants felt that family support is a viable means to successfully overcome depression, one question adapted from Siegel and colleagues (2012; see also Keeler et al., 2014) required participants to rate the likelihood that one's immediate family would be useful in helping them overcome depression. A greater score indicated a greater belief in the utility of familial support to overcome depression.

### Family could offer help

The could scale included two questions seeking to ascertain what families could do to help a family member with depression using their current resources (e.g., time, money). An established scale could not be located. Directions for this scale instructed people to imagine they were depressed. The two questions were: If I asked, my loved ones could help me find a solution for my depression and My loved ones could do anything to help me overcome depression (Study 1: r = . 73; Study 2: r = . 84). Greater scores indicated the belief that a participants' family had more behavioral capabilities and could help them overcome depression.

# Family would offer help

This scale included four questions asking participants to imagine their family has the ability to help them (e.g., unlimited money, time); therefore the focus was on whether their family would help them barring external barriers. An established scale could not be located. Directions for this scales instructed people to imagine they were depressed. The four questions were: If I asked, my loved ones would help me find a solution for my depression; My loved ones would do anything to help cure my depression; If I asked, my loved ones would help me overcome depression; and My loved ones are trustworthy and wouldn't tell others about my depression. Greater scores indicated participants believed their family had a greater willingness to help them overcome

depression (Study 1: a = . 92; Study 2: a = . 91).

### Perceived familial consequences

This scale was developed specifically for this study due to a lack of an appropriate established scale and focused on perceived consequences that would ensue for their loved ones if the participant chose to seek help for depression. This scale included five questions: My loved ones would be happy if I asked them for help, My loved ones would feel ashamed of me if I asked for help for depression, My loved ones would think I was weak for asking for help for depression, My loved ones would respect me for asking for depression, and My loved ones would think I was crazy if I asked for help for depression. Greater scores indicated more positive outcome beliefs regarding familial consequences of help-seeking for depression (Study 1: α = . 88; Study 2: α = . 91).

## Self-stigma

The Self-Stigma of Depression Scale (SSDS; Barney, Griffiths, Christensen, & Jorm, 2010) was used to measure self-stigma. The 15 questions focused on individual consequences of help-seeking (e.g., Feel Ashamed, Feel inadequate around other people; Study 1: a = 84; Study 2: a = . 89). Greater scores indicated greater self-stigma.

# Demographics

Measures included gender, age, annual income, highest level of education completed, country of birth, and whether at least one parent was born in the US.

#### Statistical Analyses

All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS version 23 software. The correlations between the measures were assessed using two-tailed significance tests with alpha at .05. The data were screened according to suggestions from Tabachnick and Fidell (2007), but there were

### DEPRESSION AND HELP-SEEKING

no outliers.

To test the hypothesized mediations in Hypotheses 1, Model 4 of Hayes' (2012) PROCESS program utilizing bootstrap estimations of indirect effects was used (see Preacher, Rucker, & Hayes, 2007). Bootstrapping provides several advantages over traditional mediation analyses including: a) the ability to estimate the size of indirect effects, b) a more accurate representation of the sampling distribution for indirect effects, and c) greater statistical power when compared to other mediation statistical techniques. Gender was a sigmificant predictor and was therefore used as a covariate. Analyses were performed using 1,000 bootstrapped samples with 95% bias corrected intervals and were significant over and above the direct effect with gender as a covariate. Preacher and Kelley's (2011) relative indirect effect (PM) was used as an indicator of effect size. Preacher and Kelly note that it is the ratio of the indirect effect to the total effect and should be interpreted as the proportion of the total effect of the mediation. The distributions for all of the outcome variables were tested for the assumptions of normality. Two of the variables tested as part of the suite of help-seeking behaviors included in Hypothesis 1 were bimodal. The outcome variables for Hypotheses 1c (family could help) as well as Hypothesis 1e (perceived family consequences) were run both transformed and as continuous with the same results, therefore, we reported the results for the continuous variables.

# Results

Participants included 130 Hispanics who completed the survey and passed two attention checks. See Table 2 for sample demographics and Table 3 for correlations between measures. To test our hypothesis that PFF would mediate the relationship between depression and a suite of help-seeking behaviors, a path was the same and represented the relationship between depressive symptomatology and PFF, b(SE) = -. 61(.09), p < . 001, and indicated that elevated depressive

symptomatology significantly predicted a decreased in PFF. The b path, dependent (Y) variable, indirect path, and effect size of the indirect effect are described under each sub-hypothesis in Table 5.

Hypothesis 1a. The b path indicated that PFF significantly predicted a decrease in helpseeking self-efficacy. Together, the a, b, and indicated that PFF mediated the relationship between elevated depressive symptomatology and decreased help-seeking selfefficacy (CI [-. 35, -. 16)). The confidence intervals for the indirect effect did not include zero, thus indicating a significant indirect effect.

Hypothesis 1b. The b path indicated that PFF significantly predicted a decrease in perceived utility of familial support. Together, this indicated that PFF mediated the relationship between elevated depressive symptomatology and decreased perceived utility of familial support (CI [-. 05, -. 02].

Hypothesis 1c. The b path indicated that PFF significantly predicted a decrease in the perceptions of whether participants believed their family had the behavioral capabilities (e.g., time, money) and thereby, could help them overcome depression. Together, these results indicated that PFF mediated the relationship between elevated depressive symptomatology and the decreased perception that the participants' family could help (CI [-. 12, -. 06].

Hypothesis 1d. The b path indicated that PFF significantly predicted a decrease in the perception of whether participants believed their family would offer to help them overcome depression barring no external barriers (e.g., time, money). Together, the a, b, and indirect paths indicated that PFF mediated the relationship between elevated depressive symptomatology and decreased beliefs whether the participants' family would help (CI [-. 25, -. 11]).

Hypothesis 1e. The b path indicated that PFF significantly predicted a decrease in

### DEPRESSION AND HELP-SEEKING

perceived familial consequences. Together, the a, b, and indirect paths indicated that PFF mediated the relationship between elevated depressive symptomatology and decreased perceived familial consequences of help-seeking (CI [-. 32, -. 13]).

Hypothesis 1f. The b path indicated that PFF significantly predicted elevated self-stigma. Together, this indicated that PFF mediated the relationship between depressive elevated symptomatology and elevated self-stigma (CI [.06, .47].

# Discussion

Results of the current study are in line with the investigation it sought to replicate and expand (Keeler et al., 2013). Beginning with the associations between variables, level of depressive symptomatology and perceived family functioning were negatively associated with each other and significantly associated with all other variables included in the study (i.e., helpseeking expectations, family willingness and ability to help, familial responses to help seeking, and self-stigma; see Table 3). Moreover, perceptions of family functioning mediated the relationship between level of depressive symptomatology and all other variables of interest in the study (e.g., utility of family support, familial consequences of help seeking, self-stigma). Even though correlational, these results are in line with the proposition that it might be possible to reduce the negative impact of depression on help-seeking outcomes by changing perceptions of family functioning.

#### Study 2

The first goal of the Study 2 was to explore the generalizability of Study 1's results to Non-Hispanic Whites. Although there appear to be similarities between Hispanics and Non-Hispanic Whites regarding familial relations (Griffith et al., 2011; Vega et al., 1991), Siegel and colleagues' (2012) findings indicate that people of various cultures perceive the causes of

### DEPRESSION AND HELP-SEEKING

depression differently. Specifically, Siegel and colleagues' conducted a study whereby results indicated that even though there was a relationship between perceiving depression as a byproduct of a lack of willpower and negative affect among Non-Hispanic Whites, the same causal attributions were associated with increased levels of positive affect among Spanish-Dominant Hispanics. Put another way, an intervention that could increase positive affect among Spanish-Dominant Hispanics could lead to negative affect among Non-Hispanic Whites. Therefore, cultural differences need to be ruled out prior to planning multicultural interventions. As such, this study first sought to replicate Study 1 (H1).

Additionally, an experimental manipulation was added toward the end of the study, after the majority of measures had already been completed.. Participants were asked to engage in an autobiographical emotional memory task designed to make positive or negative examples of family functioning salient. As noted earlier, H2 predicted that the short recall task would make positive or negative occurrences of family functioning salient, thereby improving or worsening PFF. Specifically, when people with heightened depressive symptomatology engage in an autobiographic recall task focused on prior experience of family support, PFF will be increased. When people with elevated depressive symptomatology engage in an autobiographic recall task focused on prior negative experience of family support, PFF will decrease. If PFF is indeed malleable in such a way, it would offer a first step toward discerning future intervention efforts designed to increase solicitation of help from family members.

## Method

### Participants

Participants were once again recruited using MTurk. Individuals who classified themselves as Non-Hispanic Whites, were at least 18 years old, and resided in the US were

invited to participate in an anonymous 25-minute survey and earned \$.60. Interested participants were directed via a link to the survey where they completed an informed consent along with several measures. An Institutional Review Board reviewed all procedures and the study fully complied with the provisions of the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki.

# Measures

With the exception of the added manipulation, the measures used for Study 2 were identical to Study 1. Specifically, the measures included scales assessing depression (BDI-II), PFF (FAD), help-seeking self-efficacy, utility of family could offer help, family would offer help, perceived familial consequences of help-seeking, self-stigma (SSDS), and demographics.2

# Manipulation

To test H2 regarding the malleability of family functioning, participants completed a written autobiographical emotional memory task (see also Mills & D'Mello, 2014; Strack, Schwarz, & Gschneidinger 1985). Previous research provides evidence to support the use of autobiographical memory tasks for a short and easily disseminated mood induction for both the general population (e.g., Mills & D'Mello, 2014) and for people with elevated depressive symptomatology (e.g., Moore, Watts, & Williams, 1988). Participants were randomly assigned to either a betrayed/frustrated or loved condition. Those assigned to the betrayed/frustrated condition were primed to think about a time when they have felt betrayed, or frustrated by their family. Conversely, people in the loved condition were directed to think about a time when their family helped them accomplish a goal, live happily, or when their family was there when they were needed most. Participants were directed to write about the event. Additionally, participants wrote

।

<sup>2</sup> See Table 1 for means, standard deviations, and possible range of scores for all measures.

### DEPRESSION AND HELP-SEEKING

a second paragraph about the emotions they felt as the result of the incident. Those in the betrayed/frustrated condition were specifically requested to write about negative emotions while those in the loved condition were directed to write about the positive emotions they felt.

The majority of the participants put considerable time and effort into their responses. The following is an example of a response from someone in the loved condition:

My family was there for me when I was laid off from my job. I was severely depressed after it happened, but my family encouraged me and made it possible for me to go back to school and find another, better job. I felt happiness, warmth, and gratitude for my family. The following is an example of a betrayed/frustrated condition response:

A time when I felt frustrated and angered with my family was when I was 19 and I found out I was pregnant with my first child. At first, they were not at all supportive and had a very negative attitude towards the situation. They were telling me that I shouldn't have the child and that I had ruined my life and I had been stupid. I felt really hurt and unsupported. I felt like I needed them the most then and they were not there for me. It hurt me and angered me at the same time. I was really upset that they did not think I was capable of being a good mother at that time and that they had no faith in my abilities.

## Statistical Analyses

All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS version 23 software. The correlations between the measures were conducted two-tail at a .05 significance level. The data were screened according to suggestions from Tabachnick and Fidell (2007) and three multivariate outliers were removed from the analyses.

To test H1, Hayes' (2013) PROCESS program utilizing bootstrap estimations of indirect effects (Model 4) was used for all mediation analyses (see Preacher et al., 2007). Gender was a

### DEPRESSION AND HELP-SEEKING

significant predictor and was therefore used as a covariate in all analyses. Analyses were performed using 1,000 bootstrapped samples with 95% bias corrected intervals and were significant over and above the direct effect with gender as a covariate. Preacher and Kelley's (2011) relative indirect effect (PM) was used as an indicator of effect size.

For H2, Hayes's PROCESS (2013) program Model 1 was used to test the relationship between manipulation condition (betrayed/frustrated or loved), depressive symptomatology, and changes in PFF as a result of the manipulation. Analyses were performed using 11,000 bootstrapped samples with 95% bias corrected intervals with gender as a covariate.

# Results

The final sample included 124 Non-Hispanic Whites who completed the survey and responded to the experimental manipulation in accord with the instructions. See Table 2 for sample demographics and Table 4 for correlations between measures.

# Hypotheses 1

To test our hypothesis that PFF would mediate the relationship between depression and a suite of help-seeking behaviors, a path was the same and represented the relationship between depressive symptomatology and PFF, b(SE) = -. 60(.12), p < . 001, and indicated that elevated depressive symptomatology significantly predicted a decrease in PFF. The b path, dependent (Y) variable, indirect path, and effect size of the indirect effect are described under each subhypothesis in Table 5.

Hypothesis 1a. The b path indicated that PFF significantly predicted a decrease in helpseeking self-efficacy. Together, the a, b, and indicated that PFF mediated the relationship between elevated depressive symptomatology and decreased help-seeking selfefficacy (CI [-. 26, -. 08]). The confidence intervals for the indirect effect did not include zero,
### DEPRESSION AND HELP-SEEKING

thus indicating a significant indirect effect.

Hypothesis 1b. The b path indicated that PFF significantly predicted a decrease in perceived utility of familial support. Together, this indicated that PFF mediated the relationship between elevated depressive symptomatology and decreased perceived utility of familial support (CI [-. 07, -. 03].

Hypothesis 1c. The b path indicated that PFF significantly predicted a decrease in the perceptions of whether participants believed their family had the behavioral capabilities (e.g., time, money) and thereby, could help them overcome depression. Together, these results indicated that PFF mediated the relationship between elevated depressive symptomatology and the decreased perception that the participants' family could help (CI [-. 08, -. 03].

Hypothesis 1d. The b path indicated that PFF significantly predicted a decrease in the perception of whether participants believed their family would offer to help them overcome depression barring no external barriers (e.g., time, money). Together, the a, b, and indirect paths indicated that PFF mediated the relationship between elevated depressive symptomatology and decreased beliefs whether the participants' family would help (CI [-. 15, -. 06]).

Hypothesis 1e. The b path indicated that PFF significantly predicted a decrease in perceived familial consequences. Together, the a, b, and indirect paths indicated that PFF mediated the relationship between elevated depressive symptomatology and decreased perceived familial consequences of help-seeking (CI [-. 22, -. 09]).

Hypothesis 1f. The b path indicated that PFF significantly predicted elevated self-stigma. Together, this indicated that PFF mediated the relationship between depressive elevated symptomatology and elevated self-stigma (CI [.09, .37].

#### Hypothesis 2

#### DEPRESSION AND HELP-SEEKING

The second hypothesis predicted that when people with heightened depressive symptomatology engage in an autobiographic recall task focused on prior experience of family support (e.g., loved), PFF will be increased. When people with heightened depressive symptomatology engage in an autobiographic recall task focused on prior negative experience of family support (e.g., betrayed/frustrated), PFF will decrease. Accordingly, the difference between PFF scores from pre-to post-test was used as the dependent variable. The whole model accounted for 13.28% of the variance in PFF score differences, F(4, 119) = 3.180; p =.016. Controlling for the main effects and interaction between BDI-II and condition, there was a significant effect of gender, B = -2.20, SEB = .93, t(119) = -2.37, p = .020, 95% CI [-4.05, -.36] indicating that females reported a greater negative change in PFF from Time 1 to Time 2 compared to males.

As predicted, there was a significant two-way interaction between depressive symptomatology and family condition (betrayed/frustrated or loved) on changes in PFF, B =-. 13, SEB = . 05, t(119) = - 2.41, p = . 02, 95% CI [- . 24, Looking within each condition, there was no significant conditional effect of depressive symptomatology on changes in PFF for those in the betrayed/frustrated condition, 0x-x v =. 03, SE = . 03, t(119) = . 84, p = . 40, 95% CI [-. 04, .10]. However, there was a significant conditional effect of depressive symptomatology on changes in PFF for those in the loved condition, 0x-y = -. 10, SE = . 04, t(119) = - 2.52, p = . 01, 95% CI [-.18, -. 02]. Those with lower BDI-II scores reported more positive changes in PFF as a result of the loved writing task, while those with higher BDI-II scores reported more negative changes in PFF as a result of the task. Using the Johnson-Neyman technique to probe interactions, this

s This hypothesis was also analyzed used repeated measures ANOVA, with BDI-II scores split into 0-19 and 20+. The pattern of results remained the same with both analyses, so only the PROCESS model 1 results are reported, to give more detail on the effect of depressive symptomatology.

#### DEPRESSION AND HELP-SEEKING

effect of condition on PFF became statistically significant for those with BDI-II scores less than 12.21 (none to minimal depression) but for those with greater depressive symptamotology, there were no significant differences between the loved and betrayed/frustrated conditions on PFF, 0x-y = 1.61, SE = . 81, t(119) = 1.98, p = . 05, 95% CI [.00, 3.22] (see Figure 1).

#### Discussion

Study 2 had two central goals. The first was to replicate Study 1 in a sample of Non-Hispanic Whites; the second was to assess the malleability of perceived family support among people with depression. Regarding the replication of the results of Study 1, a similar pattern of results emerged. In addition to depressive symptomatology and family functioning being again associated with all variables and each other, both variables were also associated with all other variables of interest (see Table 4). Beyond the same associations being revealed, the strength of relationships are striking similar. Further, H1 was supported, as PFF partially mediated the relationship between depressive symptomatology and help-seeking self-efficacy, perceived utility of familial help-seeking, perception of whether family could help, perception of family would help, perceived familial consequences, and self-stigma.

The results of the experiment (H2) indicate there was a significant interaction between the condition (i.e., recalling experiences of familial love or recalling experiences of familial betrayal/frustration) and level of depressive symptomatology. As illustrated in Figure 1, even though the two autobiographical tasks influenced participants without depressive symptomatology as expected, and would be desired from an intervention (i.e., writing about a prior experience of feeling loved by family increased perceptions of family functioning), the same did not occur among people with heightened depressive symptomatology. The same writing task that lead participants without heightened levels of depressive symptomatology to

### DEPRESSION AND HELP-SEEKING

have more favorable views of the functioning of their families had a marginally significant effect on people with heightened depressive symptomatology such that it caused them to see their families as functioning less well.

### General Discussion

The current studies represent early additional steps in a research stream investigating whether increasing PFF among people with heightened depressive symptomatology represents a possible means of increasing familial help-seeking behavior. As preliminary steps toward assessing the potential success of such an intervention, we explored whether the negative relationship between heightened depressive symptomatology and help-seeking beliefs, as well as self-stigma, is mediated by PFF. Further, with an eye toward intervention, we began investigating whether PFF is amenable to change.

As predicted, and offering initial cross-sectional support to notion that the negative relationship between depression and familial help-seeking cognitions can possibly be minimized by increasing PFF, the negative relationship between heightened depressive symptomatology and help-seeking cognitions, as well as self-stigma, was partially mediated by PFF. An identical pattern of results was revealed regardless if the sample were Non-Hispanic Whites or Spanish-Dominant Hispanics. Even though many of the one-on-one associations between variables have been previously indicated across numerous samples, such as immigrant women in Taiwan (Yang et al., 2014), people living with HIV/AIDS in Nepal (Amiya, 2014), and Australian adults (Jorm et al., 2010), the current study is unique in proposing PFF as a partial mediator of the relationship between depression and familial help-seeking beliefs. A likely reason that the scholars have rarely considered whether PFF could be partially mediating the relationship between depression and familial help-seeking beliefs is that most scholars take the perspective that a lack of family

#### DEPRESSION AND HELP-SEEKING

functioning causes depression (e.g., Cano et al., 2016). To be sure, the possibility of a bidirectional relationship-depression changing perceptions of family functioning-has been theorized (e.g., Freed et al., 2016; Moreira & Telzer, 2015); however, it has received relatively limited attention. Although correlational, the meditational analysis is supportive of this possibility.

We now turn to our experimental assessment. We were indeed able to influence PFF among those without heightened depressive symptomatology as a result of the ""loved"" autobiographical writing task; however, the effect of the ""loved"" writing task on people with depressive symptomatology was marginally significant (p = . 05)-and in the opposite direction. For people with heightened levels of depressive symptomatology, writing about a time when a family exhibited loving, fulfilling, and helpful behavior caused a marginally significant reduction in PFF. Put another way, even though writing about a time when family was loving and helpful had a significant positive impact on people without heightened levels of depressive symptomatology, the near opposite effect occurred on those with heightened levels of depressive symptomatology.

As noted earlier, it appears that recalling a time when one felt loved and was helped by family members led people with heightened depressive symptomatology to feel guilty. Likewise, Killen and Macaskill (2015), in describing the results of a different gratitude intervention where positive outcomes were derived but gratitude scores did not change, noted, ""Alternatively, in some participants, the effect of reflecting on gratitude may have produced slightly negative effects from feelings of indebtedness that can be associated with feelings of guilt"" (p. 960; see Watkins, Scheer, Ovnicek, & Kolts, 2010 for similar reasoning). Another possibility is that participants with depressive symptomatology struggled to be able to retrieve a positive incident

#### DEPRESSION AND HELP-SEEKING

(e.g., Gibbs & Rude, 2004). Similarly Sin and colleagues (2011) note their gratitude intervention may have been somewhat problematic due to people believing they do not have much to be thankful about. We tried to avoid this problem by providing a list of different positive memories from which to draw (e.g., a time when one felt loved and fulfilled by family, when ability to accomplish goals was improved by family, when happiness was made possible by the family, or when family was there when most needed); nevertheless, an inability to think of positive incidents is possibly in part responsible for the results indicated.

These results highlight the dire challenge faced by researchers seeking to influence people with heightened depressive symptomatology. To be sure, media and education based interventions (Klimes-Dougan, Klingbeil, & Meller, 2013; Siegel et al., 2015), particularly those guided by positive psychology (e.g., Seligman, Steen, Park, & Peterson, 2005), have the potential to successfully increase the amount of help received by people with heightened depressive symptomatology. However, this is not the first study to report data indicating iatrogenic effects (i.e., negative unintended consequence) as a result of trying to influence or educate people with heightened depressive symptomatology. For example, even though some media efforts targeting people with depression have been successful, others have backfired and increased negative help-seeking attitudes (see Klimes-Dougan & Lee, 2010 for examples of both). Unfortunately, such problems are not limited to any one approach. Unintended negative effects as a result of efforts to help people with depression have also been reported in lab studies testing anti-stigma messages (Lienemann et al., 2013), a multiple week gratitude intervention (Sin et al., 2011), and a depression information website (Christensen et al., 2006).

Data from the current study illustrates the critical importance of pilot testing materials with people with heightened depressive symptomatology when such individuals represent the

#### DEPRESSION AND HELP-SEEKING

target population. For example, in the current study, the ""loved"" writing task had a positive influence on PFF only among people without heightened depressive symptomatology. If we would have tested our autobiographical recall task only on people without heightened levels of depressive symptomatology, the ""loved"" writing task might have erroneously be perceived as a useful tool for all people. The results of such an error could be deadly, as the task writing appears more likely to impair PFF than improve it among people with heightened depressive symptomatology. Similarly, Lienemann and colleagues (2013) report on an experiment where a public service announcement (PSA) seeking to reduce the stigma of depression led to increased self-stigma of help-seeking-but only among people with heightened levels of depression (see Lienemann & Siegel, 2016 for a similar finding). Even though these studies make a strong case for testing intervention materials with the intended audience (i.e., people with depression) rather than non-depressed people, such a practice still occurs but will ideally begin to cease.

### Future Directions

There are future directions specific to the potential intervention approach being explored, as well as recommendations that apply more generally to the pursuit of learning how people with depression can be influenced to seek help. In regards to the proposed intervention approach, future studies should continue to explore how PFF can be increased among people with depression. The current study indicates it is possible to influence PFF among people without depression; however, a technique for doing so among people with depression is a critical facet of the proposed approach. Approaches found to be useful at increasing the persuasive strength of people with heightened depressive symptomatology in other contexts (e.g., the overheard communication technique; Siegel et al., 2016) could be useful in this domain. However, regardless of which approach is taken, materials must be extensively pilot tested prior to

#### DEPRESSION AND HELP-SEEKING

implementation. If prior studies indicating a boomerang effect (e.g., Christensen et al., 2006; Klimes-Dougan & Lee, 2010; Sin et al., 2011) have not been enough to motivate people to extensively pilot interventions for people with depression-on people with depression-the current study will hopefully serve as the tipping point.

Beyond directly targeting people with depression, another possibility is to target family members. Efforts can seek to instruct family members to behave and communicate such that their depressed loved one's perception of family functioning is positively influenced. The family members who are not currently depressed should be easier to influence than the individual with heightened depressive symptomatology. Future studies may want to consider developing family support interventions that focus on topics similar to Stark, Banneyer, Wang, and Arora (2012) including building a supportive environment (e.g., making the individual with depression feel safe to talk), communication skills (e.g., effective listening), building family cohesion (e.g., problem solving), and modifying patterns of family interactions that can exacerbate mental health issues. Such an intervention component (i.e., how to improve social support) can be particularly useful as social support can sometimes have unintended negative outcomes (e.g., Griffiths, Crisp, Barney, & Reid, 2011; Revenson, Schiaffino, Majerovitz, & Gibofsky, 1991). By encouraging families to create a supportive environment for loved ones with depression, two goals may be accomplished. First, it will provide families with the feeling that there is something they can do to help a loved one, plus it could increase PFF among people with depression.

### Limitations

A limitation of the current study is the cross-sectional nature of some of the data collected. Due to the data's cross-sectional quality, we cannot discern whether people with heightened depressive symptomatology indeed live with families that are less cohesive, if

#### DEPRESSION AND HELP-SEEKING

depression causes family strife, or if people with depressive symptomatology are perceiving family functioning to be more problematic than it is in actuality. All are possible. For example, in support of depressive symptomatology negatively coloring perceptions of family relationships, the more depressed an adolescent becomes, the greater the discrepancy between the adolescent's perception of family functioning and their caregivers perception (Ohannessian et al., 1995).

An additional limitation is that the experimental assessment only occurred among Non-Hispanic Whites. It is possible that the same writing task could have been successful had it been implemented in a different population. Likewise, another limitation stems from the experimental manipulations being just one of many manipulations which can be used in an attempt to improve perceptions of family functioning. It is possible that a different experimental prime could have led to different results (Siegel et al., 2008). Replicating the second study using multiple examples to elicit feelings of familial love and betrayal would increase our confidence in the validity of the current results-particularly if assessed cross-culturally.

Also, even though perceptions of the utility of seeking help are predictive of indeed doing so (Hom et al., 2015), the current study did not include an explicit measure of help-seeking. A final limitation is the use of MTurk for data collection. Concern for this limitation is somewhat reduced due to the pattern of results in the current studies being akin to data collected from Spanish-Dominant Hispanics at a swap meet in Arizona (Keeler et al., 2013). Nevertheless, a useful future direction would be to conduct a similar research effort within a clinical sample. Given that a clinical sample will all have prior experience with receiving help, whether it was requested or otherwise, the relationships indicated in the current study might be amplified or curtailed.

#### Conclusion
# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

#### DEPRESSION AND HELP-SEEKING

The results of two cross-sectional meditational analyses, conducted with two different samples (i.e., Spanish-Dominant Hispanic Whites), indicate that PFF partially mediates the relationship between heightened depressive symptomatology and familial helpseeking cognitions, as well as self-stigma. These results offer further preliminary support for the possibility that increasing PFF could reduce the negative influence of depressive symptomatology on familial help-seeking cognitions. With an eye toward future intervention possibilities, we investigated whether it would be possible to influence PFF among people with heightened depressive symptomatology.

Counter to expectations, even though an autobiographical recall task focused on a time when the participant felt loved and fulfilled by family had a significant positive impact on PFF among people without heightened depressive symptomatology, the autobiographical recall task had a marginally significant (p = .05) negative impact on PFF among people with heightened depressive symptomatology. As the experiment was only conducted on the Non-Hispanic Whites, we can make no assumptions as to whether the recall task would have the same impact on people from other cultures. Overall, the cross-sectional results offer preliminary support for the proposed intervention approach (i.e., increasing PFF to reduce the negative relationship between depression and familial help-seeking cognitions), but also highlight the challenge faced by those attempting to do so. As noted earlier, success is feasible, but a greater understanding as to when success, rather than iatrogenic effect, can be expected is needed and could represent a critical contribution to science.

# Learning Climate and Job Performance among Health Workers. A Pilot Study

### Michela Cortini1\*, Monica Pivetti1\* and Sara Cervai2

1 Dipartimento di Scienze Psicologiche, della Salute e del Territorio, Università degli Studi ""G. d'Annunzio"" Chieti - Pescara, Chieti, Italy, 2 Dipartimento di Studi Umanistici, Università degli Studi di Trieste, Trieste, Italy

This paper will explore if and how psychological strain plays a mediator role between the learning climate and job performance in a group of health workers. Although the relationship between learning climate and job performance has already been explored in the international literature, the role of psychological strain, which may hamper or deepen this relationship, has yet to be investigated. The research hypothesis is that psychological strain mediates the relationship between the climate toward learning (including also the error avoidance climate) and job performance. Data were gathered in a Public hospital in Italy. Participants (N = 61) were health professionals (nurses and obstetricians). Considering the relatively small sample size, a mediation analysis with the aid of the SPSS macro PROCESS was performed. The results show that the relationship between the learning climate (specifically its dimension of organizational appreciation toward learning) and job performance is mediated by psychological strain. The future research agenda and practical implications are discussed in the paper.

# INTRODUCTION

The relationship between soft constructs (i.e., Perceived Organizational Support, Job Satisfaction, Commitment, Engagement...) and performance has received growing attention from scholars in particular, work psychology researchers – working to show the link between subjective items (perception, motivation, satisfaction) and measurable outcomes (Riggle et al., 2009).

The dimensions that refer to the psychological side of the organization are – in the common experience of any practitioner - clearly related to personal behaviors and performance, although the scientific literature still struggles to demonstrate it. International contests (e.g., Great Place To Work) are receiving more and more attention from companies, motivated first of all by the need to attract human resources (Employer Branding), and to consider the possibility of a close link between organizational wellbeing and performance.

One open question is about how to demonstrate the relationship between the performance of a whole organization and psychological dimensions such as organizational culture, climate, stress. . . Managerial studies propose considering economic indicators as proxies for soft constructs: i.e., funds dedicated to training and budget results. Moreover, there is an increasing need to focus on how psychological organizational dimensions can impact on performance.

Organizational performance is usually measured in terms of financial indicators; productivity and performance are often considered good proxies. Furthermore, specific markets and sectors required a specific focus. For instance, in education, where the proposal to measure performance

by monitoring the salary of former students, or even by means of financial indicators (ROI), is not well accepted yet, and may not be very appropriate, either.

In the healthcare sector, budget indicators are seen in terms of performance linked to health indicators: healthy people do not require treatment, so they do not cost to the community anything; recovery rates, cure rates, surgery rates, pertinence of prescription are only some examples of how the healthcare sector is used to consider costs and quantitative indicators to measure organizational performance. In this context, incidents and errors may become one of the most appropriate dimensions to analyze the link between organizational dynamics and performance in healthcare. Each incident or error in medicine contains a potential cost in terms of patient health, additional therapies, legal costs, damaged reputation, which can have a direct impact on organizational performance. On the other hand, each incident contains information regarding how to improve procedures to avoid a similar error in the future, so that it constitutes a precious source of information for the continuous improvement process. Generally speaking, errors trigger learning because negative and informative events have the potential to highlight what still needs to be changed, becoming a step in a wide organizational development (Argyris and Schön, 1978). If something changes following an error, it means the organization has learnt from it (Frese and Keith, 2015). Putz et al. (2013, p. 516) proposed a classification in four factors influencing such error- related learning processes at work, underlining that: ""While members act and learn as their organization's agents, the organization itself affects the learning processes of individuals with its routines, processes, structures and its culture."" They consist in supervisor's behavior, colleagues' behavior, task structure and procedures, principles and values. Following this rationale, Putz et al. (2013) focus their research on the climate conducive for learning from errors, seen as a multifaceted construct.

Since the error rate can be seen as performance indicator in the healthcare sector (because any error potentially causes a failure), we argue that the way errors trigger an improvement indicates, in a clear way, the organizational learning process, and its effectiveness.

To investigate which dimensions encourage or discourage this process is one of the major challenges for practitioners and researchers.

The link between HR practices and strategies, and in particular training policies, with healthcare organizations' performance has been reported by Michie et al. (2014). Moreover, the relationship between organizational support for training and performance has been well highlighted in the meta-analytic review conducted by Arthur et al. (2003).

More recently, Nikolova et al. (2014) have reviewed the organizational learning literature, and have underlined three different dimensions that occur in different studies and different contexts; the facilitation dimension (all the forms of support for learning that organizations guarantee to their employees); the dimension of rewarding and appreciation for learning, such as incentives; the dimension of error management. These dimensions have been included in the Learning Climate Scale (LCS).

To contribute to this field of research, the present study focuses on the relationship between learning climate and performance, seeking to understand the influence played by an individual dimension, particularly challenging nowadays, that is psychological strain.

In other studies (Cervai et al., 2013; Cervai and Polo, 2015) we have stressed the fact that learning is crucial for the health context, stressing the need to evaluate its outcome. In line with this attention toward learning outcome evaluation, we propose to investigate the role of the internal evaluation of learning. In particular, the research aims to explore the role played by the organizational learning climate, which can become a proxy to evaluate workplace learning.

In particular, following the work of Motowidlo et al. (1986), our attention focuses on the mediator role of psychological strain between learning climate and performance, putting forward the following hypothesis:

H1: Perceived organizational support for training and learning positively affects job performance.

H2: Appreciation from the organization for training and learning activities positively affects job performance.

H3: Error avoidance negatively affects job performance.

H4: Psychological strain mediates the relationship between support for training and learning and job performance.

H5: Psychological strain mediates the relationship between appreciation for training and learning and job performance.

H6: Psychological strain mediates the relationship between error management and job performance.

# MATERIALS AND METHODS

### Sample

Data were gathered in a Public hospital in Italy. Participants (N = 61) were full-time health professionals (nurses and obstetricians); most of them (51 participants) were female, their average age was 47.9 years (SD. 9,6), with a range between 31 and 68 years of age.

# Measures and Data Collection

A cross-sectional survey was adopted with a self-administered and anonymous questionnaire, with a first part on sociodemographic information (age, sex, contract type) and a core part related to the variables being analyzed whose description follows.

### Learning Climate

The original scales developed by Nikolova et al. (2014) were used to assess the following dimensions of the learning climate: organizational support for training (ex. ""My organization provides sufficient resources to develop my competences""), appreciation for training (e.g., ""In my organization, employees who make effort to learn new things, earn appreciation and respect"") and error avoidance (e.g., ""In my organization, one is afraid to admit mistakes""). These measures showed high Cronbach alpha reliability levels (indexes vary from 0.81 to 0.91). All the scales consist of three items where respondents express

an opinion by means of a seven-point Likert scale, representing an increasing level of agreement (from 1, ""strongly disagree"" to 7, ""strongly agree"").

### Psychological Strain

Job strain was measured with a single item of the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) focused on feelings of stress. The GHQ has a long tradition within nursing studies (e.g., Hunter and Houghton, 1993; Fagin et al., 1995; Jones and Johnston, 1997; Tully, 2004; Gomes et al., 2013). Furthermore, in the past, the GHQ was used as a simple tool for detecting the prevalence of psychological stress within general medical practice (Werneke et al., 2000). Several versions of the GHQ exist: 60-, 30-, 28-, and 12-item scales. GHQ-12 is perhaps the most popular version of the questionnaire, very often used in large social surveys (Banks and Jackson, 1982; Winefield et al., 1989) or applied contexts (Tully, 2004), owing to its brevity.

The choice of the single item was driven by a cost and time rationale, especially in view of the fact that we had collected data inside the working context, in the time between shifts. The choice to replace longer measurement scales with a single measure is not a novelty in the international literature and it seems to be particularly efficient for the working environment, showing a satisfactory content validity (see, Elo et al., 2003). We have preferred the single item taken from the GHQ (""Have you experienced stress during the past 2 weeks?"", measured by a fourpoint scale, ranging from 1, ""better than usual,"" to 4, ""Much less than usual""), instead of the one derived from the Occupational Stress Questionnaire (Elo and Leppänen, 1999), because the latter includes an introduction (""Stress means a situation in which a person feels tense, restless, nervous or anxious or is unable to sleep at night because his/her mind is troubled all the time. Do you feel this kind of stress these days?"") that might, in our opinion, risk confusing the respondents. We believe that nowadays people are so used to talking about stress that they do not need any kind of detailed explanation to understand whether they are experiencing stress or not.

### Job Performance

Finally, in line with the most recent research in work and organizational psychology (e.g., Demerouti et al., 2005), we have decided to use a self-rated job performance measure, adopting two items from Chirumbolo and Areni (2005). The first item was ""I have achieved all my job goals in the last 6 months"" to which participants had to declare their agreement/disagreement

| Error Avoidance                        | 0.119 | 0.203 | 0.060    |
| F = 14.22***                           |       |       |          |
| R2 = 0.42                              |       |       |          |

(1 = strongly disagree; 9 = strongly agree). The second item was ""In the last 6 months, your job performance was:"" to which participants had to answer using a five-point scale ranging from 1 = particularly low, to 9 = particularly high.

We have decided to use self-reported measures of the main study dimensions, since we focused on perceived job characteristics (job satisfaction, as well as learning climate), as many other researchers have done (Chan, 2009; Judge et al., 2000), ""making self-reports the theoretically most relevant measure method"" (Conway and Lance, 2010, p. 329).

# RESULTS

None of the demographic variables related to any of the study variables so they were excluded from further analysis. Table 1 presents the preliminary analysis of the dataset: the means, standard deviations and inter-correlations of the main study variables.

Firstly, scaled variables achieved good reliability, with Cronbach's alpha coefficients between 0.76 and 0.91.

### Test Hypotheses

In order to test H1, H2, and H3 we performed a multiple linear regression, to predict job performance based on the three different dimensions of the Learning Climate: organizational support for training, appreciation for training and error avoidance. Preliminary analysis was performed to ensure there was no violation of the assumption of normality, linearity and multicollinearity.

A significant regression equation was found: F(1,59) = 14,22; p < 0.001, with an R2 = 0.42.

![](_page_3_Figure_2.jpeg)

Only organizational support and training appreciation were significant predictors (Table 2) of job satisfaction for apprentices.

We decided to go further and test, using three independent mediation models, the power of psychological strain to mediate the relationship between all the learning climate dimensions and job performance.

# Mediation Analysis

There are two different methods for performing mediation analyses: Multiple Regression and Structural Equations Models (SEM). Although some researchers (Baron and Kenny, 1986; Hoyle and Smith, 1994; Kenny et al., 1998) suggest adopting SEM because it allows for a better control of measurement error and gives good information about the fit of the model, we follow the guidelines of those (Holmbeck, 1997; Frazier et al., 2004) who suggest using Multiple Regression in case of a small sample size, as in the present study.

We tested the hypotheses following the guidelines described by Preacher and Hayes (2004), who developed an SPSS macro, called PROCESS, that triangulates the normal theory approach (i.e., the Sobel test), a bootstrap approach, and Baron and Kenny's (1986) approach to measure the indirect effects of the predictor on the dependent variable. In particular, the use of bootstrapped confidence intervals was necessary in order to avoid problems related to our limited sample size (MacKinnon et al., 2004; Preacher et al., 2007) and to take into consideration also the potential mediation for the dimension of error avoidance, which definitely seems interesting for this research, and it is not among the significant predictors of job performance in the present regression analysis.

We performed three different mediation analyses for each of the dimensions of the Learning Climate, with the aid of the macro PROCESS, using model n. 4.

First, it was found that psychological strain significantly mediated the relation between appreciation for training and job satisfaction (Figure 1) (indirect effect = 0.112, SE = 0.108, 95% CI [0.0109,0.2840]); since zero is not in the 95% confidence interval we can conclude that the indirect effect is significantly different from zero at p < 0.05, and that, as predicted, change in

psychological strain mediates the relationship between training support and job satisfaction.

The mediator could account for an almost 10% of the effect; PM = 0.11; K2 = 0.07, CI [0.0110,0.1875]).

Even if the role of mediator is not crucial as it would be in a totally mediated output, the interactive force between stress and valorization of learning and training is worth underlining, which suggests to HR managers the importance of taking into account nurses' training needs.

It was also found that psychological strain did not significantly mediate the relationship between organizational support for training and job performance or the relationship between error avoidance and job performance.

# DISCUSSION

First of all, the regression analysis clearly underlined the dimension of learning as being crucial in terms of performance. Learning, in this sense, has to be understood not only as something that happens at an individual level but rather as something involving employer responsibilities. In particular, the Climate for Learning underlines that, on the one hand, giving support for training and learning and, on the other hand, valuing the learning activities and efforts made by every single worker, is something vital (we suppose in both instrumental and motivational terms) for performance development.

In addition, the significant mediation model provides support for the prediction that nurses experience differences in job performance due to their different levels of psychological stress and the valorization they perceive they receive from their organization. Consequently, these results suggest a series of guidelines for HR managers, who should develop specific training plans and seek to appreciate every single learning outcome, with relentless attention paid to the wellbeing and stress of their employees: in line with other scholars (Montani et al., 2015; Giorgi et al., 2015) we claim for a supervisors' empowering management practices

In terms of additional practical implications, notwithstanding the importance of both learning and training, on the one hand,

and stress and well-being, on the other one, we trust the potential of learning and training activities focused on stress management. Stress management, generally being paid for by the employees is not sufficiently promoted within organizations. In terms of primary prevention, we wonder about the role of specific devices and tools (think to the organizational gym) to prevent psychological strain; something that could play a role on performance.

Finally, our results may corroborate the proposals for HR managers we have put forward in other studies (Cortini, 2016), stressing the role of organizational support in order to develop a sense of self as worker; in such a sense, employers ought to provide participatory practices to discuss work-related issues together along with proper error management that allow errors to become a form of learning.

# LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH

The results of the present study should be seen in the light of some limitations. First of all, our study has a cross-sectional design, which limits our capability to extrapolate the causal relationship between the variables under investigation. Especially in view of the recent criticism cross-sectional mediation analysis has received (e.g., Maxwell and Cole, 2007; Mitchell and Maxwell, 2013), we plan to collect longitudinal data to be analyzed by a Continuous Time Mediation, as suggested by Deboeck and Preacher (2016) in order to respond to the limit of mediation models in terms of time-lag analysis.

Furthermore, we have used a small sample size, which should definitely be enlarged. Specifically, our data were collected in a single Italian hospital; it would be necessary to collect additional data, also qualitative in nature, so as to deepen both the relationships we did find significant as well as those we did not find to be significant (but still showing a trend in the hypothesized direction). In addition, with a larger sample it may be easier to check for differences in formal and informal learning, as done by other scholars (Kyndt et al., 2009; Manuti et al., 2015).

We have decided to focus on self-rated performance; it would be interesting in the upcoming future to detail performance and to distinguish between adaptive performance and task performance, in line with recent literature trends (Shoss et al., 2012; Jundt et al., 2015).

Finally, taking into consideration our results, we suggest a venue for future studies that will allow for a greater understanding of the processes of workplace learning in the health context. In particular, these recommendations include further investigation of the different roles the managers and the organizational climate may play, as well as assessing the potential outcomes at both organizational and patient levels.

Objective: The goal of this study was to investigate treatment outcome and mediators of cognitive-behavioral group therapy (CBGT) versus mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) versus waitlist (WL) in patients with generalized social anxiety disorder (SAD). Method: One hundred eight unmedicated patients (55.6% female; mean age = 32.7 years, SD = 8.0; 43.5% Caucasian, 39% Asian, 9.3% Hispanic, 8.3% other) were randomized to CBGT versus MBSR versus WL and completed assessments at baseline, posttreatment/WL, and at 1-year follow-up, including the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale-Self-Report (primary outcome; Liebowitz, 1987) as well as measures of treatment-related processes. Results: Linear mixed model analysis showed that CBGT and MBSR both produced greater improvements on most measures compared with WL. Both treatments yielded similar improvements in social anxiety symptoms, cognitive reappraisal frequency and self-efficacy, cognitive distortions, mindfulness skills, attention focusing, and rumination. There were greater decreases in subtle avoidance behaviors following CBGT than MBSR. Mediation analyses revealed that increases in reappraisal frequency, mindfulness skills, attention focusing, and attention shifting, and decreases in subtle avoidance behaviors and cognitive distortions, mediated the impact of both CBGT and MBSR on social anxiety symptoms. However, increases in reappraisal self-efficacy and decreases in avoidance behaviors mediated the impact of CBGT (vs. MBSR) on social anxiety symptoms. Conclusions: CBGT and MBSR both appear to be efficacious for SAD. However, their effects may be a result of both shared and unique changes in underlying psychological processes.

What is the public health significance of this article? This study suggests that both CBT and MBSR are efficacious treatments for adults with social anxiety disorder, with equivalent outcome 1-year posttreatment.

Keywords: social anxiety, cognitive-behavioral therapy, mindfulness, meditation, mediators

Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is highly prevalent (lifetime prevalence rate of 12.1%; Kessler et al., 2005) and has an early onset that often precedes the onset of other anxiety disorders, substance use, and

major depression (Otto et al., 2001). SAD is associated with significant impairment in social, educational, and occupational functioning (Acarturk, de Graaf, van Straten, ten Have, & Cuijpers, 2008), and entails a substantial personal and societal burden (Acarturk et al., 2009; Patel, Knapp, Henderson, & Baldwin, 2002).

Although SAD is highly persistent when untreated (Blanco et al., 2011), several psychological interventions have been shown to reliably reduce social anxiety symptoms. For example, a recent meta-analysis of 32 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of cognitive and/or behavioral interventions for SAD (N = 1,479) showed superior effects on social anxiety symptoms relative to waitlist (WL; Cohen's d = 0.86), psychological placebo (d = 0.34), and pill-placebo (d = 0.36; Powers, Sigmarsson, & Emmelkamp, 2008), with treatment gains maintained at follow-up (d = 0.76). Interestingly, there were no significant differences among combined exposure and cognitive therapy (vs. control: d = 0.68), exposure (vs. control: d = 0.89), and cognitive treatments (vs. control: d = 0.80). In addition, no significant differences were observed for group (d = 0.68) versus individual (d = 0.69)

treatments. Effect sizes were not associated with sample size, publication year, or number of hours of treatment, further supporting the reliable and robust effects of cognitive and behavioral therapies for SAD.

Other more recent studies have shown the efficacy of nontraditional therapies, such as mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR). For example, a recent meta-analysis (Hofmann, Sawyer, Witt, & Oh, 2010) showed that mindfulness-based interventions reliably reduced anxiety symptoms across a variety of psychiatric and medical populations (Hedges' g = 0.63), and even more so in the subgroup of patients with anxiety and mood disorders (g = 0.97). In adults with SAD, MBSR has demonstrated improvement in mood, functioning, social anxiety, and quality of life (Koszycki, Benger, Shlik, & Bradwejn, 2007), as well as self-esteem, negative self-views, trait anxiety, negative emotional reactivity, and depression (Goldin & Gross, 2010; Goldin, Ziv, Jazaieri, & Gross, 2012; Goldin, Ziv, Jazaieri, Hahn, & Gross, 2013). A recent review (Norton, Abbott, Norberg, & Hunt, 2015) concluded that mindfulness- and acceptance-based treatments significantly reduce social anxiety symptoms, but that methodological weaknesses strongly limit inferences and comparisons with gold-standard psychosocial interventions for SAD, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT).

It is important to further examine the comparative efficacy of CBT and MBSR, and to determine whether they produce their effects through similar or different psychological mechanisms of action. To date, few studies have directly addressed whether CBT and MBSR (or similar treatments) have comparable efficacy for treatment of SAD. One study compared cognitive-behavioral group therapy (CBGT; n = 27) to MBSR (n = 26) in patients with SAD. CBGT and MBSR were comparable in improving mood, functioning, and quality of life, but CBGT produced significantly greater improvement in social anxiety symptoms, as well as greater response and remission rates (Koszycki et al., 2007). However, inferences from this study are somewhat constrained because of methodological issues, including no control group, inclusion of measurement of treatment adherence, or measurement of follow-up outcomes, and inclusion of patients with concurrent use of psychotropic medications, and unequal duration of treatment. A recent RCT compared CBGT (n = 53) with mindfulness and acceptance-based group therapy (MAGT; n = 53) and to a WL control group (n = 31) (Kocovski, Fleming, Hawley, Huta, & Antony, 2013). MAGT combined abbreviated mindfulness exercises from mindfulnessbased cognitive therapy (MBCT; Teasdale, Segal, & Williams, 1995), experiential and didactic components of acceptance and commitment therapy (Hayes, Strosahl, & Wilson, 1999), and insession and in vivo exposure exercises. Both interventions were more efficacious than WL, but not different from each other in reducing social anxiety symptoms or scores on most of the secondary outcome variables. A different RCT compared individual CBT (n = 40) with individual acceptance and commitment therapy (n = 34) and to a WL control group (n = 26), and found a similar pattern of greater efficacy for both treatments than WL and no differential treatment effect on multiple indices of social anxiety (Craske et al., 2014). However, potential confounds include permitting participants with concurrent use of psychotropic medications and alternative (i.e., noncognitive or behavioral) psychotherapies.

Far less is known about the mechanisms of action of CBT and MBSR. Investigations of potential mechanisms of change during CBT for SAD have identified probability bias for negative social events (Smits, Rosenfield, McDonald, & Telch, 2006), estimated probability and estimated cost of negative social events, safety behaviors (Hoffart, Borge, Sexton, & Clark, 2009), and anticipated aversive social outcomes (Hofmann, 2004). Formal mediation analyses indicate that decreases in maladaptive interpersonal beliefs (Boden et al., 2012) and negative cognitions (Niles et al., 2014), as well as increases in cognitive reappraisal (Kocovski, Fleming, Hawley, Ho, & Antony, 2015), reappraisal success (Goldin et al., 2014), reappraisal self-efficacy (Goldin, Ziv, Jazaieri, Werner, et al., 2012), and positive self-views (Goldin, Jazaieri, Ziv, et al., 2013), mediate the effect of CBT on social anxiety symptoms. Other research has implicated rumination, specifically, the brooding subtype, as an important predictor of changes in social anxiety during CBT for SAD (Brozovich et al., 2015). Comparable studies of the mechanisms of action of mindfulnessbased treatments are less plentiful. However, a recent metaanalysis of meditation studies examined the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of MBSR and MBCT on psychological functioning and well-being (Gu, Strauss, Bond, & Cavanagh, 2015). This analysis found strong evidence for cognitive and emotional reactivity (stress reactivation of negative thinking and emotional patterns); moderate evidence for mindfulness, rumination, and worry; and preliminary but insufficient evidence for self-compassion and psychological flexibility as mediators of outcome. However, the authors state that most of the reviewed studies had key methodological shortcomings and highlight the need for more rigorous investigation of mediators of MBSR and MBCT, particularly given the recent emphasis on attention control, emotion regulation, self-awareness, and self-regulation as key variables (Tang, Hölzel, & Posner, 2015).

# The Present Study

Our goals in this RCT of CBGT versus MBSR (vs. WL) were to examine (a) differential efficacy and durability of effect of CBGT versus MBSR on social anxiety symptoms (primary outcome) as well as measures of treatment-related processes, and (b) potential mediators of changes in social anxiety symptoms in patients with generalized SAD.

Hypothesis 1 (Outcomes): We expected greater statistical and clinically significant improvement on the primary outcome (social anxiety symptoms) for (a) both CBGT and MBSR (vs. WL), and (b) for CBGT (vs. MBSR) immediately and 1-year posttreatment.

Hypothesis 2 (Mediators): We expected that changes in cognitive reappraisal frequency and self-efficacy, subtle avoidance, and cognitive distortions would mediate the impact of CBGT versus WL, and that changes in mindfulness skills, attention focusing, attention shifting, and rumination would mediate the impact of MBSR versus WL on social anxiety symptoms immediately posttreatment. We further explored whether any of these variables differed in their mediational effect for CBGT versus MBSR.

# Method

# Participants

Patients met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed., text rev .; DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000) criteria for a principal diagnosis of generalized SAD based on the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for the DSM-IV: Lifetime version (ADIS-IV-L; Di Nardo, Brown, & Barlow, 1994). Patients met criteria for the ""generalized"" subtype of SAD if they endorsed greater than moderate social fear in five or more distinct social situations assessed by the ADIS-IV-L. Furthermore, participants had to achieve a score greater than 60 on the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale-Self-Report (LSAS-SR), the cutoff score for the generalized subtype of SAD as determined by receiver operator characteristics analysis of the LSAS-SR (Rytwinski et al., 2009). Participants were excluded for pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy during the past year; participation in CBT for any anxiety disorder during the last 2 years; any previous MBSR course; previous participation in long-term meditation retreats; history of regular mediation practice of 10 min or more three or more times per week; history of neurological disorders, cardiovascular disorders, thought disorders, or bipolar disorder; as well as current substance and alcohol abuse or dependence.

From 2012 to 2014, 724 potential participants completed an online screener, of whom 307 were screened by telephone (see Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials, Figure 1). The 173 who were potentially eligible were administered the ADIS-IV-L in person to determine whether they met diagnostic inclusion/exclusion criteria. After 65 patients were excluded because they did not meet diagnostic criteria or failed to complete baseline assessments,

the remaining 108 patients were randomly assigned to CBGT (n = 36), MBSR (n = 36), or WL (n = 36). Dropout from treatment was low and did not differ, x2(2, N = 108) = 1.05, p = . 59, across CBGT (n = 2; 6%), MBSR (n = 3; 8%), and WL (n = 1; 3%).

# Procedure

Potential patients were recruited through clinician referrals and community listings. After passing a telephone screening, a faceto-face diagnostic interview was used to determine current and past Axis I psychiatric disorders and current clinician-rated severity. After completing all baseline assessments, each set of six consecutive patients entered one group (CBGT, MBSR, or WL), which were sequenced randomly so that at the end of the study we had six groups of six patients each who were randomized to CBGT, MBSR, or WL. Patients completed assessments again at posttreatment and every 3 months during the 1-year follow-up. Patients received treatment at no cost and \$150 for completing the 1-year follow-up behavioral session. All participants provided informed consent in accordance with the institutional review board

#### Diagnostic Assessment

Diagnostic interviews were conducted at baseline using the ADIS-IV-L (Di Nardo et al., 1994). The ADIS-IV-L has demonstrated excellent interrater reliability (Brown, Di Nardo, Lehman, & Campbell, 2001) and provides clinician-rated severity for each assigned diagnosis on a 0 to 8 scale. To assess the interrater reliability of the ADIS-IV-L, we had doctoral clinical psychologists and doctoral students review 20% of the interviews. There

was 100% agreement with the original principal diagnosis of SAD (κ = 1.0).

#### Measures

Primary outcome measure. Severity of social anxiety symptoms was assessed with the LSAS-SR (Fresco et al., 2001; Liebowitz, 1987), which assesses patients' reactions to 11 social interaction situations and 13 performance situations. A 4-point Likert-type scale is used for ratings of fear and of avoidance, with a range from 0 (none and never, respectively) to 3 (severe and usually, respectively) for each situation during the past week. Ratings are summed for a total LSAS-SR score (range = 0 to 144). The LSAS-SR has good reliability and construct validity (Rytwinski et al., 2009), and its internal consistency was excellent in this study (Cronbach's alpha = . 92).

Treatment-related processes. For CBGT, we assessed four candidate mechanisms. We measured cognitive reappraisal frequency and cognitive reappraisal self-efficacy with an extended version of the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (Goldin, Manber-Ball, Werner, Heimberg, & Gross, 2009; Gross & John, 2003). The instrument utilizes a 7-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree), and includes eight items assessing cognitive reappraisal frequency and eight items assessing cognitive reappraisal self-efficacy. Internal consistency for cognitive reappraisal frequency (α = . 89) and cognitive reappraisal self-efficacy (α = .93) were good at baseline. We measured subtle avoidance using the Subtle Avoidance Frequency Examination (Cuming et al., 2009), a 32-item measure of safety behaviors. It has good discriminant and construct validity in patients with SAD, and internal consistency was good in this study at baseline (α = . 91). We measured cognitive distortions using the Cognitive Distortions Questionnaire (CD-Quest; De Oliveira, 2015), which is comprised of 15 items that assess the frequency and intensity of a variety of common cognitive errors. The CD-Quest has shown good internal consistency (as = . 83 to .86) and convergent validity with self-report measures of depression, anxiety, and automatic thoughts (rs = .51 to .65; De Oliveira, 2015; Morrison et al., 2015). Internal consistency was excellent in this study at baseline (a = . 91).

For MBSR, we assessed four candidate mechanisms. We measured mindfulness skills using the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (Baer, Smith, Hopkins, Krietemeyer, & Toney, 2006), a 39-item self-report measure of five mindfulness factors: Observing, Describing, Acting With Awareness, Nonreactivity to Inner Experience, and Nonjudging of Inner Experience. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale. The instrument has good internal consistency in general (Baer et al., 2006), and it was excellent in this study at baseline (α = .91). We used the Attentional Control Scale (Derryberry & Reed, 2002) to measure attention focusing (nine items) and shifting (10 items). Internal consistency is good for the Focusing subscale (α = .82) and acceptable for the Shifting subscale (α = .68; Ólafsson et al., 2011). In this study, internal consistency was good for both subscales (Focusing a = . 85; Shifting a = . 74).

We used the Brooding subscale of the Ruminative Responses Scale (Treynor et al., 2003) to examine this maladaptive form of rumination. Brooding is depicted as moody rumination or ""a passive comparison of one's current situation with some unachieved standard"" (Treynor et al., 2003, p. 256). Five items are rated on Likert-type scales ranging from 1 (almost never) to 4 (almost always). The Brooding subscale has been shown to have good reliability in other studies (α = .77; Treynor et al., 2003), as well as in the current study (α = . 76).

# CBT

CBGT was delivered by two doctoral clinical psychologists trained by Richard Heimberg to implement his CBGT for SAD protocol (Heimberg & Becker, 2002). Groups of six individuals met for 12 sessions of 2.5 hr each (total time = 30 hr). The participants also used selected portions of the client workbook developed by Hope, Heimberg, and Turk (2010) to supplement relevant portions of the protocol. The treatment comprised four major components: (a) psychoeducation and orientation to CBGT; (b) cognitive restructuring skills; (c) graduated exposure to feared social situations, within session and as homework; and (d) relapse prevention and termination. Further details are available elsewhere (Heimberg & Becker, 2002).

# MBSR

MBSR followed the standard curriculum outline compiled in 1993 by Jon Kabat-Zinn, except that the 1-day meditation retreat was converted to four additional weekly group sessions between the standard Class 6 and 7 so that there were 12 weekly 2.5-hr sessions. This was done to match the CBGT protocol in duration and time. The MBSR intervention was delivered by a University of Massachusetts Center for Mindfulness certified MBSR instructor with more than 30 years of teaching experience. To support the practice, each participant was given A Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Workbook (Stahl & Goldstein, 2010), which includes descriptions of mindfulness exercises together with prerecorded audio files to support ongoing practice.

# Adherence and Treatment Completer Status

To assure treatment adherence, a trained rater was present in every CBGT and MBSR session to conduct real-time rating of adherence using adherence scales developed for CBGT and for MBSR. Adherence ratings indicated that the CBGT therapists and MBSR instructor were ""in protocol"" (rating >4 of 5 for each session) with no between-groups differences, t(11) = 0.83, p = .43, in adherence for CBGT (M ± SD = 4.92 ± 0.27) versus MBSR (M ± SD = 4.81 ± 0.17). Based on a criterion of nine of 12 sessions attended for treatment completer status, 33 (92%) patients completed CBGT and 33 (92%) completed MBSR. Mean number of sessions attended for CBGT (M ± SD = 10.47 ± 1.56) and MBSR (M ± SD = 10.37 ± 2.09) were not significantly different, t(71) = 0.22, p = .82. The mean number of in-session exposures per patient in CBGT was 4.5 (SD = 0.84).

# Statistical Analyses

Outcomes. All results were analyzed using an intention-totreat approach based on treatment assignments. Longitudinal analysis was used to assess change over time and relate the changes to treatment group assignment. We implemented linear mixed-effects models (LMMs) for continuous outcomes in SPSS (Version 22) with the MIXED procedure to examine change pre versus post-CBGT versus MBSR, CBGT versus WL, and MBSR versus WL, with maximum likelihood as the method of estimation. The parameters of main interest were the fixed effect interaction terms between groups and times, describing whether the patients had differential change from pre- to posttreatment groups. The model included random intercepts and identity covariance structure. We report effect sizes as Cohen's d (Cohen, 1988), computed as the mean difference divided by the pooled standard deviation of the difference score. Cohen's d for paired sample statistical tests (e.g., within-groups t tests comparing baseline with posttreatment) was computed as the mean difference divided by the standard deviation of the difference score.

To determine clinically significant improvement, we computed reliable change (RC) and clinically significant change (CSC) for the primary outcome measure (LSAS-SR). RC was computed as 1.96 × standard error of change, which resulted in a criterion of reduction in LSAS-SR greater than 13.83. CSC consists of RC plus a shift from dysfunctional to the functional range. Using Jacobson's Method C (Jacobson, Roberts, Berns, & McGlinchey, 1999; Jacobson & Truax, 1991), the CSC criterion was determined by an LSAS-SR score lower than the halfway point (47.68) between two standard deviations above the mean of nonanxious healthy adults (M ± SD = 14.35 ± 12.7; Fresco et al., 2001) and two standard deviations below the baseline mean of SAD patients (M ± SD = 90.89 ± 17.64) measured in this study.

Mediation. We implemented mediation models to investigate mediators (M) of the effects of treatment group (G) on treatment outcome (O), namely, residualized social anxiety symptoms (LSAS-SR) immediately following treatment/WL. We investigated four putative CBT-related mediators (reappraisal frequency, reappraisal self-efficacy, subtle avoidance, cognitive distortions) as well as four putative MBSR-related mediators (mindfulness skills, attention focusing, attention shifting, and rumination), computed as residualized scores. We used Hayes's (2013) SPSS MEDIATE macro, which uses ordinary least squares regression to estimate direct (impact of G on O) and indirect (impact of G on O through M) effects, and allows analysis of three groups simultaneously when coded as categorical variables. Statistical significance was determined at p < . 05 if the 95% bias-corrected percentile bootstrapped confidence interval (with 5,000 resamples) of the indirect effect point estimate did not contain zero (see Hayes, 2013). Effect size for the mediation effect (PM) is the ratio of the indirect effect (a""b) to the total effect c = a""b + c' (Preacher & Kelley, 2011; Wen & Fan, 2015).

#### Results

# Preliminary Analyses

The three groups did not differ significantly (all ps > .05) in gender, age, education, ethnicity, marital status, income, current or past Axis I comorbidity, past psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy, age at SAD symptom onset, and years since symptom onset (see Table 1).

#### Treatment Effects on Social Anxiety Symptoms

LMMs revealed significantly greater reduction (all ts > 5.36, all ps < .001) of social anxiety symptoms (LSAS-SR) for CBGT (raw

score change from baseline = - 44; percent change from baseline level = 48%; Cohen's d = 1.56) and MBSR (-36.5; 40%; d = 1.43) compared with WL (-12.5; 14%). However, there were no significant differences for CBGT versus MBSR (t = 1.36, df = 68, p = . 18), indicating similar treatment efficacy. Furthermore, to examine the durability of clinical improvement, we tested whether there was equivalent maintenance of reduced social anxiety symptoms from immediately to 1-year posttreatment. An LMM showed no significant differences (t = 1.63, df = 52, p = . 11), suggesting similar sustained clinical improvement during the 1-year post-CBGT and MBSR period (see Figure 2).

Clinically significant improvement was defined as having occurred for patients who met criteria for both reliable change (LSAS reduction >14 points) and clinically significant change (LSAS-SR score <48 at posttreatment). Immediately posttreatment or WL, compared with WL (11.1%), CBGT (44.4%), x2(1, N = 72) = 9.97, p = . 002, Φ = . 37, and MBSR (38.9%), χ2(1, Ν = 72) = 7.41, p = . 006, @ = . 32, yielded higher rates of clinically significant improvement, but did not differ significantly from each other, x2(1, N = 72) = 0.23, p = . 63, Φ = . 06.

#### CBGT- and MBSR-Related Psychological Processes

CBGT-related processes. For cognitive reappraisal frequency, LMMs demonstrated significantly greater increases (all ts > 2.60, all ps < .05) for CBGT (+1.1; 30%, d = 0.59) and for MBSR (+1.2; 33%; d = 0.71) compared with WL (+0.4; 10%), with no significant CBGT versus MBSR differences (t = 0.04, df = 59, p = . 97; Table 2). For cognitive reappraisal self-efficacy, LMMs demonstrated significantly greater increases (all ts > 2.24, ps < . 05) for CBGT (+1.4; 40%; d = 1.05) and for MBSR (+0.8; 22%; d = 0.58) compared with WL (+0.2; 5%), with no significant CBGT versus MBSR difference (t = 1.77, df = 56, p = . 08). For subtle avoidance behaviors, LMMs demonstrated significantly greater decreases (all ts > 2.59, all ps < . 05) for CBGT (-20.1; 24%; d = 1.27) and for MBSR (-9.8; 12%; d = 0.64) compared with WL (-1; 1%), and significantly greater decreases for CBGT versus MBSR (t = 2.30, df = 66, p = . 025).

#### Mediators of CBGT and MBSR Effects

As shown in Table 3, increases in reappraisal frequency, mindfulness skills, attention focusing, and attention shifting, as well as decreases in safety behaviors and cognitive distortions, each mediated the effect of CBGT versus WL and MBSR versus WL on social anxiety symptoms. Increases in reappraisal self-efficacy and decreases in rumination mediated the effect of CBGT versus WL, but not MBSR versus WL. For the contrast of the two interventions, there was evidence that increases in reappraisal self-efficacy and decreases in safety behaviors mediated the effect of CBGT (vs. MBSR) on social anxiety symptom reduction.

# Discussion

The goals of this study were to investigate the comparative effects of CBGT versus MBSR (vs. WL) on treatment outcome, and to test for mediators of responses to CBGT and MBSR in adults with SAD. CBGT and MBSR resulted in significant reduction in social anxiety symptoms (LSAS-SR) compared with WL. Thus, the prediction that CBGT would result in greater reduction in social anxiety symptoms compared with MBSR was not supported, either immediately or 1-year posttreatment. Furthermore, analysis of reliable and clinically significant change on the LSAS-SR showed similar rates of clinically significant improvement for CBGT and MBSR. These results converge with the results of a study reporting equivalent impact of CBGT versus MAGT on social anxiety and secondary outcomes (Kocovski et al., 2013), but diverge from a prior finding of greater reduction in

social anxiety symptoms for CBGT versus MBSR (Koszycki et al., 2007). The use of more refined methods in our RCT, including matching CBGT and MBSR dose, excluding concurrent psychotropic medication use, and confirming protocol adherence, may have contributed to the equivalent efficacy of the two treatments. This pattern of results suggests that MBSR may be as efficacious as CBGT at reducing social anxiety symptoms and maintaining treatment gains.

Measures of treatment-related psychological processes provided additional evidence for similar effects of CBGT and MBSR, specifically, decreasing cognitive distortions and rumination, and increasing reappraisal frequency and self-efficacy, mindfulness skills, and attention focusing and shifting. These results are contrary to our hypotheses of greater clinical impact for CBGT versus MBSR. The only differential improvement was greater reduction in the frequency of subtle avoidance behaviors after CBGT (vs. MBSR). Safety behaviors are considered to maintain social anxiety in persons with SAD (Piccirillo, Dryman, & Heimberg, in press). CBT explicitly discusses the role of avoidance, as well as trains patients to counter avoidance by engaging in, and vicariously learning from, multiple exposures to feared situations. The frequency of safety behaviors has previously been shown to decrease more following CBT compared with a stress management control (Cuming et al., 2009). Unlike CBT, MBSR does not explicitly address safety behaviors and, specifically, avoidance behaviors.

One unexpected finding was the similar level of improvement after MBSR and CBGT in cognitive distortions, reappraisal frequency and reappraisal self-efficacy. Across studies of mindfulness meditation, there is preliminary evidence for improvement in cognitive distortions (Sears & Kraus, 2009) and increases in mindfulness and emotion regulation, as well as decreases in avoidance of emotional experience (Chiesa, Anselmi, & Serretti, 2014). Overall, the pattern of changes found in this study suggests more similarity then differences for the impact of CBGT and MBSR in adults with SAD.

With regard to mediation, increases in reappraisal frequency, mindfulness skills, and attention focusing and shifting, as well as

decreases in subtle avoidance and cognitive distortions, each mediated the effect of CBGT versus WL, and also MBSR versus WL, on social anxiety symptoms. These mediation results suggest multiple shared psychological mechanisms of change for both CBT and MBSR that span attention, cognitive, and behavioral processes. In contrast, reappraisal self-efficacy and subtle avoidance differentially mediated the impact of CBT (vs. MBSR) on social anxiety symptoms. This result converges with a prior RCT study in which increases in reappraisal self-efficacy mediated the effect of individual CBT for SAD on social anxiety symptoms (Goldin, Ziv, Jazaieri, Werner, et al., 2012). One explanation of this mediation result is that CBT provides challenging but safe opportunities to face long-held social fears in the context of in-session and in vivo exposures. The shift in metacognition, namely, awareness of and belief in one's ability to use reappraisal effectively when needed (i.e., reappraisal self-efficacy), is a fundamental learning lesson in CBT and likely contributes to social anxiety symptom reduction.

Decreases in subtle avoidance and cognitive distortions both mediated the impact of CBGT and MBSR (vs. WL). Avoidance and cognitive distortions have been found to be mediators of CBT for SAD (Hedman et al., 2013; Smits et al., 2006) and accords with cognitive-behavioral models of SAD. What is more novel is that reductions in avoidance and cognitive distortion mediated the impact of MBSR at the same level of CBGT. One key component of MBSR training that may account for the reduction in avoidance behaviors is the emphasis on radical acceptance of experience. Although there is one study showing evidence for cognitive distortions as a mediator of mindfulness-based interventions (Gu et al., 2015), it is not yet clear whether CBT and MBSR arrive at reduction in cognitive distortions via different underlying mechanisms

Contrary to our prediction, increases in attention focusing and shifting mediated the effect of CBGT and MBSR (vs. WL). This suggests that both CBT and MBSR may increase executive ability to direct attention, albeit via different types of training methods. Enhanced attention regulation may be one shared mechanism by which both CBT and MBSR helps adults with SAD to modify overlearned

attentional biases and flexibly shift between threat and nonthreat stimuli. Although enhancement of mindfulness skills during CBT may be, at first glance, surprising, this is not a novel finding. Changes in mindfulness have been found to be a mediator of MBSR and MBCT across clinical samples (Gu et al., 2015), and specifically in patients with generalized anxiety disorder (Hoge et al., 2015).

These results highlight the many shared underlying psychological processes that are modulated during CBT and MBSR, and may help explain why both are equivalently effective for SAD. The clinical implications of this study are that both CBT and MBSR are efficacious treatments for adults with SAD. They have both shared and unique changes in underlying psychological processes that mediate or predict treatment outcome. This provides clinicians and clinics with stronger confidence in integrating MBSR into their set of interventions to treat SAD.

It is important to note that the 56.5% of the patient sample was non-White (39% Asian American, 9% Latino American, 6.5% multiple ethnicities, 1% African American, 1% Native American).

Although there was significant ethnic diversity, there was underrepresentation of African Americans in this sample. However, there was a wide range of socioeconomic status as indicated by yearly income. Thus, these results are highly generalizable.

The focus of this study was on the effects of CBGT versus MBSR (vs. WL) on traditional outcomes and treatment-related psychological processes in adults with generalized SAD. Our study could be strengthened by the inclusion of computer tasks to complement traditional outcome indices (e.g., implicit association test) and putative mechanisms (e.g., attentional control measures). In an attempt to balance the frequency and dose of treatments in our study, MBSR was modified slightly from its standard implementation. It is possible that inclusion of the 1-day silent retreat could have improved MBSR outcomes. Furthermore, community-based MBSR groups are typically larger and include individuals with a more diverse set of presenting problems. Similarly, the current results apply only to group therapy, and future research should examine whether the results replicate in the context of individual

CBT and MBSR, particularly given that mechanisms may differ between individual and group formats (Hedman et al., 2013).

Finally, experimental dismantling studies are needed to examine whether hypothesized treatment-specific mechanisms, such as cognitive reappraisal and mindfulness, differentially change (and mediate improvements) following implementation of treatmentspecific techniques (e.g., cognitive restructuring vs. mindful breath awareness). It may be that the essential ""ingredients"" in practice are an ability to (a) distance oneself from one's thoughts, whether through questioning the evidence consistent with a troubling thought or through decentering; and (b) approach previously avoided situations, whether as an attempt to gather disconfirmatory information about these situations or engage in valued action.

We examine the extent to which multiple social identities are associated with enhanced health and well-being in retirement because they provide a basis for giving and receiving social support. Results from a cross-sectional study show that retirees (N = 171) who had multiple social identities following (but not prior to) retirement report being (a) more satisfied with retirement, (b) in better health, and (c) more satisfied with life in general. Furthermore, mediation analyses revealed an indirect path from multiple social identities to greater satisfaction with retirement and better health through greater provision, but not receipt, of social support to others. These findings are the first to point to the value of multiple group membership post-retirement as a basis for increased opportunities to give meaningful support to others. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications for the management of multiple identities in the process of significant life transitions such as retirement

# INTRODUCTION

Adjustment to retirement is a major challenge. Not least, this is because for many people retirement involves giving up a work identity with which they are highly engaged, and which provides them with a sense of respect and self-worth. In this context, it is not surprising that there is a lot of variation in people's adjustment to retirement and that a substantial number of retirees report compromised health and well-being in the transition to retirement (Wang, 2007; Wang and Shi, 2014). Nevertheless, such findings beg the question of how best to manage the transition to retirement so as to allow people to maintain, and possibly enhance, their health and wellbeing. Speaking to this issue, the social identity approach suggests that individuals' social group memberships - and the sense of we' and 'us' (or social identities) that they derive from these are a basis for optimizing health and well-being (Haslam et al., 2009; Jetten et al., 2012; Tewari et al., 2012; Cruwys et al., 2014; Sani et al., 2015; Steffens et al., 2016c). Moreover, while a focus on social group memberships provides a useful theoretical framework for understanding why retirement puts people at risk (because it entails losing valued group memberships), it also points to potential ways to promote successful adjustment - namely, compensating for the loss of work group membership by strengthening memberships in other social groups post-retirement.

In the present research we draw on findings in the retirement, social identity, and social support literatures and propose that retirees' multiple identities - that is, the number of social groups that they regard as self-defining - are associated with better adjustment and greater well-being. More

specifically, we propose that having more (rather than few) social identities post-retirement can have benefits for health because these afford opportunities to make meaningful contributions to the lives of others through the provision of social support.

# Multiple Identities and Retirement Adjustment

Retirement constitutes a major life change and involves the loss of an activity that people have typically engaged in for a large part of their lives. Given the scale of the transition, it has the capacity to alter (for good or ill) how people live and feel (Pinquart and Schindler, 2007; Wang, 2007). To understand this process, scholars have focused on examining the factors that influence people's ability to adjust to retirement (Coe and Zamarro, 2011; Wang and Shi, 2014). Specifically, evidence suggests that adjustment tends to be more successful where people engage in financial decision-making (Topa et al., 2009; Adams and Rau, 2011; Feldman and Beehr, 2011) and in planning the timing of their exit from work (Litwin, 2007; Brockmann et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2016), as well as participating in post-retirement leisure activities (Dorfman and Kolarik, 2005; Nimrod, 2007) and physical exercise (Lord et al., 2003; Nimrod et al., 2008). Yet despite considerable attention to these factors in retirement planning, a substantial number of people fail to adjust successfully (Wang, 2007). So there is clearly more to the story.

In addition to these factors, we propose that our capacity to adjust to retirement is also likely to be impacted by our social connectedness to others, and particularly to groups of others. Indeed, this proposition follows from the Social Identity Model of Identity Change (SIMIC; Jetten et al., 2009) which provides a way of conceptualizing the role that group memberships, and the social identities that underpin them, play in life changes such as retirement. This suggests that belonging to, and maintaining membership in, multiple social groups helps protect people's health and well-being in the face of life transitions. In line with this general proposition, empirical evidence shows that belonging to multiple groups has health-related benefits for those experiencing a range of life-changing events such as starting life as a university student (Iyer et al., 2009), recovering from a stroke (Haslam et al., 2008), and adjusting to life following brain injury (Jones et al., 2011).

More directly relevant to our present concerns, there is evidence that membership of multiple social groups also reduces the risk of premature death in retirees. Speaking to this issue, Steffens et al. (2016a) investigated the contribution of social group ties to mortality in the 6 years following retirement in a nationally representative sample of over 400 individuals in England. One of the study's most striking findings was that retirees who maintained multiple group ties during this transition were far less likely to die prematurely. More specifically, if people had two group memberships prior to retirement, they had only a 2% risk of early death if they maintained both, but this increased markedly if they lost one or both groups (to 5% and 12%, respectively). Importantly, these results controlled for factors that might otherwise be expected to restrict a person's ability to maintain group memberships (e.g., physical health and age). Furthermore, the study also found that 6 years post-retirement life satisfaction was 10% lower for every group membership that people lost but did not replace.

 Yet while this study demonstrates the importance of multiple social groups for people in retirement, it was not able to explore the contribution of self-identified groups to the observed relationships (i.e., those which are important and central to a person's self-concept). This is relevant to the core tenet of self-categorization theory - that groups determine people's psychology to the extent that they self-categorize and see themselves as part of a given group. Accordingly, attempting to index this construct through a list of pre-determined groups identified by researchers (rather than participants) will often fail to fully capture the diverse range of possible social groups to which people feel a psychological sense of belonging (for a more detailed discussion, see Cruwys et al., 2016). In particular, this approach may (a) miss groups that people see themselves as members of, but also (b) enhance the salience of a particular group by virtue of mentioning it, or (c) change the content and number of groups with which people identify in response to being primed with a list. It follows that any estimations based on pre-selected groups will tend to provide an inaccurate measure of multiple group membership and, ultimately, an inaccurate test of theoretical assertions related to this construct. In contrast, eliciting details of groups that participants generate themselves allows for a more accurate operationalization of the theoretical construct (than pre-determined groups) and, in turn, should provide a better index with which to test relationships of theoretical interest.

Even more important is the fact that this research was not able to examine the mechanisms that might underlie the beneficial effects of multiple identities. In particular, while there is strong evidence that social support is likely to be a critical mediator of the relationship between social identification and well-being (for a review, see Haslam et al., 2012), the role that this plays in helping retirees with multiple identities adjust to, and maintain their health in, retirement remains to be tested. The present research addresses both these limitations. In so doing it also simultaneously examines the degree to which both the provision and the receipt of support are implicated in the health-protecting benefits of multiple identities.

# Multiple Identities, Provision of Social Support, and Health

Theoretical and empirical research have suggested that self-categorization (and social identification) with a social group provides access to important sources of social support (Wiesenfeld et al., 2001; Levine et al., 2002, 2005; Reicher et al., 2006; Haslam et al., 2012). Added to this, research has demonstrated that this feeling of being socially supported is a key factor that explains (i.e., mediates) the effect that identification with a group has on people's health. In this regard, there is abundant evidence of an indirect effect of social identification on health through received social support - both in groups in organizational contexts (van Dick et al., 2004; Haslam et al., 2005; Haslam and Reicher, 2006; McKimmie et al., 2009; Avanzi et al., 2015; Ketturat et al., 2016) as well as in leisure and other nonwork group contexts (Branscombe et al., 1999; Crabtree et al.,

2010). Yet, it has been suggested that if one group is beneficial for social support, then more groups are likely to further enhance the experience of social support. Indeed, the same pathway from identity to health via received social support has also been found in studies of multiple identities (Haslam et al., 2016b; Walter et al., 2016). From this plethora of studies, we can thus conclude that identification with (single and multiple) social groups is associated with better health and well-being in part because it provides people with a basis for being supported, and, more particularly, perceiving that they are supported, by others.

Yet while receiving support may be important in accounting for the link between social identity and health, another body of research indicates that it is often not the act of receiving but the act of giving support that is important in promoting health. Along these lines, evidence indicates that individuals' health and wellbeing increase when they give support to others - be it in the form of (a) money (Dunn et al., 2008, 2010; Aknin et al., 2009, 2013), (b) time (Wheeler et al., 1998; Thoits and Hewitt, 2001; Campbell et al., 2009; Sarid et al., 2010; Choi and Kim, 2011), or (c) emotional help (Brown et al., 2003; Abolfathi Momtaz et al., 2014). Indeed, Brown et al.'s (2003) seminal study which examined older married couples (all males were older than 65 years) over a period of 5 years - found that giving support to one's spouse was more important in reducing mortality than receiving support from them (see also Abolfathi Momtaz et al., 2014). This then also suggests that changes in people's lives that result in the loss of opportunities to give support (e.g., to engage in volunteering) can have negative health and well-being implications (e.g., by lowering people's life satisfaction; Meier and Stutzer, 2008). Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the healthpromoting effects of giving are particularly pronounced among older adults (Van Willigen, 2000; Musick and Wilson, 2003). For example, Greenfield and Marks (2004) found that the well-being of older adults who suffered from a loss of a role identity benefited to a great extent (and more than their younger counterparts) from volunteering their time to help others.

Drawing on the findings from these literatures, we argue that multiple identities in retirement are likely to be associated with enhanced health not only because they provide a basis for receiving support but also because they provide opportunities to give support. Indeed, of these two forms of social support, one might expect that the provision of social support will be especially protective in light of evidence that older adults derive greater health and well-being benefits from giving support than receiving it.

# The Present Research

In the present research, we investigate the link between multiple identities, retirement satisfaction, subjective quality of life, and subjective health in the transition to retirement. We hypothesize that multiple identities will be associated with retirees' (a) better adjustment to the retirement transition (H1a), (b) better subjective health (H1b), and (c) greater subjective quality of life (H1c). We also examine these associations as they relate to people's multiple identities before and after retirement in order to better understand the contribution of identities to health and well-being outcomes in the course of the transition. In

line with findings by Steffens et al. (2016a) - who found that social group memberships following, but not prior, to retirement impacted mortality - we expect that multiple identities following retirement will be more important than those prior to retirement (H2). Furthermore, we examine the contribution that the nature of social support (i.e., giving and receiving) makes to the relationship between multiple identities and these three outcomes. In light of previous research, we hypothesize that not only receiving (H3) but also giving (H4) social support will mediate the effects of multiple identities on (a) retirement satisfaction, (b) subjective health, and (c) subjective quality of life.

# MATERIALS AND METHODS

## Participants and Procedure

The study received ethics approval by the Behavioral and Social Sciences Ethical Review Committee at the first author's university (Ref: 2012001231). We recruited a sample of 171 (71 female; 98 male; 2 undisclosed) retired individuals residing in Australia. Participants were recruited via different organizations that distributed an online survey to individuals who had recently retired (i.e., individuals who had stopped work and were not undertaking bridging or part-time work). This included the Ageing Mind Initiative's [AMI] (2016) 50+ Registry, which has a database of people over 50 years who are willing to take part in research projects on ageing, and the Online Research Unit [ORU], 2016, the largest professional online research organization in Australia. Participants had an average age of 67.38 years (SD = 4.45) and they had been retired for an average of 3.63 years (SD = 3.86). Participants were invited to participate in a study titled ""Transition to Retirement Survey."" After providing their informed consent, participants responded to the survey measures as indicated below. For all scales, unless stated otherwise, participants indicated their level of agreement with each item on scales ranging from 1 (not at all) to 7 (completely). Following completion of the survey, participants were debriefed and thanked for their involvement in the study.

## Measures Multiple Identities

Participants used a multiple group membership listing task (Haslam et al., 2008) to identify the social groups that they belonged to and that they saw as important to their sense of self both pre- and post-retirement. Participants were given examples of categories and types of social groups (e.g., leisure or social groups, which could include book and gardening clubs; community groups, which could include church groups; workgroups which could include work teams), before being asked to provide up to a maximum of six social groups to which they belonged separately for the period before and after retirement. On average, participants reported being members of three groups prior to retirement (M = 2.99; SD = 1.89) and following retirement (M = 3.08; SD = 1.88). For each group that they identified, they also indicated on a scale ranging from 1 (not important) to 7 (very important) how important each group was to them.

#### Received Social Support

Participants responded to four items assessing their received social support (α = 0.92; adapted from Jetten et al., 2012; ""People that are important to me help me with my tasks""; ""People that are important to me provide me with emotional support""; ""People that are important to me listen to me if I need to talk""; ""People that are important to me make me feel loved and cared for"").

#### Provided Social Support

We adapted the same four items that were used to measure received social support to assess provided social support (α = 0.86; adapted from Jetten et al., 2012): ""I help people that are important to me with their tasks,"" ""I provide emotional support to people that are important to me,"" ""I listen to those people that are important to me if they need to talk,"" and ""I make those people that are important to me feel loved and cared for.""

#### Satisfaction with Retirement

Participants responded to three items assessing their satisfaction with retirement, adapted from Spector's (1997) Job Satisfaction Scale (α = 0.84). These items were: ""In general, I am satisfied with being retired,"" ""In general, I don't like being retired"" [reversecoded], and ""In general, I like the fact that I am retired.""

#### Subjective Health Status

Participants responded to three items assessing their subjective health status (α = 0.97; adapted from Eriksson et al., 2001). These were: ""At the moment, my health is very good,"" ""At the moment, my health is in an excellent condition,"" and ""At the moment, I feel very healthy.""

## Subjective Quality of Life

Quality of life is a multi-dimensional construct that comprises both subjective and objective elements (Fernández-Ballesteros, 2011). In line with points made in the Introduction, in the present research we focused on subjective quality of life and used Diener et al. (1985) Satisfaction with Life Scale to assess this construct (a = 0.89). Items were as follows: ""In most ways my life is close to ideal,"" ""The conditions of my life are excellent,"" ""I am satisfied with life,"" ""So far I have gotten the important things I want in life,"" and ""If I could live my life over, I would change almost nothing.""

# RESULTS

## Main Analyses

Means, standard deviations (SDs), and zero-order correlations between measures are presented in Table 1. We ran a series of hierarchical linear regressions in which we entered multiple identities pre-retirement at Step 1 and then multiple identities post-retirement at Step 2 as predictors of satisfaction with retirement, subjective health status, and subjective quality of life.

## Satisfaction with Retirement

As shown in Table 2, supporting H1a, linear regression analyses indicated a significant effect of multiple identities pre-retirement at Step 1 (ß = 0.17, p = 0.040) that accounted for 3% of the variance in satisfaction with retirement. When entering multiple identities post-retirement as an additional predictor at Step 2, multiple identities pre-retirement was no longer a significant predictor (ß = 0.03, p = 0.776) and only multiple identities post-retirement significantly predicted satisfaction in retirement (ß = 0.21, p = 0.038). This suggests that multiple identities prior to retirement is a significant predictor on its own but it ceases to be a significant predictor once one controls for the shared variance between multiple identities following retirement and retirement satisfaction (supporting H2). Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the variance accounted for by the model that included both predictors (at Step 2) increased significantly to a total of 6%.

## Subjective Health Status

Consistent with H1b, multiple identities pre-retirement was a significant predictor of subjective health status at Step 1 (ß = 0.24, p = 0.003), accounting for 6% of the variance. However, it was not a significant predictor at Step 2 when both multiple identities prior to and following retirement are entered (ß = 0.10, p = 0.338). Supporting H2, at Step 2 only multiple identities postretirement was a significant predictor (β = 0.22, p = 0.028) and this model accounted for a greater proportion (a total of 9%) of the variance in subjective health status.

## Subjective Quality of Life

Supporting H1c, analysis revealed a marginally significant effect of pre-retirement multiple identities at Step 1 (ß = 0.16, p = 0.053) that explained 2% of the total variance. At Step 2, and consistent with H2, pre-retirement multiple identities were no longer a significant predictor (ß = - 0.01, p = 0.989) but post-retirement multiple identities were (ß = 0.25, p = 0.017). Together the predictors explained an even greater share (i.e., 6%) of the total variance. In the context of the transition, these results indicate that if a retiree had three group memberships prior to retirement but then lost two group memberships (so that they now had one) their mean subjective quality of life was 5.40 (on a 7-point scale). However, a retiree's mean subjective quality of life was 6.05 if they maintained three group memberships after retirement and 6.70 if they gained two group memberships (so that they now had five). These results are presented in Figure 1.

#### Mediation via Received and Provided Social Support

We examined the extent to which the relationship between multiple identities and satisfaction with retirement was mediated by received and provided social support. For this purpose, we ran bias-corrected bootstrapping multiple mediation analyses with 5000 resamples using PROCESS (Model 4; Hayes, 2013). Multiple mediation analysis has the advantage that it can test the indirect effect through given and provided social support, while simultaneously controlling for the impact of the other variable.

Results indicated that the indirect path from multiple identities post-retirement to satisfaction with retirement through provided social support was significant, y = 0.04, SE = 0.03,

H3c in so far as the indirect path through received social support was non-significant, y = 0.01, SE = 0.02, 95%CIs [-0.03,0.07], R2 Model = 0.23, AR2 AdditionofMediators = 0.14. Consistent with H4, these mediation analyses thus indicate that the relationship between multiple identities and health and well-being outcomes was not mediated by retirees' receipt of support but was mediated by their provision of it to others

In addition, we examined whether received social support was a significant mediator when examined on its own (without controlling simultaneously for provided social support). This analysis indicated that the indirect path from multiple identities post-retirement to satisfaction with retirement through received social support was significant, y = 0.02, SE = 0.02, 95%CIs [0.00,0.07], R2 Model = 0.08, △R2 AdditionofMediator = 0.02. Furthermore, results revealed that the indirect effect of multiple identities post-retirement through received social support was

also significant in the analysis for subjective health status, y = 0.05, SE = 0.02, 95%CIs [0.01,0.10], R2 Model = 0.13, △R2 AdditionofMediator = 0.05, and subjective quality of life, y = 0.06, SE = 0.03, 95%CIs [0.02,0.13], R2 Model = 0.20, △R2 AdditionofMediator = 0.11. In sum, results indicate that, consistent with previous research, received social support is a significant mediator of the link between multiple identities and health when examined on its own. In addition, results also indicate that in the present sample the link between multiple identities and health through received social support is accounted for by the shared variance with provided social support.

## Sensitivity Analyses

We conducted four further tests to establish the robustness of the patterns observed above. First, it is possible that the effects of possessing more social identities might be linear but also that they saturate such that once a person has many rather than few groups any additional group might provide fewer health benefits. To address this question, we examined whether there was evidence of a curvilinear relationship between multiple identities and dependent variables in order to examine whether the benefits of each additional social group membership decreases as the number of social group memberships increases. This involved computing the quadratic term of multiple identities following retirement (to reduce collinearity between predictors, multiple identities were Z-standardized prior to calculating the quadratic term) and then running a series of linear regression analyses in which the (Z-standardized) linear term was added at Step 1 and the quadratic term was added as a predictor at Step 2. Analysis revealed that the quadratic term was unrelated to, and did not account for additional variance beyond that accounted for by the linear term in the prediction of, satisfaction with retirement, b = - 0.03, 95%CIs [-0.26,0.20], ß = - 0.02, ΔR2 < 0.001, p = 0.780, subjective health status, b = - 0.21, 95%CIs [-0.45,0.02], ß = - 0.13, AR2 = 0.018, p = 0.075, and subjective quality of life, b = - 0.10, 95%CIs

[-0.30,0.11], ß = - 0.72, △R2 = 0.005, p = 0.364. In sum, there was no evidence of a curvilinear relationship between multiple identities and dependent variables, suggesting that there were no diminishing marginal returns associated with multiple identities and that the relationships never become negative.

Second, to gain insight into the directionality of the relationships in our focal mediation model, we ran additional sensitivity analyses examining the reversed mediation from better health via social support to multiple identities. Results indicated that none of the reversed indirect paths from health measures (as independent variables) via received and provided social support to multiple identities post-retirement (as the dependent variable) were significant. More specifically, the (reversed) indirect paths to multiple identities post-retirement through both received and provided social support were not significant when examining (a) satisfaction with retirement as the independent variable (received support: y = 0.03, SE = 0.03, 95%CIs [-0.01,0.12]; provided support: y = 0.01, SE = 0.03, 95%CIs [-0.06,0.08], R2 Model = 0.10, △R2 AdditionofMediators = 0.03), (b) subjective health status as the independent variable (received support: y = 0.05, SE = 0.05, 95%CIs [-0.02,0.16]; provided support: y = - 0.01, SE = 0.05, 95%CIs [-0.11,0.10], R2 Model = 0.11, ΔR2 AdditionofMediators = 0.02), or (c) subjective quality of life as the independent variable (received support: y = 0.07, SE = 0.07, 95%CIs [-0.05,0.21]; provided support: y = 0.01, SE = 0.07, 95%CIs [-0.12,0.15], R2 Model = 0.10, △R2 AdditionofMediators = 0.02).

Finally, we ran additional analyses that included the number of highly important groups (rated above the mid-point of the scale - i.e., 5 or higher on the 1 to 7 scale). Results indicated that the number of highly important identities post-retirement (while controlling for those pre-retirement) were positively associated with all health outcomes (predicting a similar or a slightly greater proportion of the variance across the variables): (a) satisfaction with retirement, ß = 0.22, p = 0.022, R2 Model = 0.05, (b) subjective health status, ß = 0.34, p < 0.001, R2 Model = 0.13, and (c) subjective quality of life, ß = 0.27, p = 0.004, R2 Model = 0.08. This confirms the point that it is people's sense of psychological connectedness with groups that determines health outcomes.

## DISCUSSION

In the present research, we examined the extent to which retirees' multiple identities - both before and after the transition to retirement - are associated with their adjustment to retirement and their health. Results show that the more social group memberships retirees had following retirement, (a) the more satisfied they were with retirement, and (b) the better their subjective health and (c) the better their subjective quality of life (supporting H1). Furthermore, evidence indicated that these health benefits primarily derived from multiple identities following (but not prior to) retirement (supporting H2). The present findings demonstrate that being less well connected before retirement need not be detrimental as people can still
![](0__page_6_Figure_2.jpeg)

experience good health in retirement to the extent that they develop and build multiple social identities.

Sensitivity analyses also indicated that there was no evidence of a curvilinear relationship between multiple identities and retirement satisfaction and health, suggesting that there were no diminishing marginal returns of multiple identities and, more particularly, that the relationships never become negative. Finally, speaking to the mechanism through which multiple identities protect health and well-being in retirement, results revealed an indirect effect through giving social support but not through receiving social support (when controlling simultaneously for giving social support). Specifically, retirees who had multiple identities indicated that they provided more social support to others and this in turn was associated with greater satisfaction with retirement, better health, and greater subjective quality of life (providing support for H4).

The present findings make at least three important contributions to the literatures on retirement, multiple identities, and health. First, we are only just starting to understand how social group memberships are implicated in people's ability to adjust to a life change that most individuals experience at some point in their lifetime - namely, retirement (Steffens et al., 2016a). Yet this prior research provided limited insight into the extent to which multiple identities impact retirees' adjustment and health because the research (a) relied on groups whose specification was fixed and pre-determined, and (b) did not consider retirement satisfaction (as a direct indicator of retirees' psychological adjustment to retirement). Our results extend this research and provide more conclusive support for the idea that individuals' multiple identities - subjective group memberships that they self-identify as being part of who they are - are associated with successful retirement. Retirees who felt connected to a greater number of social groups not only had

greater subjective quality of life but also were more satisfied with retirement and experienced better health.

Second, our results shed some light on the processes through which multiple identities are associated with better health in retirement. Previous research that explored these issues has shown that social identities are health-enhancing because they provide people with a sense that they are supported by other people (Haslam et al., 2005, 2016b; Crabtree et al., 2010; Avanzi et al., 2015; Walter et al., 2016). However, the present study extends our understanding of the various ways in which multiple identities are associated with health. Specifically, by examining the provision and receipt of social support simultaneously, our findings indicate that retirees' multiple identities indirectly impacted their satisfaction with retirement and health primarily because these are a basis for providing social support. This is not to say that receiving social support is unimportant for health and well-being. Indeed, if one does not control for provided social support, received social support is a significant mediator. Nevertheless, in line with previous research (Brown et al., 2003; Abolfathi Momtaz et al., 2014), it appears that, when examined simultaneously, the provision of social support explains more variance in health than its receipt, and that provision of social support is a particularly powerful mechanism in the multiple identitieshealth link. More generally, then, this suggests that in lifechanging contexts such as retirement, where individuals are stripped of one important way to contribute to society, multiple identities provide a vehicle for continuing to make a significant contribution to the lives of others and thereby to sustain a healthy life.

Third, the present results suggest that the process of retirement might be enhanced through facilitation of retirees' social group-based connections to others. Thus, in addition to making financial, residential, medical care, and physical activity plans, our findings suggest that it is also important for retirees to plan how they might stay (or become) socially connected to groups that can provide them with a sense of communality and belonging. Moreover, the fact that beneficial effects were strongest for retirees who had a greater number of social identities post-retirement suggests that these plans need not be constrained by a person's social circumstances prior to retirement. For, as the present data show, building one's network of social group memberships after retirement can bring health and well-being gain. While this network may be more difficult to develop and embed for those less well connected before they retire, there is evidence that they can be strengthened by social interventions that explicitly target social disconnection (e.g., GROUPS 4 HEALTH; Haslam et al., 2016a). There is clearly mileage in future research seeking to establish whether such an intervention - whose goal is explicitly to build and maintain multiple social identities - can be successfully adapted to promote the health and well-being of retirees.

### Limitations and Future Research

The present research is not without limitations. Primary amongst these is the fact that, because the study has a cross-sectional design it cannot establish causality in the associations investigated here. Future research should therefore employ longitudinal and experimental (intervention) studies in order to shed light on directionality (as do Steffens et al., 2016a). In this regard it is worth noting, though, that we do not rule out the possibility that health may also increase people's willingness to provide social support - even though in the present study there was no evidence of this reversed mediation. Indeed, research on the link between giving and happiness shows that this link is likely to be mutually reinforcing (bidirectional) such that giving increases happiness, which in turn, increases giving (Thoits and Hewitt, 2001; Aknin et al., 2012). Nevertheless, it would clearly be useful for long-term panel studies to shed light on this issue by exploring the strength of these different pathways. In this regard too, we cannot exclude the possibility that part of the variance may be explained by individual differences (tor example, people who are cognitively more flexible or more open to experience may be more likely to join new groups in retirement). Having said this, research from other fields shows that effects of multiple group memberships are not reducible to stable individual differences. In this regard, an experimental study by Jones and Jetten (2011) showed that reflecting on many, rather than few, group memberships led to subsequent increases in resilience, while an intervention study by Haslam et al. (2016a) that focused on the maintenance and development of social group memberships produced improvement in participants' health. Furthermore, Steffens et al. (2016b) controlled for the Big Five in their studies that examined the link between multiple social identities and creativity and found that results could not be reduced to differences in personality. Nevertheless, it is possible that retirees' willingness and capacity to develop new multiple identities may in part be impacted by other variables, a possibility that future research should examine.

Moreover, it is certainly the case that one's social life involves not only group-based social ties but also those with significant individuals, which have been shown to be important in adjusting to retirement. In this context, spousal relationships have been highlighted as particularly important (Kupperbusch et al., 2003; Davey and Szinovacz, 2004; Bushfield et al., 2008), but as these were not the focus of the present research, we cannot comment on the contribution that (particular) individual relationships make relative to group-based relationships. Interestingly, though, relationships that people have with significant others tend not to be confined to one-on-one interaction, but often occur in the context of wider group-based interaction (with the family in the case of a spouse, or a work team in the case of a professional colleague). While we are not discounting the important role that one-on-one relationships have for health and well-being, there is a growing body of evidence from a variety of (healthy, vulnerable, and clinical) populations which indicates that social connectedness to groups is a unique and reliable predictor of several health outcomes (for reviews, see Cruwys et al., 2014; Jetten et al., 2014; Steffens et al., 2016c). Along these lines, Sani et al. (2012) have shown that health effects derive from feeling oneself to be

part of a social group and not merely from one's amount of social contact. Furthermore, Haslam et al. (2014) have shown that it is group ties and not one-on-one ties that predict subsequent cognitive health among older adults, and Glei et al. (2005) have found that group-based activities are more important than individual engagement with significant others (with a spouse, close relative, friend) in protecting cognitive health over time. Having said this, further research is needed to disentangle and quantify the extent to which retirees' health benefits derive from different aspects of their social group memberships as well as other aspects of their social life. For instance, future research should examine the extent to which adjustment to retirement is impacted by the perceived compatibility between the multiple groups that retirees are part of (Iyer et al., 2009) as well as the sense of continuity in their group memberships and associated sense of self (Sani, 2008; Sani et al., 2008).

Furthermore, there would also be value in future work that expands the scope of the potential outcomes that flow from having multiple identities. For example, it would be interesting to investigate not only retirees' sustained mental and physical health but also other aspects of an engaged healthy life such as cognitive function (e.g., memory and creativity; Haslam et al., 2014; Steffens et al., 2016b) and resilience (e.g., the capacity to bounce back from significant set-backs; Jones et al., 2011; Cruwys et al., 2013). Similarly, it would be worthwhile disentangling the active ingredients in the provision of social support that are associated with better health and well-being. In this regard, it is noteworthy that the association between social support and the various health outcomes was overall of moderate magnitude, while the association between multiple identities and both forms of social support was only in the weak to moderate range (rs = 0.16 and 0.23). To provide a better understanding of these relationships, future research might shed light on the extent to which (a) multiple identities are related to different aspects of provision of support, such as one's motivation, actual supportive behaviors, or the impact that giving has on others (Bolino and Grant, 2016) and (b) these different elements have benefits for people's health and wellbeing.

Finally, in the present research we focused on subjectively experienced (and reported) support and health (rather than objective indicators of support and health) and future research might extend the present examination by including other more objective indicators of these measures (see also Fernandez-Ballesteros, 2011). It is important to note though, that people are generally capable of reporting meaningfully the way they experience their health and reviews indicate that reported quality of life and subjective health status are powerful predictors of a range of other third-party rated and objective health measures (including mortality; Pavot et al., 1991; Idler and Benyamini,

1997). Accordingly, while previous research might lead one to expect weaker effects for objective physical than subjective psychological health measures (e.g., see Steffens et al., 2016c), there are no grounds for expecting the pattern of findings to be substantively different from that observed in the present research.

## CONCLUSION

The present research investigated how multiple identities in the transition to retirement are associated with successful adjustment, as well as health and well-being. Our results show that multiple identities following retirement are associated not only with greater satisfaction with retirement but also with better subjective health and enhanced subjective quality of life. Furthermore, the study is the first to demonstrate that the health-protective benefits of having multiple identities arise in part from the fact that they give people more opportunity to contribute to the lives of others through the provision of social support. This observation is important for theoretical reasons but also has the potential to inform practical interventions - in pointing to the importance of cultivating multiple social identities among retirees with a view to fostering their resilience.

Together, these various findings provide a new dimension to our understanding of the importance of networks of social group memberships in retirement. In particular, they suggest that, in the process of giving up membership in work-related group(s), access to multiple social identities allows people to continue to be active members of other valued communities and thereby to continue to have meaningful and healthy lives. Indeed, in ways that would surely please John F. Kennedy, we can see that, in retirement, multiple group memberships provide a basis for people to reap the benefits not of what others can do for them but of what they can do for others.
