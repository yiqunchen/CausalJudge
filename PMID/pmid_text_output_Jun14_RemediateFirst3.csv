Background: This paper investigates the differential ability of three components of low mindfulness to uniquely predict symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and depression, while controlling for psychological inflexibility, a construct conceptually related to low mindfulness. Also examined was the meditational role of several mindfulness facets in the relationship between psychological inflexibility and symptoms of each disorder. Methods: Using a clinical sample (n=153) containing mostly patients with GAD or depression, we conducted hierarchical multiple regression analyses and mediation analyses to determine

unique relationships.

Results: Whereas deficits in adopting a non-reactive exhibited incremental validity beyond psychological inflexibility in predicting symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder, deficits in acting with awareness did so in predicting symptoms of depression. Results of mediation analyses corroborated this pattern, as the relationships psychological inflexibility exhibited with symptoms of GAD and of depression were mediated by non-reactivity and acting with awareness, respectively.

Limitations: The cross-sectional design of this study precludes causal interpretations of the mediation models.

Conclusion: Findings corroborate the following conclusions: i) the lack of present oriented awareness experienced by individuals with symptoms of depression is not completely accounted for by psychological inflexibility nor by symptoms of GAD; ii) the reactive approach to automatic thoughts adopted by those with symptoms of GAD is not completely accounted for by psychological inflexibility nor by symptoms of depression. These conclusions suggest that it would be profitable for mindfulness-based therapies to concentrate on these specific mindfulness deficits to ameliorate the severity of GAD and depression.

Teasing apart low mindfulness: Differentiating deficits in mindfulness and in psychological flexibility in predicting symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder and depression.

Mindfulness conceptualizations of psychopathology posit that many symptoms of mood and anxiety disorders result from reactive, judgmental, and inflexible responses to negative cognitions and emotions. Often couched in terms of an inability to attain a decentered perspective, which represents one's ability to foster enough psychological distance to regard thoughts as ephemeral mental phenomena rather than accurate reflections of the self, low mindfulness entails identification with and immersion in affective reactions, conferring vulnerability to symptoms of depression and anxiety (Fresco, Flynn, Mennin, & Haigh, 2011). Teasdale's (1999) influential multilevel theory of mind identifies such maladaptive processes as the mindless emoting mode of mind, characterized by sensory driven reactions without full awareness of conceptual meanings. In the mindfulness-based stress reduction tradition, low mindfulness has been theorized to be a consequence of several universal vulnerabilities: ""those mental or behavioral habits that undermine well-being and maintain chronic feelings of dissatisfaction because of certain universal aspects of being human: having language, taking such language literally, using thought-based processes to elaborate, solve or escape from problems, and persisting in using such strategies even if these do not solve the problem"" (Williams, 2008). Not surprisingly, a swath of literature has ascertained connections between low mindfulness and symptom severity of mood and anxiety disorders (Fennell, 2004, Way, Creswell, Eisenberger, & Lieberman, 2010; Roemer et al., 2009; Arch & Craske, 2010). Indeed, several outcome studies attest the efficacy of mindfulness-based interventions, thereby suggesting that low mindfulness may partially account for symptomatology and that targeting mechanisms of mindfulness may be responsible for melioration (e.g. mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), for depression, Teasdale et al., 2000; mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), for various physical and mental pathologies, Grossman, Schmidt, & Wallace, 2004; meta-cognitive therapy (MCT), for generalized anxiety disorder, Wells et al., 2010).

Though some contend that mindfulness consists of a single factor (Brown & Ryan, 2004), many construe mindfulness as a multidimensional construct, comprising several components with a general consensus emphasizing the following: intention (or 'on purpose'), attention, and attitude (or 'with mindfulness qualities') (Shapiro, Carlson, Astin, & Freedman, 2006). The multifaceted conceptualization by Baer, Smith, Hopkins, Krietmeyer, and Toney (2006) has solicited a great deal of research and attention (c.f. Baer et al., 2008; and, Bohlmeijer, Klooster, Fledderus, Veehof, & Baer, 2011; de Bruin, Topper, Muskens, Bogels, & Kamphuis, 2012). In their model, they delineated five disparate factors that best embody overall mindfulness: 1) observe, i.e. attending to or noticing internal or external experiences; 2) describe, i.e. being able to express one's thoughts, feelings, beliefs, and other internal experiences in words; 3) act with awareness, i.e. attending to and being intimately aware of one's present activity with great focus and without being distracted; 4) non-judge, i.e. considering one's thoughts in a non-evaluative, accepting manner; 5) non-react, i.e. permitting thoughts, of varied emotional valence and intensity, to go through one's mind without getting caught up or reacting to them. Regression analyses conducted by Baer et al. (2006) in a non-clinical sample afforded evidence that three facets (i.e. act with awareness, non-judge, and non-react) significantly predict severity of psychopathological symptomatology. Nonetheless, further consideration of what factors of mindfulness evidence differential relationships with mood and anxiety disorders would be profitable.

#### Running head: TEASING APART LOW MINDFULNESS IN GAD AND DEPRESSION

Unfortunately, the appraisal of unique contributions of low mindfulness in predicting psychopathology must proceed with circumspection. Very little research has been undertaken to discern the incremental validity of mindfulness specific features while controlling for conceptually similar constructs in predicting the severity of different disorders (e.g. Lau et al., 2006). This limitation qualifies extant literature's ability to elucidate the differential roles of low mindfulness across anxiety and depressive disorders. The model of mindfulness postulated by Baer et al. (2006) bears a strong resemblance to another psychological construct, psychological inflexibility. In fact, Bond et al. (2011) acknowledged that elements of psychological inflexibility appear in MBCT, and Fergus, Valentiner, McGrath, Gier-Lonsway, and Jencius (2013) likewise acknowledged their presence in MCT. Hayes et al. (2011) posit psychological inflexibility, referring to inflexible attempts to control or alter unwanted internal events, as the chief psychopathological construct addressed by acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). Elements of both low mindfulness and psychological flexibility concern rigid responses to unwanted mental phenomena. Given the fruitful consequences of other tests of incremental validity in distinguishing conceptually related constructs (e.g., meta-cognitive therapy and psychological inflexibility, Fergus et al., 2013), submitting these two constructs of interest to such an analysis proves apposite. Hierarchical regression analyses indicating that certain facets of mindfulness evidence incremental validity beyond psychological inflexibility and other covariates in predicting symptoms of depression and generalized anxiety would illuminate the unique contribution of distinct deficits in mindfulness across separate disorders.

In consequence of a treatment emphasis on maladaptive responses to perseverative cognitions in mindfulness-based interventions, investigating the unique predictive ability of individual mindfulness facets in the context of depression and generalized anxiety disorder would be apposite (c.f. Wells (2009); Teasdale et al. 2000). Moreover, delineating the differential role of mindfulness facets can address longstanding debates about diagnostic overlap between these disorders. Prior literature has critiqued the rationale for demarcating depression and generalized anxiety disorder. Researchers sympathetic to such arguments often adduce evidence about shared genetic factors (Kendler et al., 1992; Kendler, 1996) and strong similarities in symptomatology (Slade & Watson, 2006) to corroborate proposals of subsuming both disorders under a single nosological category of distress disorders. If distinct mindfulness deficits are uniquely implicated in each disorder, then such provides a basis for mitigating diagnostic difficulties and aggrandizing the conceptual models underlying these disorders. Moreover, if unique mindfulness deficits differentially mediate the relationship between psychological inflexibility and symptoms of each disorder, then such deficits might be possible candidates for treatment mechanisms.

The purpose of the current study is threefold. First, we investigated the relationships mindfulness and psychological inflexibility exhibit with symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder and depression in a clinical sample. In addition to zero-order correlations, partial correlations were examined to determine unique relationships while controlling for other symptoms. Second, we conducted hierarchical regression analyses to determine the unique contribution of three theoretically relevant facets of mindfulness in predicting symptoms of each disorder, while controlling for psychological inflexibility, symptomatology of the other disorder, and other facets of mindfulness. Finally, we conducted meditational analyses to determine whether certain facets of mindfulness mediate the relationship between psychological flexibility and symptomatology of depression and GAD. Akin to Baer et al. (2006), we hypothesized that the following three facets were significantly predictive of psychopathology: act with awareness,

non-judge, and non-react. In a partial clinical sample, Bohlmeijer et al. (2011) obtained evidence that the mindfulness facets exhibiting the strongest inverse correlations with depression include act with awareness (r = - 20, p<. 01) and non-judge (r=- 25, p<. 01), and that those exhibiting the strongest inverse correlations with anxiety include act with awareness (r = -. 22, p<. 01), nonjudge ( =- . 24, p<. 01), and non-react ( =- . 20, p<. 01). As such, it is predicted that deficits in the act with awareness and non-judge facets will achieve incremental validity beyond psychological inflexibility and the other covariates in predicting symptoms of depression, whereas deficits in all three facets will achieve such in predicting symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder. Methodology

# Participants

Participants were 153 individuals, ages 18-71(M=38, SD=14.8) who were seeking treatment at an anxiety and mood clinic in the northeastern United States. Participants received diagnoses of unipolar mood and/or anxiety disorders. Exclusion criteria included clinically significant signs of psychosis or any organic mental disorders. Two participants met exclusion criteria, one for psychotic symptoms and one for having a non-clinically significant diagnosis, which left a total of 151 individuals. Participants identified as White (79.5%), African-American (6.6%), Hispanic (10.6%), and ""other"" (2.7%), and 63.6% of the sample was female. An institutional review board approved the study and informed consent was obtained from participants before inclusion into the study.

#### Procedures

After consent was obtained, self-report questionnaires, including those emphasized in the current study, were completed prior to commencing individual psychotherapy treatment. Following completion of the questionnaire battery, individuals were administered the clinician version of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I and II disorders (SCID-I and SCID-II). The most prevalent primary Axis I diagnoses among participants were generalized anxiety disorder (42.4%), major depressive disorder (24.5%), and social phobia (11.3%). A large percentage of the sample (77.5%) also met criteria for a secondary Axis I diagnosis, the most prevalent of which were major depressive disorder (26.5%) and generalized anxiety disorder (15.2%).

#### Measures

Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire. The FFMQ (Baer et al., 2006) is a 39-item questionnaire created to further explore the facet structure of mindfulness in daily life as a construct. Researchers combined items from five existing mindfulness questionnaires into a single data set, and performed an exploratory factor analysis. From this analysis, researchers found five component skills that contribute to mindfulness, non-reactivity to inner experiences (7 items), observing (8 items), acting with awareness (8 items), nonjudging of inner experiences (8 items), and describing (8 items; Baer et al., 2006). Items are rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale, ranging from 1 (never or very rarely true) to 5 (very often or always true). The five facet scales showed adequate-to-good internal consistency in non-meditators, with alpha coefficients ranging from .75 to .91 (Baer et. al 2006). The five factor model proved to be a good fit with experienced meditators (Baer et al., 2008).

Acceptance and Action Questionnaire, Version II. The Acceptance and Action Questionnaire I (Hayes et al., 2004) is a 9-item measure of experiential avoidance. Hayes and colleagues (2004) found that scores on the AAQ indicating higher psychological inflexibility were associated with higher levels of general psychopathology. Participants are given statements (e.g. ""I'm not afraid of my feelings"") and asked to indicate how truly each item applies to them

using a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (never true) to 7 (always true). The AAQ-II (Bond et al, 2011) is a 10 item measure which looks to improve upon the original AAQ's internal consistency, while shifting to assess psychological flexibility in accordance with the development of the ACT model. The reliability of the AAQ-II is consistently above the AAQ-I, with a mean alpha coefficient across the six samples of .84 (.78-.88), and the 3- and 12-month test-retest reliability is .81 and .79, respectively (Bond et al. 2011). In this study, relevant questions were reverse scored such that higher scores indicate greater psychological inflexibility.

Penn State Worry Questionnaire. The PSWQ (Meyer, Miller, Metzger, and Borkovec, 1990) is a 16-item inventory used to measure the generality, excessiveness, and uncontrollability of pathological worry. The PSWQ assesses an individual's tendency to worry in general, as opposed to in relation to specific worry topics. Eleven statements convey the presence of pathological worry (e.g. ""My worry overwhelms me."") and the remaining 5 items refer to the absence of this construct (e.g. ""I do not tend to worry about things.""). Participants are asked to rate how ""typical or characteristic"" each statement is of themselves on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (not at all typical) to 5 (very typical). The PSWQ has demonstrated strong internal consistency (α=95) and good test-retest reliability (Meyer et al., 1990).

Beck Depression Inventory II The BDI-II (Beck, Steer, & Brown, 1996) is a 21-item instrument designed to measure both the presence and severity of depressive symptoms. The BDI-II was developed on the basis of a two-factor model of depression and as such consists of two subscales: cognitive and somatic. Each item consists of a group of four statements that range in intensity (e.g. from ""I do not feel sad"" to ""I am so sad or unhappy that I can't stand it'""). The BDI-II is scored by assigning a value from 0-3 to each answer and summing these values to derive a total score (0-63). The BDI-II has been shown to have excellent internal consistency (a=. 90) and good psychometric properties (Storch, Roberti, & Roth, 2004).

#### Data Analytic Strategy

In addition to computing zero-order correlations for all measures, we utilized the tstatistic by Chen and Popovich (2002), developed to determine to whether a difference between two correlation coefficients from the same sample is significant, to facilitate comparisons. Partial correlations were employed to determine the relationship between each facet of mindfulness and each symptom, while controlling for the other symptom. Finally, several hierarchical multiple regression models were examined. For all models, the first step consisted of psychological inflexibility (i.e. AAQ-II) as a predictor variable and one of the symptom measures (i.e. PSWQ or BDI-II) as an outcome variable. The second and third steps included symptom measures of the other disorder and other mindfulness facets, respectively. The fourth step included the mindfulness facet of interest. Additional hierarchical models were examined to determine whether an aggregate score of all five facets, which represents mindfulness as a unidimensional construct, predicts symptomatology of each disorder, while controlling for psychological inflexibility and the other symptom type. Regression analyses were repeated for all predictors and outcome variables, yielding eight different models to be appraised.

Mediation analyses were conducted utilizing the regression-based statistical model proposed by Hayes (2013). This model posits nonparametric bootstrapping as an alternative procedure to the standard Sobel Test in calculating the indirect effect of some independent variable through a mediator on a dependent variable. Bootstrapping does not impose any assumptions about the shape of the sampling distribution of the indirect effect and, therefore, yields more accurate inferences. To establish statistical mediation, the dependent variable is regressed on the independent variable and on the mediator; the mediator is also regressed on the

#### Running head: TEASING APART LOW MINDFULNESS IN GAD AND DEPRESSION

independent variable. The effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable indexes the direct effect, whereas the effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable through the mediator indexes the indirect effect. A significant indirect effect (a.b) indicates partial mediation, and a non-significant direct effect (c') of the independent variable on the dependent variable indicates full mediation. Bootstrapping entails random resampled data with replacement from the original sample some given number of times; for this sample, data was resampled 10,000 times. In accordance with Hayes' model, interpretation of significant indirect effects involved the evaluation of 95% confidence intervals (Cls) for unstandardized regression coefficients not containing zero within range estimates and an alpha level of .05 (c.f. Preacher & Hayes, 2004, 2008; Hayes 2013).

#### Results

Correlations and descriptive statistics are displayed in Table 1. All facets of the FFMQ, except the observe facet, exhibited significant negative correlations with both generalized anxiety disorder and depression, according with prior results suggesting an inverse association between high mindfulness and psychopathology. Comparison of several coefficients, by way of the Chen and Popovich (2002) t-statistic, produced the following results: i) the negative correlation coefficient of the act with awareness facet and depression is significantly stronger than that of the act with awareness facet and generalized anxiety disorder (t= - 2.45, p<.01), ii) the negative correlation coefficient of the non-judge facet and depression is not significantly different than that of the non-judge facet and generalized anxiety disorder (t= - 952, n.s.), iii) the negative correlation coefficient of the non-react facet and depression is not significantly different than that of the non-react facet and generalized anxiety disorder (t = - 08, n.s.), and iv) the positive correlation coefficient of psychological inflexibility and depression is significantly stronger than that of psychological inflexibility and generalized anxiety disorder (t= 4.55, p<.001).

Table 2 displays significant regression results demonstrating unique relationships between the three mindfulness facets of interest and each symptom, while controlling for psychological inflexibility, symptomatology of the other disorder, and other facets of mindfulness. In predicting symptoms of depression, the act with awareness facet exhibited incremental validity while controlling for relevant covariates. In predicting symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder, the non-react facet exhibited incremental validity while controlling for relevant covariates. An aggregated total score of the FFMQ, as an index of mindfulness as a whole, did not achieve significant incremental validity in predicting symptoms of either disorder.

Mediation results are depicted in Table 3 and Figure 1. Only acting with awareness significantly mediated the relationship between psychological inflexibility and symptoms of depression. Moreover, only non-reaction significantly mediated the relationship between psychological inflexibility and symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder.

#### Discussion

The current results comport well with several predictions of low mindfulness conceptualizations of psychopathology. Measures of depression and generalized anxiety disorder exhibited inverse, significant correlations with several facets of the FFMQ, corroborating claims that high mindfulness involves fewer symptoms of mood and anxiety disorders (Baer et al., 2006). Moreover, partial correlations confirmed that all mindfulness facets except the observe facet demonstrated unique relationships with symptoms of anxiety or depression, while

controlling for effects of other symptom measures. Of the five mindfulness facets, four evinced a unique relationship with only depression, whereas two evinced a unique relationship with only generalized anxiety disorder. In light of a need to appraise the incremental validity of low mindfulness conceptualizations of psychopathology, this study represents the first endeavor to determine the unique predictive ability distinct components of mindfulness contribute to psychopathology beyond that of a closely related construct, in this case, psychological inflexibility (Hayes et al., 2011). After controlling for psychological inflexibility and other covariates, multiple hierarchical regression results substantiate that deficits in acting with awareness contributed significant, unique explanatory power in predicting symptoms of depression, and that deficits in fostering a non-reactive contributed significant, unique explanatory power in predicting symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder. Moreover, results of the mediation analyses corroborated the differential relationships between these facets of mindfulness and disorder symptomatology. Whereas only non-reaction sigmificantly mediated the relationship between psychological inflexibility and symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder, only acting with awareness significantly mediated the relationship between psychological inflexibility and symptoms of depression.

Our hypotheses were partially confirmed, as the data indicate a more circumscribed set of mindfulness deficits uniquely relevant to each disorder than was initially predicted. After controlling for symptoms of worry, all facets except observe exhibited moderate, negative partial-correlations with depression. Only acting with awareness, however, demonstrated incremental validity in predicting depression beyond psychological inflexibility, symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder, and other facets of mindfulness. Mediation results confirmed this, as acting with awareness accounts for a substantial portion of the variance in the association between psychological inflexibility and symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder. Indeed, the negative correlation coefficient between acting with awareness and depression was significantly stronger than that between acting with awareness and generalized anxiety disorder. This accords well with research investigating the phenomenology of depressed patients. The ruminative response styles adopted by depressed individuals often occasion a lack of engagement with the present world in consequence of a sustained self-reflection on the possible causes and meaning of distressful events (c.f. Nolen-Hoeksema, Wisco, & Lyubomirsky, 2008). As non-judgment failed to achieve incremental validity over psychological inflexibility, perhaps the overly judgmental perspective assumed by depressed individuals amounts to little more than a difficulty in embracing a flexible manner of responding to distressors. Alternatively, overlapping content between the two measures may assess a similar construct about judgmental attitudes relevant to depression and, therefore, may pose difficulties in attempts to establish incremental validity. For instance, the AAQ-II contains the following items, which may be construed as assessing judgmental attitudes toward depressive distressors: ""It's okay if I remember something unpleasant."", ""My painful experiences and memories make it difficult for me to live a life that I would value."", ""My painful memories prevent me from having a fulfilling life."", etc. That notwithstanding, the current results suggest that in treating depression mindfulness interventions would be most profitable by addressing an inability to engage in the present surroundings and to escape an illusory mental world fraught with perseverative thoughts about upsetting events.

As regards generalized anxiety disorder, significant negative partial-correlations were exhibited with both non-judgment and non-reaction while controlling for symptoms of depression. Results of the hierarchical regression and mediation analyses revealed that only nonreaction exhibited a unique relationship with symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder. Such

#### Running head: TEASING APART LOW MINDFULNESS IN GAD AND DEPRESSION

results might suggest that the relationship between symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder and acting with awareness obtains only in virtue of the presence of depressive symptoms. Given the robust relationship between depression and acting with awareness in this study, this explanation may be tenable. The lack of evidence for the uniqueness of non-judgement to symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder could very well be explicable by the same reasons offered for the similar pattern between non-judgement and symptoms of depression. As only non-reaction exhibited incremental validity beyond psychological inflexibility, symptoms of depression, and other facets of mindfulness, converging evidence confirms the uniqueness of this mindfulness deficit in generalized anxiety disorder. Moreover, research examining the role of metacognition in generalized anxiety disorder offers conclusions consistent with our results. Wells' model (2009) distinguishes several components of metacognition responsible for this disorder's symptomatology that evince conceptual overlap with non-reaction, including negative beliefs about the uncontrollability of worrying (e.g. ""when I start worrying, I cannot stop"") and about themes of danger and responsibility in the context of worrying (e.g. ""worrying is dangerous"" and ""not being able to control my thought is a sign of weakness"") (c.f. Wells, 1999). The similitude between these specific metacognitive and mindfulness deficits offers a felicitous explanation as to why Fergus et al. (2013) ascertained evidence substantiating the incremental validity of low metacognition beyond psychological inflexibility in predicting generalized anxiety disorder. These conclusions provide impetus for mindfulness interventions to concentrate on reactive responses to worrying to ameliorate the severity of generalized anxiety disorder.

That psychological inflexibility exhibited significant, moderate correlations with most facets of the FFMQ, with significant coefficients ranging between - 38 and - 54, indicates convergent validity between these two constructs. Thus, low mindfulness and psychological inflexibility appear to be related constructs without substantial redundancy. The unique relationships between several facets of mindfulness and symptoms of each disorder as evidenced by the results of partial-correlations, hierarchical regression, and mediation analyses testify to this. Several tenable explanations, however, can account for the unique predictive ability of mindfulness over psychological inflexibility.

It could be contended that our results are the consequence of the different factor structures inherent in these measures. The measure assessing mindfulness exhibits a multidimensional structure (Baer et al., 2006), in accord with abundant research examining mindfulness as a variable that consists of several latent factors (Bohlmeijer et al., 2011; de Bruin et al., 2012; Baer, Smith, & Allen, 2004; and Dimidjian & Linehan, 2003). Bond et al. (2011), however, construe psychological inflexibility as a foundational, single-factor construct broad enough to accommodate psychopathological processes across many disorders. It could be that certain facets of the FFMQ evidence incremental validity only in virtue of the fact that the measure represents mindfulness as multi-factorial. The fact that the FFMQ consists of several disparate, but related, factors might inflate the likelihood of achieving discrimination from psychological inflexibility. Perhaps only individual facets of mindfulness prove significantly distinct from psychological inflexibility and achieve unique predictive ability, yet measures of overall mindfulness, as a unified, monolithic construct, may not accomplish incremental validity in predicting symptomatology. If either mindfulness were represented as one factor or psychological inflexibility as several factors, then the unique predictive power of either construct might be attenuated after entering both into a regression model. Such was confirmed by our hierarchical regression results using an aggregate total score of the FFMQ.

This psychometric concern may very plausibly be corollary to underlying conceptual considerations. An alternative explanation involves not the disparities in factor structure between the measures, but rather a conceptual distinction between low mindfulness and psychological inflexibility. The latter has been delineated as a broad, embracive construct that accounts for symptomatology across several disorders. Subsumable under psychological inflexibility are several inter-related cognitive processes, e.g. rumination and worry, pertaining to inflexible responses to untoward mental phenomena (c.f. Kashdan & Rottenberg, 2010; Bond et al., 2011; Fergus et al., 2013). Particular deficits in mindfulness have been implicated in specific emotion dysregulation strategies (e.g. acting with awareness was negatively incrementally related to difficulties engaging in goal-directed behavior; Vujavonic, Bonn-Miller, Bernstein, Mckee, & Zvolensky, 2010), obsessive-compulsive disorder (e.g. patients with this disorder exhibited deficits in acting with awareness, nonjudging of inner experience, and nonreactivity to inner experience; Didonna, 2009), generalized anxiety disorder (e.g. automatic, perseverative cognitive reactivity manifests as worrying; Behar & Borkovec, 2005), depression (e.g. deficits in acting with awareness was associated with exacerbated depressive symptoms; Cash & Whittingham, 2010), etc. Thus, evidence preponderates in favor of multi-factorial conceptualization of mindfulness such that particular mindfulness deficits differentially correspond to particular disorders or symptom clusters. In light of conceptual considerations, perhaps particular deficits in mindfulness distinguish the symptomatology of certain disorders beyond a general foundation of pervasive inflexibility. The psychometric argument and the conceptual argument need not be incompatible. In fact, both positions appear to comport well with one another, as the factor structure of each measure is informed by theoretical considerations of each construct.

The current study represents an initial effort in elucidating the connections between unique deficits in mindfulness and symptoms of depression and generalized anxiety disorder, after controlling for conceptually relevant covariates. Further research efforts must be undertaken to confer greater certainty about the differential role of specific mechanisms of mindfulness across mood and anxiety disorders. Several concerns remain unresolved or prove difficult to reconcile with our results. For instance, deficits in acting with awareness have been identified as a characteristic consequence of worrying in generalized anxiety disorder, notwithstanding the present results suggesting otherwise (c.f. Behar & Borkovec, 2005). Other limitations also warrant acknowledgement. First, certain methodological considerations may attenuate confidence in our results, e.g. self-report, fixed order. The cross-sectional design of this study precluded causal interpretations of the mediation results. Second, for those variables achieving incremental validity, the change in variance, though significant, was small, perhaps indicating that these specific components of mindfulness fail to differentiate robustly from psychological inflexibility. Nonetheless, the conclusions derived from our study afford reason to believe that symptoms of depression and generalized anxiety disorder may be partially distinguishable on the basis of their unique relationships with distinct mindfulness deficits. Moreover, two separate, but converging, bodies of evidence legitimize the specificity of these deficits: i) unique relationships were obtained while controlling for the confounding influences of psychological inflexibility and other conceptually relevant covariates, and ii) the same relationships were confirmed by mediation analyses. Further understanding of the causal relationships between discrete mechanisms of mindfulness and symptom severity of mood and anxiety disorders can intelligently inform therapeutic interventions in the treatment of these disorders.

A recent wave of research suggests that teachers overrate the performance of girls relative to boys and hold more positive attitudes toward girls' mathematics abilities. However, these prior estimates of teachers' supposed female bias are potentially misleading because these estimates (and teachers themselves) confound achievement with teachers' perceptions of behavior and effort. Using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-1999 (ECLS-K), Study 1 demonstrates that teachers actually rate boys' mathematics proficiency higher than that of girls when conditioning on both teachers' ratings of behavior and approaches to learning as well as past and current test scores. In other words, on average girls are only perceived to be as mathematically competent as similarly achieving boys when the girls are also seen as working harder, behaving better, and being more eager to learn. Study 2 uses mediation analysis with an instrumental-variables approach, as well as a matching strategy, to explore the extent to which this conditional underrating of girls may explain the widening gender gap in mathematics in early elementary school. We find robust evidence suggesting that underrating girls' mathematics proficiency accounts for a substantial portion of the development of the mathematics achievement gap between similarly performing and behaving boys and girls in the early grades.

Gender gaps in mathematics achievement emerge early. Perhaps the strongest evidence for the development of such gaps is found in nationally representative data collected by the U.S. Department of Education (D.O.E.). In particular, studies using the Early Child-

hood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-1999 (ECLS-K) indicate that although the average achievement of boys and girls is similar in kindergarten, a male advantage of about one quarter of a standard deviation emerges by the spring of third grade (Fryer & Levitt, 2010; Husain & Millimet, 2009; Penner & Paret, 2008; Robinson & Lubienski, 2011). Past research has shown that gender gaps in mathematics are at least in part socially constructed and that parents and teachers are socializing agents in the construction of gender (Beilock, Gunderson, Ramirez, & Levine, 2010; Eccles, 1986; Else-Quest, Hyde, & Linn, 2010; Gunderson, Ramirez, Levine, & Beilock, 2012). In the current study, we examine the role that teachers' perceptions may play in the development of gaps in boys' and girls' mathematics proficiency.

Using the ECLS-K data set, we find that elementary school teachers tend to rate the mathematics skills of boys higher than those of girls who perform and behave similarly. This finding might appear to conflict with recent studies that suggest that teachers rate the mathematics abilities and performance of girls at least as favorably as they do those of boys (Fryer & Levitt, 2010; Lavy, 2008; Madon et al., 1998; Robinson & Lubienski, 2011). However, these prior studies do not account for possible behavioral differences between boys and girls and thus may confound teachers' perceptions of students' achievement with their perceptions of students' classroom behavior. We disentangle these issues and show that once teachers' perceptions of behavior are ac-

counted for, girls' level of mathematics proficiency is actually underrated by teachers-we refer to this as conditional underrating because the underrating of girls is revealed when we statistically condition on (or, in some of our analyses, match on) a host of variables, including teachers' perceptions of their behavior.

Then, we extend this work by examining the extent to which this conditional underrating mediates the relation between gender and growth in math performance. Our results suggest that a substantial portion of the growth in the gender gap across the early grades may be explained by teachers' relative underrating of girls' skills. These results add to the mounting evidence that gender gaps are, at least in part, socially constructed.

# Why Focus on Gender Gaps in Math Achievement?

Some research has suggested that mathematics gender gaps are small or nonexistent (Hyde, Lindberg, Linn, Ellis, & Williams, 2008; Lindberg, Hyde, Petersen, & Linn, 2010). However, these studies also note that gender gaps may emerge at higher grade levels (Lindberg et al., 2010), among highly selective samples (Lindberg et al., 2010), or when more difficult items are included in tests (Hyde et al., 2008). When comparing these findings with those of studies using ECLS-K and National Assessment of Educational Progress data (which revealed gender gaps in elementary school), the conflicting evidence on gender achievement disparities may seem puzzling. Perhaps one reason that Hyde and colleagues (2008) found minimal gender differences is that their analyses involved state assessments, which are designed to determine whether or not students have attained state standards but are not necessarily intended to home in on the precise achievement students are capable of-thus, these state assessments may potentially suppress the gender gap. As Lindberg et al. (2010) noted, few elementary assessments contain challenging items that distinguish among students at the top end of the scale, where gender gaps are most prevalent (McGraw, Lubienski, & Strutchens, 2006; Robinson & Lubienski, 2011). In contrast, the ECLS-K math assessment uses item response theory (IRT) and an adaptive-stage design to precisely identify the achievement of students. This new evidence suggests that gender gaps do exist-at least on the content assessed by ECLS-K-and they develop during early elementary school (Fryer & Levitt, 2010; Husain & Millimet, 2009; Penner & Paret, 2008; Robinson & Lubienski, 2011). The question then turns to: Why does this gap develop?

Unlike gaps based on race and socioeconomic status (SES), which are in part attributable to differences in schools attended (Fryer & Levitt, 2004), gender gaps in elementary school are unlikely to be due to boys and girls attending different schools (Long & Conger, 2013), having different teachers within those schools, or demographic differences between boys and girls. Hence, one might suspect that gender gaps would not develop as much as race- or SES-based gaps. However, as noted above, the ECLS-K data indicate that from kindergarten to third grade, mathematics achievement gaps grow by about one quarter of a standard deviation between boys and girls, about the same amount of growth as the Black-White gap (Reardon & Robinson, 2008; see also Fryer & Levitt, 2010). Over the same period of time, the mathematics achievement gap remains relatively unchanged between students whose parents' highest degree is a high school diploma and those whose parents have college degrees (an SES

proxy); the Hispanic-White gap actually reduces in size (Reardon & Robinson, 2008). Therefore, one of the greatest growths in inequity during elementary school appears to be between boys and girls in the content area of mathematics.

The gender gap in mathematics is unique for another reason: It does not exist when students enter kindergarten. Race-based and SES-based gaps are prominent in the fall of kindergarten (Reardon & Robinson, 2008). Similarly, the gender gap in reading is present in the fall of kindergarten (favoring girls), but it narrows somewhat during elementary school (Robinson & Lubienski, 2011). Taken together, the literature suggests that something special about the experiences of boys and girls during the elementary school years contributes to the mathematics gap that emerges at that time.

#### Teacher Ratings of Girls and Boys

In examining potential origins of mathematics gender gaps, previous researchers have studied elementary school teachers' ratings of girls' and boys' mathematics abilities. The evidence, however, is mixed, with some studies concluding that teachers hold more positive views of boys' mathematics abilities and others suggesting an advantage for girls.

Earlier research on teachers' interactions with students identified ways in which boys appeared to be advantaged by teachers. Teachers tended to hold higher expectations for their male students, as was illustrated by the provision of more specific, positive feedback (Dweck, Davidson, Nelson, & Enna, 1978; Sadker & Sadker, 1986). Other studies suggested that teachers may believe that boys in general have a gift for math. In a study of 38 first-grade teachers, Fennema, Peterson, Carpenter, and Lubinski (1990) found that the teachers more often named boys as the best math students and attributed boys' success to ability and girls' success to effort. Similarly, Tiedemann (2000) found that elementary school teachers attributed students' failures to a lack of ability more for girls than for boys and attributed failure to a lack of effort more for boys than for girls. Moreover, teachers in Tiedemann's study thought that additional effort would benefit the boys more than the girls, who were already perceived by their teachers to be exerting more effort in order to reach the same achievement level as the boys.

In contrast, several recent national studies using ECLS-K data indicate that teachers rate the mathematics performance of girls more favorably than that of boys, even when boys outperform girls on a direct cognitive assessment of mathematics (e.g., Fryer & Levitt, 2010; Robinson & Lubienski, 2011). These results are consistent with a recent study of high school teachers in Israel (Lavy, 2008), as well as Madon and colleagues' (1998) study of 56 middle-school teachers in Michigan. Specifically, Madon and colleagues found that teachers rated their seventh-grade girls' performance and effort as higher than that of boys, but tended to rate their abilities equally. Similarly, there is also much research showing that girls earn higher grades (another form of teacher ratings) than boys in most school subjects, including mathematics and science, across all years of schooling (American Association of

<sup>1</sup> We acknowledge that the pattern of teacher ratings can be interpreted in multiple ways and can only be viewed as an ""underrating"" of girls when adjusting for girls' behavior and approaches to learning. This issue is discussed in more detail later in the article.

University Women Education Foundation, 2008; Catsambis, 1994; Pomerantz, Altermatt, & Saxon, 2002; Willingham & Cole, 1997). Taken together, this more recent research suggests that teachers tend to rate girls' mathematics performance higher than that of boys (but see Tiedemann, 2000).

#### ""Good Girl"" Behavior and Teacher Perceptions

One potential explanation for why girls might be perceived as more proficient in mathematics could lie in differences between teachers' perceptions of boys' and girls' behavior and effort. Prior research has revealed that there are substantial gender differences in approaches to learning and classroom behavior. Girls tend to exhibit more on-task behavior and positive approaches to learning in school (Forgasz & Leder, 2001; Ready, LoGerfo, Burkam, & Lee, 2005) and fewer ""problem behaviors,"" such as fighting (Rathbun, West, & Germino-Hausken, 2004). In other words, girls tend to be ""good girls,"" more often staying focused on classroom tasks and engaging in behaviors that please the teacher. Evidence for the apparent overrating of girls combined with evidence of gender differences in classroom behaviors raises the question of whether teachers' perceptions of gender differences in achievement may be influenced by gender differences in behavior.

In fact, this question is at the heart of the study conducted by Kenney-Benson, Pomerantz, Ryan, and Patrick (2006), who examined the relation between grades and gender differences in behavior. Their results showed that girls received higher mathematics grades, and this gender disparity could be largely explained by differences in girls' and boys' reported effort and behavior. More specifically, using a sample of 518 students in Illinois, they found that both fifth- and seventh-grade girls reported fewer disruptive behaviors and used more effective learning strategies than did boys. In addition, girls more often held mastery goals (focusing on learning), whereas boys more often held performance goals (obtaining recognition). After adjusting for disruptive classroom behaviors, learning strategies, and achievement goals, the difference between girls' and boys' grades (a measure of teachers' perceptions of competence) was reduced to marginal significance. It is unclear, however, whether teachers' assessments of students were influenced by students' behaviors or whether boys' and girls' differential behaviors led to actual differences in competence. The authors did find that although students' disruptive behaviors were correlated with both grades and test scores, the correlation with grades was stronger. They speculated that the classroom setting might reward positive behavior, whereas achievement tests may not, thus explaining why girls do better in class but not on tests. It is possible that positive learning behaviors do increase girls' mathematics competence but that teachers also factor these behaviors into their grading. The extent to which teachers intentionally reward student behavior when grading, versus conflating behavior with mathematical proficiency, is an open question.

If teachers conflate positive behavior and approaches to learning with mathematics proficiency, then findings from prior ECLS-K studies indicating that teachers overrate girls (Fryer & Levitt, 2010; Robinson & Lubienski, 2011) may be quite different when student behavior and approaches to learning are considered. In Study 1 in the current article, we addressed this question by examining how teachers view the mathematics proficiency of boys and girls who both behave and achieve similarly. However, concerns about gender biases in teachers' perceptions are arguably moot if nothing is affected by those perceptions-an issue examined in Study 2 of this article.

## Effects of Teacher Perceptions

Beginning with Rosenthal and Jacobson's (1966, 1968) classic ""Pygmalion study,"" in which teachers were told that some of their (randomly selected) students were on the verge of great intellectual growth, the idea of ""self-fulfilling prophecy"" has become widely accepted. In these studies, teachers' perceptions about students (based on random information about the student) were related to students' future performance, indicating that teachers' expectations have an effect on their students' achievement. Hundreds of replication studies have been conducted in several domains, and Rosenthal's (1994) meta-analysis of 464 studies revealed an average effect size of r = .30. Although some reviews revealed smaller effects in general (r = . 10-. 20; Jussim & Harber, 2005), and when using observational/naturalistic data in particular (Jussim, Eccles, & Madon, 1996), larger effects have been found for children in first and second grades (Raudenbush, 1984). Similar to some prior studies, we used observational data to explore the relation between teacher perceptions and student achievement. However, the focus of our study is not on the effects of teacher perceptions on achievement per se, but rather our focus is on how teacher perceptions may mediate the relation between gender and math achievement gains. The difficulty with studying mediation using observational data lies in ensuring that the estimate of the mediator is unbiased (Bullock, Green, & Ha, 2008, 2010; Bullock & Ha, 2011; Imai, Keele, Tingley, & Yamamoto, 2011; Judd & Kenny, 1981; MacKinnon, 2008; Sobel, 2009), a key principle that is often overlooked in mediation analyses (Bullock et al., 2010; Imai et al., 2011). In Study 2, we first used traditional (but potentially biased) approaches to mediation, and then we estimated mediation models that are less prone to bias.

#### The Current Research

In this article, we present two studies, each using data from the ECLS-K. In the first study, we examined whether teachers on average rate boys' or girls' mathematics proficiency higher after accounting for students' problem behavior, approaches to learning, past and current test scores, and demographic factors. That is, in Study 1 we asked, ""Above and beyond other factors, does a student's gender predict the teacher's rating of that student's mathematics proficiency?"" If teachers are conditionally underrating boys or girls-that is, rating boys' or girls' math proficiency higher, after statistically accounting for prior achievement and prior and current behaviors-we then need to understand the potential implications of teachers'over- and underestimation of students' abilities (Jussim & Harber, 2005). To address this, in the current study we also examined whether teachers' tendency to rate boys or girls higher may be linked to the widening gender gap in mathematics performance in elementary school. That is, in Study 2 we asked, ""To what extent do teachers' differential ratings of mathematics proficiency mediate the relation between gender and gains in mathematics achievement?""

# Study 1

## Method

Data set. The restricted-use ECLS-K data set provides a unique opportunity to examine the extent to which teachers differentially rate boys and girls and the role of these different ratings in the achievement gap. ECLS-K is a nationally representative data set containing information on 21,240 kindergarteners (many of whom were followed through eighth grade), collected by the U.S. D.O.E. (http://nces.ed.gov/ecls/kindergarten.asp). Data were collected in the fall of kindergarten, then again in the spring of kindergarten and Grades 1, 3, and 5. In each wave of data collection, U.S. D.O.E .- trained employees administered a psychometrically valid mathematics test,2 and each student's teacher was asked to rate the student's mathematics proficiency. Importantly, teachers and students were never informed of the student's score on the mathematics test.

Variables. The following variables were collected at each wave of data collection.

Mathematics direct cognitive assessment score. At each wave, children completed a mathematics assessment, which was developed by the Educational Testing Service based on developmentally appropriate items from widely used assessments, including the Test of Early Mathematics Ability-Third Edition (Ginsburg & Baroody, 2003), the Woodcock-Johnson III (Woodcock, Mather, & McGrew, 2001), and the Peabody Individual Achievement Test-Revised (Markwardt, 1989). Scores on this assessment were based on IRT. Students only completed some of the test items, but based on their performance on these items, the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) assigned scores that reflected the number of questions the child would have answered correctly had they completed all of the items on the assessment; these scores are referred to as IRT scale scores. The IRT scale scores were then converted to T scores at each wave. These T scores have a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10; we then converted these to z scores with a mean of zero and standard deviation of one. We chose to use T scores (converted to z scores) because these are appropriate when conducting longitudinal subgroup analyses (Tourangeau et al., 2001) and lead to more interpretable regression coefficients.

Teacher academic rating score of mathematics proficiency. At each wave, teachers rated the degree to which a child had acquired and demonstrated particular mathematical skills. They rated students on a scale from 1, indicating that the ""child has not yet demonstrated skill, knowledge, or behavior,"" to 5, showing that the ""child demonstrates skill, knowledge, or behavior competently and consistently."" Teachers rated students across multiple mathematics domains, including number, measurement, geometry, and statistics. For example, in kindergarten, teachers were asked to evaluate how proficiently the student ""Orders a group of objects,"" ""Solves problems involving numbers using concrete objects,"" ""Uses a variety of strategies to solve mathematics problems,"" and demonstrates four other specific skills. The full set of items in each wave of data collection is contained in the supplemental material (see Tables S1-S4). If the particular skill had not yet been taught in class, teachers were asked to select ""not applicable."" NCES performed Rasch analyses on the teacher rating scale in an effort to (a) create a measure for modeling growth in the teacher ratings,

(b) make the ratings more comparable to the direct cognitive assessment, and (c) estimate values for students whose teachers did not complete some items because those skills had not been taught yet. We standardized these teacher ratings within waves to have a mean of zero and standard deviation of one.

Gender. Student gender data were gathered from parent interviews, school records, and field observations. Note that ECLS-K uses the term gender instead of sex, and we maintain this language.

Race-ethnicity. The responding parent/guardian was asked to indicate the child's race and was also asked whether the child was Hispanic. ECLS-K then created eight mutually exclusive raceethnicity categories: White, non-Hispanic; Black or African American, non-Hispanic; Hispanic, race specified; Hispanic, no race specified; Asian; Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander; American Indian or Alaskan Native; and more than one race specified, non-Hispanic.

SES. This family/household variable is a continuously valued composite of father/male guardian's education; mother/female guardian's education; father/male guardian's occupational prestige; mother/female guardian's occupational prestige; and household income. ECLS-K reports that the composite components were highly correlated, and thus combining them into a single SES composite is a reasonable strategy. The SES composite has a mean of zero and standard deviation of one.

Age at assessment. This variable is the difference between the date when the student was assessed by the ECLS-K test administrator and the child's date of birth. Date of birth was gathered from parent interviews and from school records and is only available in the restricted-use data set.

Externalizing problem behavior. Teachers completed the Externalizing Problem Behavior scale (Tourangeau et al., 2001) for each participating student. Students were rated on a 4-point scale (1 = never, 2 = sometimes, 3 = often, 4 = very often) for the following items: argues, fights, gets angry, acts impulsively, disturbs ongoing activities, and (for Grades 3 and 5 only) talks during quiet study time. ECLS-K combined responses on these items into a single scale. Split-half reliabilities for the Externalizing Problem Behavior scale were between .86 and .90 across kindergarten through Grade 5.

Approaches to learning. Each teacher completed the ""approaches to learning"" scale for each of her or his students. The 4-point scale (1 = never, 2 = sometimes, 3 = often, 4 = very often) contains the following items: shows eagerness to learn new things, works independently, keeps belongings organized, easily adapts to changes in routine, persists in completing tasks, pays attention well, and (for Grades 3 and 5 only) follows classroom rules. ECLS-K combined these items into a single scale. Split-half reliabilities for the approaches to learning scale ranged between .89 and .91 from kindergarten to Grade 5.

Participants. We restrict our analyses to students who have valid test scores and teacher ratings in all relevant time periods, as well as valid behavior and learning-approaches data. For any given wave, individuals needed valid data for the current wave and all previous waves. Finally, because our preferred analyses account for observable and unobservable teacher characteristics through the use of

teacher fixed effects (i.e., indicator variables for each teacher), we restrict our analyses to classrooms in which at least one boy and one girl were sampled. The final analytic data set in the spring of kindergarten contains 9,223 students and 1,575 teachers; the sample in the spring of first grade contains 6,658 students and 1,439 teachers; the sample in the spring of third grade includes 3,919 students and 923 teachers; and the sample in the spring of fifth grade includes 1,099 students and 329 teachers.3 There was no evidence of gender-based differential attrition between grades.

All analyses use the NCES-provided sampling weights to ensure the results are nationally representative. Further, all analyses adjust the standard errors for clustering of students within classrooms and account for heteroskedasticity using cluster and robust options in Stata.

Analytic approach. In this study, we investigate whether teachers rate girls differently than boys in mathematics, after conditioning on a set of covariates. For a naïve estimate, we first explore this question by regressing current teacher ratings on gender. This is achieved through a basic weighted least squares regression. Then we sequentially add covariates to the model to statistically account for differences between boys and girls in terms of age, race, SES, prior achievement, prior and current externalizing problem behavior, prior and current approaches to learning, and current achievement. After adding these covariates, we then see whether teachers rate girls or boys higher, conditional on these factors. The standard errors for these and all subsequent analyses have been appropriately adjusted to account for clustering of students within classrooms.

#### Results and Discussion

Table 1 displays descriptive statistics for the key variables by grade level and gender. As can be seen, there is no gender difference in math test performance in the spring of kindergarten, but a small gender gap appears in first grade, and this gap grows larger

by third and fifth grades. Correlations between all key variables are displayed in Table 2.

When looking at raw differences (the first vertical bar in each period in Figure 1), teachers appear to rate the mathematics skills of girls higher than those of boys in the spring of kindergarten, but not in later periods; in fact, teachers rate boys' mathematics skills higher in third and fifth grades, which mirrors patterns in students' test scores. After we condition on demographic factors and prior mathematics achievement (the third bar in each period), teachers no longer rate boys higher in Grades 3 and 5.4 These results appear to be gender neutral, as teachers rate boys and girls with equal prior math achievement similarly in Grades 1-5. Still, once we also account for behavior, approaches to learning, prior teachers' ratings of mathematics proficiency, and current mathematics achievement, teachers rate girls' mathematics proficiencies lower than those of boys in each grade. Across the periods, the average amount of this underrating was about 0.1 standard deviations. In other words, teachers rate boys higher than girls after accounting for achievement and their perceptions of students' classroom behaviors.

How to interpret this ""conditional underrating"" of girls is a bit of a conundrum: When we condition on prior achievement,

<sup>3</sup> The main focus of the article was on mathematics achievement; however, for comparison purposes, we estimate similar models for reading achievement. The sample sizes for reading achievement are as follows: in the spring of kindergarten, 10,885 students and 1,810 teachers; in the spring of first grade, 8,279 students and 1,709 teachers; in the spring of third grade, 4,946 students and 1,122 teachers; and in the spring of fifth grade, 3,795 students and 841 teachers.

<sup>4</sup> When we also condition on current achievement at this step, we get the same results. However, we chose to not include current achievement at this point because it is impossible to tease apart the causal ordering of current achievement and current teacher ratings, and thus it is best to not include this variable until all other variables have been taken into account.

gender is not a significant predictor of teacher ratings. One might assume this outcome is equitable because we see no gender gap in teacher ratings when boys and girls are equated in terms of prior achievement. Extending this logic, if teacher ratings of math proficiency are truly not gender-biased, there should be no difference between boys' and girls' ratings when boys and girls are equated in terms of even more variables (e.g., perceptions of behavior and approaches to learning). That is, the more similar boys and girls are in terms of various factors

(e.g., prior performance, behavior, approaches to learning, race, SES, age), the smaller the absolute differences in teacher perceptions of boys and girls should become. However, contrary to this logic, this is precisely the point when gender differences emerge. This suggests that teachers' ratings of math proficiency are influenced by student gender per se, above and beyond factors such as achievement and behavior. By the standard for equity just described, finding this lack of gender neutrality suggests gender inequity in teachers' conditional ratings.

One explanation for the pattern could be that teachers have an inflated sense of girls' behavior and therefore teachers perceive girls as working harder than they really are. Alternatively, the opposite might be true-that is, teachers may hold girls to a higher standard and thus rate their behavior at least as harshly as boys. Regardless, the results indicate that teachers do tend to conflate their ratings of students' behavior with their ratings of students' mathematics proficiency, and on average, teachers must perceive girls as working harder than similarly achieving boys in order to rate them equally. As is shown in Study 2, teachers' tendency to ""conditionally underrate"" girls appears to be detrimental to girls' mathematics learning.

It is worth noting that we also explored whether teachers rate racial and ethnic minorities differently when they perform and behave similarly; unlike our findings for gender, there was no consistent evidence suggesting differences in teacher ratings of similar students of different races-ethnicities.5 We also found that when rating similar boys and girls in reading/literacy, teachers do not exhibit gender-biased rating differentials (see Figure 2). Thus, this conditional underrating appears to be specific to girls in the content area of mathematics, suggesting that student gender influences teachers' ratings of the mathematics performance of otherwise similarly performing and behaving boys and girls.

It is also important to point out that over 98% of kindergarten teachers in the data set are women. The corresponding percentages for Grades 1, 3, and 5 are 98%, 94%, and 82%, respectively. Interestingly, when exploring whether this underrating phenomenon varies by teacher gender, we found that, if anything, female teachers are more likely than are male teachers to underrate the mathematics performance of girls in Grades 3 (p = . 021) and 5 (p = . 138).6 Although the number of male teachers is large enough to detect some evidence of teacher-gender differences in rating behavior in Study 1, the instrumental-variables approach of Study 2 would require a much larger sample of male teachers to estimate precise mediation estimates by teacher gender. Thus, we proceed with estimating the average mediation estimate of teacher perceptions on the gender gap growth rather than estimating mediation by teacher gender. Yet, because female teachers constitute the vast majority of teachers, the results reported in this article primarily reflect the tendency of female teachers to conditionally underrate girls' mathematics proficiency.

# Study 2

After demonstrating in Study 1 that teachers tend to rate the mathematics proficiency of girls lower than that of boys after accounting for differences in achievement and their perceptions of students' behavior, we now turn to the question of whether this tendency to conditionally underrate girls mediates the relation between gender and gains in mathematics achievement. There are several analytic difficulties to be overcome when examining this issue, and the various methods used to address these difficulties have their trade-offs. Here, we present a series of models, ranging

<sup>5</sup> One may also be interested in the tendency for teachers to rate boys and girls differently across race groups (i.e., Gender × Race interactions) and SES levels (i.e., Gender × SES interactions), and the three-way interactions of gender, race, and SES. As a series of supplemental analyses, we explored these interactions, finding that about 5% of them were statistically significant (a percentage that could occur by chance). Across the various waves of analysis, there were no consistent patterns among that 5% (e.g., an interaction that was significant in first grade was not significant in any other grades). Although no consistent evidence of interaction exists in our study, researchers may want to pursue interaction effects with larger samples of minority students.

<sup>6</sup> This conclusion was based on differences between male and female teachers in their tendency to rate girls lower than similar boys. Specifically, these p values are based on the heteroskedastic-robust value cross-level interactions between teacher gender and student gender in hierarchical linear model regressions of teacher rating on teacher gender, student gender, their interaction, race, age, prior and current behavior and learning approaches, and prior teacher ratings and mathematics test scores.

from the more familiar and straightforward to those that are more novel and complex. We ultimately show that all such models point toward the same conclusion-that teacher perceptions do contribute to gender disparities in mathematics achievement.

## Method

Just as in Study 1, we approach this question using the ECLS-K data set. We begin by using regression models to estimate current achievement as a function of gender, age, and prior achievementthese models provide us with an estimate of the gender gap growth within each period (e.g., from the spring of kindergarten to the spring of first grade), adjusting only for age at assessment (see Model 1 in Figure 3). Then, we add a series of covariates to the regression models, to condition on race-ethnicity, SES, prior and current teacher ratings of behavior, and prior and current teacher ratings of approaches to learning (Model 2). Thus, the estimate of the gender gap growth in Model 2 is the conditional growth in the gender gap before accounting for mediation through teacher ratings of students' mathematics proficiency (represented by path c+ in Model 2). We then examine the extent to which teacher perceptions mediate the relation between achievement gains and gender.

In the next three subsections, we present three different approaches to mediation and discuss the merits of each. First, we discuss what we term the conventional approach to mediation, which would use the current teacher rating (or perhaps, prior teacher rating) as the mediating variable. As we discuss below, such an approach is limited and may yield biased estimates. Second, we discuss mediation incorporating instrumental variables, as a way to address the shortcomings of the conventional mediation approach. In that subsection, we also discuss what instrumental variables are and how we use them in this study. In the third and final subsection, we present an improvement to the instrumental variables approach, in which we match boys and girls in terms of prior achievement and behavior variables and then perform an instrumental variables-based mediation analysis on the matched sample. The initial matching stage allows us to rely on less statistical adjustment in the mediation analysis with instrumental variables, which is desirable because it makes fewer modeling assumptions.

Conventional approach to mediation. We begin with the most obvious approach, which is to perform a standard mediation analysis using the current teacher rating as the mediator, and then examine the remaining growth in the gender gap that is unexplained by the model (Model 3). The problem with this approach is that the teacher ratings and achievement scores were collected by ECLS-K at the same time, and thus the estimate of the mediation effect will exhibit simultaneity bias because it is unclear which occurred first (the teacher rating or the achievement gains). With a biased estimate of the mediator, we will also obtain a biased estimate of the gender gap growth that is left over after the biased mediator is accounted for (Bullock et al., 2008, 2010; Bullock & Ha, 2011; Imai et al., 2011; Judd & Kenny, 1981; MacKinnon, 2008; Sobel, 2009). Another approach to conventional mediation uses the prior teacher rating (instead of the current teacher rating) as a mediator of the gender gap growth because the prior period ratings obviously occurred before the current period gains, thus alleviating concerns about simultaneity bias (Model 4). However, prior teacher ratings are unlikely to explain much of the gender gap growth in the current period because, by definition, the prior teachers are not the direct influence on students-rather, the current teachers are. Thus, by using prior teacher ratings as the mediator, the growth in the gender gap that is due to teacher ratings (including current ratings) will be underestimated because prior ratings are a poor substitute for current teacher ratings.

In sum, the advantage of the approach in Model 3 is that it includes current teacher ratings as the mediator, and these ratings are most likely to influence current gender gap growth; however,

the disadvantage is that the estimates are susceptible to simultaneity bias. The advantage of Model 4 is that it circumvents concerns of simultaneity bias by using prior teacher ratings as the mediator; however, the disadvantage is that it does not include the current teacher ratings, and will thus likely not capture the full extent of mediation due to teacher ratings.

Mediation incorporating instrumental variables (IVs). All together, the problems encountered in these two initial mediation approaches (Models 3 and 4) suggest we need a source of variation in current teacher ratings that was determined prior to and independent of the current period of test score growth-once such a source is identified, we can obtain an unbiased estimate of the mediator (current teacher perceptions) on current growth in the gender gap (Bullock et al., 2008, 2010). By using an IV approach to predict current ratings on the basis of predetermined IVs (Model 5), we can obtain unbiased estimates. IVs are sets of variables that can be used to carve out as-if random variation in the predictor of interest (i.e., current teacher ratings). To be valid, IVs must meet several criteria: (a) they must be correlated with the predictor of interest and (b) they must not have a direct effect on the outcome of interest, although they may have an indirect effect on the outcome through the predictor of interest (Imbens & Angrist, 1994; for an introduction to IV, see Murnane & Willett, 2011). In our study, we demonstrate that these two criteria are plausibly satisfied, and thus the IV approach to mediation is valid.

Two different sets of IVs are used in this study's two components, which we refer to as Study 2A and Study 2B. Figure 4 provides an overview of Study 2A and Study 2B, and how the various mediation models fit within the context of the substudies. We begin by describing our first set of IVs (used in Study 2A): teachers' ratings of a student's mathematics proficiency from all time points prior to the current period. Although prior teachers affect student achievement while the student is in their classrooms, past research suggests little or no lasting direct effect of prior teachers' ratings on the student's current achievement after ac-

counting for prior achievement and other factors (Jussim & Harber, 2005; we also find no evidence of lasting direct effects, as we discuss later). However, we argue-and will demonstrate laterthat there is an indirect effect: That is, prior teachers may influence the current teachers' perceptions (e.g., through notes in a student's cumulative file, conversations between teachers), and, in turn, current teacher perceptions may affect student mathematics performance. Because the prior teacher ratings (i.e., the IVs) affect current teacher perceptions but otherwise have no direct effect on current student gains, they can serve as IVs and provide us with an unbiased mediator in a real-world context (see also Imai et al., 2011, who discuss a related IV approach to mediation analysis). Because there is no direct effect of prior teacher ratings on outcomes and because these prior ratings occur before the onset of the current teacher's in-class experiences with the student, this IV approach circumvents typical pitfalls of using observational data (e.g., reverse causality/simultaneity bias, selection bias).7 The IV mediation model (Model 5) can be decomposed into two steps: First, the current teacher ratings are predicted by all the covariates included in Model 2 (prior achievement, race, SES, age, teachers' ratings of behavior and approaches to learning) and the IVs. Second, the predicted value of the current teacher rating from this analysis is used as the mediator of the relation between gender and growth in math performance.

Study 2B differs from Study 2A in two main respects. First, in contrast with our use of all prior teachers' ratings of mathematics proficiency as the IVs in Study 2A, in Study 2B we use only the

<sup>7</sup> Conveniently, this approach taps into the effects of teacher perceptions that are influenced by prior teacher perceptions (net of other variables in the model), leaving behind differences in teacher perceptions that may be driven from other sources that may be susceptible to selection bias. Because the IV estimate taps into the ""compliance"" of current ratings with prior ratings, it is sometimes referred to as the complier average treatment effect or the local average treatment effect (Imbens & Angrist, 1994).

### Table 3

Evidence of Instrument Validity, by Strategy (IV or PSM + IV), Study, Wave, and Use of Fixed Effects

Note. IV-FE = IV models with teacher fixed effects. These models correspond to Models 5 and 6 in Figures 3 and 4. IV validity statistics demonstrate (a) whether the IVs strongly predict the treatment [Strength ] (ideal: reject null that there is evidence of a direct effect of the IVs on student achievement gains [ (ideal: fail to reject null that there is no direct effect). ( ! ) indicates the third-grade IV-FE model includes spring of kindergaten teacher ratings in the outcome model as well, but we include an interaction between the prior ratings as an added instrument (similar results obtained without this interaction). Importantly, note that all models pass both IV validity tests.

most recent prior teacher's ratings of mathematics proficiency. This approach does not require a long history of prior teacher ratings (only the most recent), which has the advantage of allowing for an expanded sample of students with nonmissing data. Second, in Study 2B we treat the most recent prior teacher's rating of externalizing problem behavior as an additional IV (instead of a standard covariate, as it was used in Study 2A). We argue that the prior teacher's perceptions of the child's behavior in this second set of IVs is intuitively valid because this perception of behavior (net of other variables, including the current teacher's perceptions of the child's behavior) likely captures bias in excess of bias reflected in ratings of proficiency. For example, there could be bias reflecting a ""reputation"" a student may have for misbehaving, which is unrelated to academics but that nevertheless influences teachers' general perceptions about the student. In addition, we demonstrate next that both sets of IVs-the set in Study 2A and the new set in Study 2B-pass standard empirical tests assessing the validity of IVs. Thus, the analyses we discuss provide plausibly unbiased estimates of mediation in a real-world setting.

As noted previously, in order for a set of IVs to be valid in this study, two conditions have to hold: (a) the IVs must affect the current teacher's rating of the student's mathematics proficiency and (b) the IVs must have no direct effect on mathematics achievement gains. If these conditions hold, then two empirical results should be obtained in our case: First, the IVs should predict current

teacher ratings, above and beyond the other variables in the model. This is assessed by an F test on the joint significance of the IVs in the first-stage equation, the one predicting the current teacher ratings (Stock & Yogo, 2005). Second, there should be no significant direct effect of the IVs on the mathematics test gains. This is assessed by a post hoc test of whether the IVs (by definition, excluded from the second-stage estimation model) have unique power in predicting mathematics gains in the second-stage equation and, therefore, should have been included in the model as covariates and not as IVs (Hansen's J test; Hansen, 1982). Table 3 suggests that, in each wave of analysis and across the overall and within-classroom specifications, both sets of IVs satisfy both criteria. That is, for each of the eight IV analyses performed, the IVs (a) predict current teacher ratings (ps < . 0001 across all models) and (b) have no significant effect on student achievement gains other than through their effect on the current teacher's perceptions (.19 < ps < 1.0). All of these tests support the validity of our analyses.

Propensity score matching, followed by mediation incorporating instrumental variables (PSM + IV). Finally, we perform an analysis similar to the IV analyses discussed above, but with one difference: Before performing the mediation analysis, we first match boys and girls in terms of age, race-ethnicity, family SES, prior achievement, and teachers' perceptions of behavior and approaches to learning (Model 7 in Figure 3; note that Model 6 is the baseline model using the matched sample before mediation for the PSM + IV analysis, just as Model 2 was the baseline model for the IV analysis). That is, we use PSM (Rosenbaum & Rubin, 1984) to identify boys and girls with nearly identical values of behavior and prior performance, among other variables. For details on the matching process, see the Appendix. Using the matched sample, we then see whether teachers rate the math abilities of boys or girls higher. 8 Then, just as in the IV analyses described above, we perform our mediation analysis using the IVs to predict current teacher ratings.

This approach to mediation (i.e., PSM, followed by IV) has clear advantages over the approaches discussed above, especially the conventional approach to mediation. In addition to the benefits of the IV approach over the conventional approach to mediation (e.g., addressing concerns of simultaneity bias), the PSM + IV approach has the added benefit of beginning the mediation analysis with a sample of boys and girls who have nearly identical means and variances on each of the covariates included as ""control variables."" Matching first is particularly beneficial when the groups being compared (e.g., boys and girls) differ substantially on the covariates included in the regression model. Specifically, models that rely on covariate adjustment (as Models 1-5 do) can yield biased estimates when the mean values of the groups' propensity scores differ by more than 0.5 standard deviations (Rubin, 2001). In our case, boys' and girls' propensity score mean values differ by more than 0.68 standard deviations in all analyses (see Tables S 17-S20 in the supplemental material). Thus, if the assumptions of the regression model are not satisfied (e.g., if the functional form of the regression is not correctly specified), then the large covariate differences between boys and girls can lead to biased estimates. However, with PSM, rather than relying on statistical adjustment of the large differences between boys and girls on variables such as behavior and approaches to learning, we first identify boys and girls with nearly equivalent values and use them in our mediation analysis.10 In addition, this matching approach makes the analysis more transparent in two ways: (a) simplifying the analyses so that one can see the underrating of girls when matched to nearly identical boys and (b) reducing the reliance on statistical adjustment in the IV mediation, and thereby reducing a dimension of the conceptual complexity of the IV mediation. Along with the IV approach, we use the PSM + IV approach in Studies 2A and 2B. Table 3 provides evidence suggesting that the use of IVs in the PSM + IV approach is valid in all eight PSM + IV models.

Participants. For analyses using the first set of IVs (i.e., all prior teacher ratings of math proficiency), the ECLS-K participants are identical to those used in Study 1: there were 6,658 students in the first-grade analysis (i.e., gender gap growth from the spring of kindergarten to the spring of first grade) and 3,919 students in the third-grade analysis (i.e., gender gap growth from the spring of first grade to the spring of third grade). As noted above, the second set of IVs does not require a lengthy history of teacher ratings, thus allowing us to expand the sample to students who had missing data and could not be included in the IV analyses in Study 2A. The final sample for Study 2B is 9,362 students in the kindergarten to first-grade analysis, and 5,733 students in the first- to third-grade analysis. 11

### Results and Discussion

Table 4 provides the results for Study 2A. For parsimony, we focus our discussion on the within-classroom estimates (i.e., models with teacher fixed effects), which are more methodologically rigorous; note, though, that the results of models without fixed effects are similar to those with fixed effects. We begin by showing the growth in the gender gap when only accounting for prior achievement and age at times of assessment. For example, Model 1 shows that girls' achievement in first grade is, on average, 0.070 standard deviations lower than boys, conditional on prior achievement and age, and when comparing boys and girls within the same classroom. In other words, on average, girls lose ground to boys by about 0.070 standard deviations between the spring of kindergarten and first grade. Between the spring of first and third grades, they lose more ground to boys, about 0.162 standard deviations. Model 2 shows that, on average, girls lose about 0.153 and 0.236 standard deviations in comparison to boys over these periods, respectively, when conditioned on multiple variables (e.g., age, race-ethnicity, prior and current behavior and approaches to learning, and prior mathematics achievement scores) but not including teacher ratings.

The mediation results begin with Model 3, which used current teacher ratings as the mediator of the gender gap. Model 4 used prior teacher ratings as the mediator. As previously mentioned, these conventional approaches may provide biased estimates and understate the true extent of mediation, and thus we focus on Model 5, which uses an IV approach to predict current teacher ratings based on prior teacher ratings. After accounting for the predicted current teacher rating and prior achievement, girls score 0.080 standard deviations lower than boys. Compared with the model not accounting for mediation (i.e., Model 2), Model 5 suggests that the predicted teacher ratings mediate almost half (48%) of the relation between gender and achievement gains between the spring of kindergarten and first grade.

<sup>8</sup> Recall that in Study 1, we examined whether teachers rated boys' or girls' math ability higher after conditioning on a host of covariates. Here, we are performing an analogous procedure, but instead of conditioning on a host of variables, we match on them. The differences in teachers' perceptions of boys' and girls' math abilities from this matching approach were very similar to those from the conditioning approach in Study 1. To see this. look at the coeffieicnt estimate on female from the IV-FF. (fixed effects) Stage 1 columns in Tables S21-S22 in the supplemental material.

<sup>9</sup> The propensity score can be viewed as a composite measure of the covariates included in the model. As can be seen in Tables S17-S20, the variables with the greatest differences between boys and girls are externalizing problem behavior (> 0.37 SDs across all externalizing behavior variables and waves) and approaches to learning (> 0.40 SDs across all approaches to learning variables and waves).

<sup>10</sup> One drawback here could be that we may not find suitable matches for some students, and thus our sample may become nonrepresentative. Fortunately, we were able to identify suitable matches (i.e., matches within 0.25 SDs of the propensity score; Rosenbaum & Rubin, 1985) for all but four students across all waves and studies (Studies 2A and 2B). Hence, our sample remains representative.

<sup>11</sup> Although we demonstrated in Study 1 that teachers underrate girls relative to boys in fifth grade as well, we cannot explore how teacher perceptions affect growth in the gender gap from third to fifth grade because the sets of instruments have low predictive power. That is, the first-stage F statistics on the instruments are considerably below the acceptable thresholds established by Stock and Yogo (2005).

Study 2A: Female-Male Standardized Differences in Mathematics Achievement, Conditional on Prior-Period Achievement

Note. WLS = weighted least squares; IV = instrumental variables; PSM = propensity score matching; SES = socioeconomic status. Numbers in square brackets are model numbers. Heteroskedastic-robustered at the teacher level appear in parentheses to the right of the estimates. X indicates these covariates are included For all regression coefficients (not just the ""female"" coefficient) and model statistiss, see Tables S9-S12 and S21-S22 in the supplemental materials.

Next, we turn to the period from spring of first grade to third grade. Compared with the model not accounting for mediation (i.e., Model 2), Model 5 suggests that the predicted teacher ratings mediate almost 85% of the relation between gender and achievement gains between the spring of first grade and third grade (i.e., from -0.236 to -0.036).

Despite differing in terms of samples, covariates, and IVs, we find that the patterns from Study 2B (see Table 5) are remarkably similar to those from Study 2A (see Table 4). This is true for not only the first-grade patterns but also the third-grade patterns. For example, comparing the estimates with and without mediation using IV (i.e., Model 2 vs. Model 5), the estimated growth in the gender gap from kindergarten to first grade reduced 46% (from −0.155 to −0.083) in Study 2B, similar to the reduction of 48% (from -0.153 to -0.080) in Study 2A. The first- to third-grade gender gap growth estimate reduced by 66% (from -0.259 to -0.087) in Study 2B, which is a somewhat smaller reduction than the 85% (from -0.236 to -0.036) in Study 2A. Note, too, that the portion mediated in each of these models is statistically significant, as determined by mediation analyses with bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals (MacKinnon, 2008; see Figures 5 and S1). Thus, the IV-based mediation analyses in Studies 2A and 2B all suggest that teachers' perception that boys are more proficient in mathematics than equally behaving and achieving girls mediates a sizable portion of the growth in the early gender gap in mathematics.

The results from mediation analyses using PSM and IVs (PSM + IV) were remarkably similar to the results of the IV analyses just discussed; this is true across the grades examined, whether the models used teacher fixed effects, and whether we used the IVs from Study 2A or Study 2B. That is, whether we performed the IV mediation using covariate adjustment only (i.e., comparing Models 2 and 5) or using matching first (i.e., comparing Models 6 and 7), the results suggest that roughly the same amount of the relation between math achievement gains and gender is mediated by teacher perceptions. For example, in Study 2A with teacher fixed effects (see Table 4), using the IV approach the estimated growth in the gender gap reduced by 48% (from -0.153

in Model 2 to -0.080 in Model 5), whereas the same gap growth using the PSM + IV approach was estimated to reduce by 42% (from -0.156 in Model 6 to -0.091 in Model 7). Between first and third grade, the Study 2A PSM + IV mediation analyses with teacher fixed effects suggested that 81% of the relation between gender and achievement gains was mediated by predicted teacher ratings. In Study 2B (see Table 5), the PSM + IV models estimated that 49% and 66% of the relations between gender and achievement gains in the kindergarten-to-first-grade and firstgrade-to-third-grade periods, respectively, were explained by predicted teacher ratings. Tables 4 and 5 provide the mediation analyses for all PSM + IV analyses (with and without teacher fixed effects), and Figure 5 illustrates the PSM + IV mediation analyses for the models with teacher fixed effects-we believe the models in Figure 5 present the best estimations of mediation in this article because they reduce bias through matching, IVs, and fixed effects. Note that all mediated paths are statistically significant.

#### General Discussion

Contrary to recent suggestions that teachers hold more positive assessments of girls' mathematics performance, we find in a nationally representative sample that teachers rate the mathematics skills of girls lower than those of boys, after accounting for differences in achievement and teachers' ratings of behavior. That is, after accounting for mathematics achievement histories, behavior, approaches to learning, race, age, SES, and even looking at boys and girls in the same classrooms (in the teacher fixed effects models), girls' skills are rated to be about one tenth of a standard deviation lower than those of their boy classmates. This pattern is consistent throughout elementary school.

Put another way, the results suggest that teachers rate girls on par with similarly achieving boys only if they perceive those girls as working harder and behaving better than those boys. It is important to note that there is no evidence of a similar ratings disadvantage for Black or Hispanic students (relative to White students in the same classroom) and that there is no evidence

that girls are rated lower or higher in reading after accounting for these factors. This indicates that the teacher underrating phenomenon is unique to girls and mathematics performance.

This study makes an important, and methodologically rigorous, contribution to the literature on the implications of teachers' perceptions. The consistency of the findings across eight different estimation strategies (Studies 2A and 2B, the IV and PSM + IV approaches within each substudy, each estimated with and without teacher fixed effects), as well as the consistent evidence supporting the validity of both IV approaches (see Table 3), provides strong

evidence that gender-biased perceptions mediate much of the early development of the gender gap.

### Potential Limitations

Our studies have several limitations worth noting. First, although Study 2 suggests that teachers' perceptions likely affect student learning, our analyses cannot speak to the precise mechanisms through which these effects operate. We speculate about these mechanisms later in the article.

Second, the analyses in Study 2 are not based on experimental designs. Thus, teacher expectations were not randomly assigned. Although we have argued that the use of prior teacher ratings provide a source of exogenous variation and thus yield less biased estimates than conventional mediation approaches, and although

the consistency of findings across the different approaches taken and across the different waves of data in Study 2 bolsters confidence in our conclusions, we cannot be certain that all bias has been purged from the estimates.

Third, because perceptions were not randomly assigned to teachers, it is possible that part of what we are terming teachers'gender-biased perceptions is attributable to peer, parent, and societal gender-biased perceptions. However, although these other (i.e., nonteacher) factors may contribute to the gender gap, it is doubtful that they explain the majority of the specific estimates of ""teacher perceptions"" reported here. The teacher rating of student proficiency is not simply an attitudinal measure (e.g., agreement with ""boys are naturally better at math""), but rather is a detailed set of ratings of individual students' proficiency in specific mathematics domains (see Tables S1-S4 in the supplemental material). Nevertheless, because the ECLS-K data set does not contain data on the gendered beliefs of these students' parents or peers, we cannot empirically examine their associations with the teachers' ratings of student mathematics proficiency.

Finally, the conclusions we draw from this research pertain to teachers' perceptions of girls' effort, rather than girls' actual effort. Some smaller scale research suggests that teachers might overestimate the degree to which girls actually work harder than boys (e.g., Madon et al., 1998). Hence, it is possible that teachers' perceptions of girls' additional effort identified in this study are somewhat inaccurate. However, evidence from ECLS-K student surveys indicates that girls and boys themselves report differential behavior (e.g., the exhibition of ""problem behaviors"") that is aligned with ECLS-K teacher reports (Rathbun et al., 2004). Thus, although girls may indeed be working harder than boys (and therefore, it is not just a perception that they are working harder), we only have a measure of teachers' perceptions, and that is why we have used terms such as perceptions of differences throughout the current article.

Given these limitations, we are cautious in concluding that growth in gender gaps in mathematics achievement would necessarily be reduced by 35%-85% if teachers judged similarly achieving and behaving boys and girls as mathematically similar. Exact percentages aside, this study does suggest that teachers' perceptions mediate the growing gender gap in mathematics achievement during early elementary school.

# Teacher Perceptions and Gender: Unanswered Questions

Despite the limitations noted above, using large-scale, nationally representative data in this study, we found that teachers tend to rate the mathematics proficiency of girls lower than that of boys after accounting for achievement and behavior and that this tendency appears to partially account for the growing mathematics gender gap that favors boys during elementary school. These findings add to the mounting evidence of ways in which gender gaps are socially constructed (Beilock et al., 2010; Else-Quest et al., 2010; Halpern et al., 2007) and point toward teachers' perceptions of boys and girls as one important factor influencing gender gaps in early grades. However, our study raises, but does not answer, two additional questions of importance. First, it is unclear why teacher ratings of students' mathematics proficiency are skewed by gender, and second, it is unclear how those skewed teacher perceptions actually influence boys' and girls' achievement. Given the limitations of our data, we can only speculate about potential explanations, suggesting directions for future research.

Potential reasons for gender-biased pattern in teacher ratings. Given the importance of teachers' perceptions of the boys and girls in their mathematics classes, we need to understand more about how those perceptions are shaped. Specifically, why do teachers have to perceive girls as working harder in order to rate them as equally mathematically proficient to boys? In addition to biases potentially stemming from general societal stereotypes about who is good at mathematics, elementary teachers of mathematics may have two additional sources of bias that merit further exploration: teachers' own experiences as learners of mathematics and teachers' experiences with students in their classrooms.

First, the vast majority of elementary teachers are women and may be prone to mathematics anxiety (Beilock et al., 2010). In our analysis, we found that the gender-biased pattern in teacher ratings was stronger for female teachers than for male teachers. This pattern raises the question of whether female teachers' own mathematical insecurities might shape their perceptions of the abilities of the girls and boys in their mathematics classrooms.

Second, perhaps teachers' observations of the students in their classrooms have skewed their perceptions of boys' and girls' mathematics abilities. As noted previously, some research on student motivation suggests that boys are more likely to hold performance goals, whereas girls more often pursue mastery goals (Kenney-Benson et al., 2006). Hence, boys focus more on publicly exhibiting their knowledge (or ""showing off"") in the mathematics classroom, and are more likely than girls to volunteer answers and get teacher feedback (Li, 1999; Sadker & Sadker, 1986). In addition, as early as first grade, boys have been found to use more novel approaches to solving problems (Fennema, Carpenter, Jacobs, Franke, & Levi, 1998; see also Tiedemann, 2000). Thus, these types of behaviors may lead teachers to perceive boys as ""mathematically smarter"" than girls. Furthermore, we cannot ignore the fact that girls appear to work harder than boys, on average, despite the fact that boys actually make larger math gains during elementary school (Forgasz & Leder, 2001; Ready et al., 2005). Hence, on one hand, it is not surprising that teachers would assume that boys can achieve more with less effort-a belief that might underlie the patterns found here. However, our results suggest that teachers go beyond what is warranted in assuming that the achievement of boys is higher than girls with similar levels of effort, even when their achievement does not differ.

Mechanisms through which teacher perceptions influence boys' and girls' achievement. Just as this study cannot determine the specific causes of teachers' differential perceptions of boys' and girls' abilities, the data do not lend themselves to exploring the precise mechanisms through which these perceptions operate. However, prior research suggests a number of ways in which teacher expectations are conveyed to students and might ultimately impact student performance.

Some research suggests that teachers' feedback to students may be the mechanism through which expectations are communicated. For example, Dweck and colleagues (1978) found that boys were more likely than girls to receive positive feedback that highlighted the intellectual quality of their work, whereas girls were more often praised for nonintellectual aspects. They linked this pattern to girls' greater tendency to attribute failure to lack of ability. Similarly, Sadker and Sadker (1986) found that teachers gave more attention to boys than girls and provided more specific feedback to boys. Given that self-efficacy, which promotes academic success, is positively related to frequent and immediate feedback provided to students (Pajares, 2002), and given that girls' self-efficacy is particularly likely to be influenced by others' assessments of them (Usher & Pajares, 2006a, 2006b), it may well be that feedback is a potential mechanism through which perceptions affect achievement gaps.

Finally, as mentioned previously, Beilock et al.'s (2010) study suggests that female teachers' own mathematics anxiety might influence their students. Specifically, they concluded that first- and second-grade female teachers' mathematics anxiety exerts a negative influence on girls' beliefs about who is good at mathematics and ultimately on girls' mathematics achievement. Hence, even if female teachers strive to treat boys and girls equitably, their own perceptions of themselves as female learners who struggle to understand mathematics might be subtly conveyed to students during the course of instruction.

## Conclusion

The results of these studies indicate that teachers rate the mathematics proficiency of girls as equal to that of similarly achieving boys only if they perceive the girls as working harder and being better behaved than the boys. This pattern is unique to girls and mathematics, as it did not occur in reading or with other underserved groups (e.g., Black and Hispanic students) in mathematics. This tendency for teachers to underrate girls' mathematics performance relative to boys who perform and behave similarly appears to substantially mediate the development of gender achievement gaps in elementary school. Raising awareness of-and hopefully, reducing-the tendency for teachers to rate boys higher than girls who perform and behave similarly may thus help close the gender achievement gap in mathematics.

Additional insights could be gained from future research that delves further into the ways in which teachers' perceptions impact their interactions with girls and boys, and how, specifically, those interactions affect girls' and boys' mathematics self-concepts and learning. Accounting for the effects of other social influences (e.g., parents, peers, media; Eccles, 1986; Frome & Eccles, 1998; Herbert & Stipek, 2005) may further explain the growing achievement gap in elementary school and, in combination with the current study and related work, can lead to interventions that promote gender equity among even our youngest mathematicians.

### Propensity Score Matching Process

Propensity score matching proceeded in a series of steps. First, using logistic regression, we predicted each student's gender as a function of covariates such as race, socioeconomic status, behavior, approaches to learning, and prior achievement (and teacher indicators, in the models using teacher fixed effects), weighted by the sampling weight. Second, we obtained each student's predicted propensity score using the coefficient estimates from the logistic regression. Third, we matched. That is, for each girl, we found the boy with the closest propensity score; and similarly, for each boy, we found the girl with the closest propensity score. To match, we used a nearest neighbor (with replacement) strategy. And to help ensure the matches are of good quality, we used a caliper of 0.25 standard deviations of the pooled within-gender propensity score in the unmatched sample, meaning that we only retained matches that differ by less than 0.25 standard deviations of the propensity score (Rosenbaum & Rubin, 1984). Fourth, among the matched sample, we checked for balance, which here entailed three types of checks (see Rubin, 2001): (a) assessing the standardized difference between boys and girls on each covariate, with the goal being

small standardized differences after matching; (b) comparing the variance of each covariate for boys and for girls, with the goal being a covariance ratio close to 1 (smaller than .5 or greater than 2 suggest poor balance; Rubin, 2001); and (c) checking for statistically significant differences between boys and girls on covariates included in the matching, with the goal being few to no significant differences after matching. For each of our eight matched samples (i.e., Studies 2A and 2B, each with and without teacher fixed effects, and each for Grades 1 and 3), we obtained excellent balance (see Tables S17-S20 in the supplemental material). Finally, with the matched sample, we performed the mediation analysis. To adjust for any remaining (albeit small) covariate differences between boys and girls in the matched samples, we included all covariates in the final estimation stage, just as we do in Model 5 (Ho, Imai, King, & Stuart, 2007).

A longstanding tradition in the humanities holds that a writer's inspiration is infectious, but this thesis has not been tested. We hypothesized that (a) inspiration is infectious, such that inspired writers are more inspiring to the average reader; (b) contagion is mediated by the insightfulness of the text; and (c) contagion is moderated by readers' openness to experience, such that open readers are more prone to contagion. To test these hypotheses, a sample of 195 student writers, each of whom wrote 1 poem, was crossed with a sample of 220 student readers, who read all poems. Data were available for 36,020 cells of the resulting Writer × Reader matrix. Our analytic approach integrated cross-classified multilevel modeling with conditional process analysis. As hypothesized, writers who were more inspired elicited higher levels of inspiration in the average reader. Inspiration contagion was mediated by the insightfulness and pleasantness of the text and was partially suppressed by originality. Inspiration was moderated by reader openness. Moderated mediation analyses indicated that open readers were prone to contagion because they were tolerant of the originality and sublimity of inspired writing. Additional analyses differentiated contagion of inspiration from contagion of its covariates (awe, positive affect), documented effects of writer inspiration on reader enthrallment (awe, chills), and showed that writer effort is a poor predictor of reader states. The infectiousness of inspiration-through poetry, if not also through scripture and academic writing-suggests that a given instance of inspiration may have far-reaching cultural implications, including dissemination of innovations and ideologies.

Keywords: inspiration, contagion, openness to experience, cultural transmission, authenticity

The idea that a culture's greatest writings are products of inspiration, a state of heightened creative activity, has been a perennial thesis throughout the history of Western scholarship (Clark, 1997). An even more provocative version of this thesis holds that the writer's inspiration is infectious, such that inspired texts inspire their readers. Plato posited that inspiration is transmitted from the Muse, to poets, to rhapsodes (performers), and finally, to audiences (Plato, 1936). Longinus (1890), writing in approximately the 1st century AD, argued that sublime writing arises during moments of inspiration and, in turn, enthralls and inspires its readers. Judeo-Christian theology holds that God's revelation inspires prophets and apostles to write scripture, which, in turn, produces a state of illumination in readers (Geisler & Nix, 1986). Romantic poet Edward Young (1759/1918) suggested that genius inspires and is itself inspired. Fellow Romantic Shelley (1977) portrayed inspiration in the writer and inspiration in the reader as so intertwined that his descriptions blur the distinction between them (Clark, 1997).

In spite of the far-reaching implications of this venerable intellectual tradition, inspiration contagion has not yet been the subject of empirical investigation. In this study, we conduct the first test of writer-reader contagion of inspiration and related states, including awe and positive affect. We also investigate the qualities of a text that mediate contagion of each state and the traits of readers that moderate contagion effects. In the following, we identify obstacles that have precluded study of inspiration contagion to date, as well as our strategies for overcoming them.

# Obstacles to the Study of Writer-Reader Inspiration Contagion

The first obstacle, ironically, is the unusually long history of the inspiration concept, which brings connotations of muses and Romantic hyperbole (e.g., effortless creation). The typical reaction among 20th century scholars was to dismiss the topic on the basis of these associations. Recently, however, inspiration has undergone a renaissance in literary theory (Clark, 1997; Roe & Stanco, 2007) and psychological science (Jones, Dodd, & Gruber, 2014; Milyavskaya, Ianakieva, Foxen-Craft, Colantuoni, & Koestner, 2012; Thrash & Elliot, 2003). The catalyst in both fields was a recognition that descriptions of inspiration have been sufficiently consistent across history (Clark, 1997) or disciplines (Thrash & Elliot, 2003) that a scholarly treatment demands serious consideration of these consistencies. In fact, noting trends in literary theory, Clark (1997) concluded that inspiration is ""the oldest and the most contemporary theory of the genesis of the poetic"" (p. 282). We employ a contemporary, empirically validated conceptualization of inspiration (Thrash & Elliot, 2003, 2004) with the aim of documenting the continuity of inspiration, from the genesis of the poetic to its reception.

Second, the inspiration contagion narrative has been largely overshadowed by a narrative of perspiration. In defiance of Romantic conceptions of the inspired poet, Edgar Allen Poe (1846) famously portrayed writing as a matter of cold calculation. Poet Paul Valéry (1958, 2007) retained inspiration in the reader as the objective of the poet, but he argued that this end is achieved primarily through hard work rather than inspiration (see also Fehrman, 1980). Within the sciences, Martindale (2001) and Sawyer (2006) suggested that no theorist disputes Edison's claim that genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration, and Martindale (1989) stated that ""the 1% versus 99% partitioning of the 'variance' in creativity is probably close to the mark"" (p. 213). Invariably, such claims are not accompanied by references to studies in which inspiration was assessed. In the present research, we treat inspiration contagion and Valéry's rival account as hypotheses subject to empirical test.

Finally, the far-reaching topic of inspiration contagion has lacked an intellectual home, because it does not fit within the boundaries of contemporary academic literatures. Scientists have generally invoked ad hoc, domain-specific conceptualizations of inspiration as a creative (e.g., Martindale & Hasenfus, 1978) or interpersonal (e.g., Lockwood & Kunda, 1997) process, and therefore the commensurability and continuity of inspiration across writers and readers has not been apparent. This problem of conceptual fragmentation has been compounded by pressures toward methodological specialization. Wimsatt and Beardsley (1946, 1949), champions of the influential New Criticism, argued that analysis of a text cannot support valid inferences about inspiration or other states in the writer or reader. The solution advocated by these theorists was to constrict the focus of literary analysis to objective features of the text itself, relegating the study of writer or reader states to other specialized literatures (e.g., reader response theory). Unfortunately, these literatures have remained largely isolated, apparently because the integrated study of the writer, text, and reader poses unwieldy methodological challenges. Perhaps the greatest impediment to the study of inspiration contagion has been the boundary between the humanities and the sciences, which

separates theories of inspiration contagion, dating back to Plato, from the quantitative methods and models needed to test them. In the following, we present integrative solutions to these problems of conceptual, methodological, and statistical fragmentation.

## Integrative Conceptualization, Study Design, and Statistical Model

## Integrative Conceptualization of Inspiration

Thrash and Elliot (2003, 2004) have argued that diverse forms of inspiration (e.g., spiritual, creative, interpersonal) share common features. These researchers conceptualized inspiration as an epistemic-motivational episode involving two component processes: being inspired by and being inspired to. Being inspired by is an epistemic process in which one is awoken to new or better possibilities. This process may occur spontaneously during a ""eureka"" moment or may be stimulated by the environment. Being inspired to is a motivational process in which one feels compelled to bring one's new vision into fruition. Although dissociable, these processes tend to co-occur (Thrash & Elliot, 2004). Inspiration has been theorized to serve the function of motivating transmission (e.g., articulation, actualization, or extension) of ideas appraised as intrinsically valuable (Thrash & Elliot, 2004; Thrash, Moldovan, Oleynick, & Maruskin, 2014).

This general conceptualization is applicable to both the writing and reading processes. Applied to the writing process, or the creative process more generally, inspiration involves an impulse to actualize an idea in the form of a concrete product. Studies have shown that inspiration predicts indicators of creative output, including receipt of patents (Thrash & Elliot, 2003) and ratings of the creativity of poetry, fiction, and scientific essays (Thrash, Maruskin, Cassidy, Fryer, & Ryan, 2010). Consistent with the posited transmission function, creative ideation precedes inspiration, which, in turn, predicts the creativity of the resulting product (Thrash, Maruskin, et al., 2010). Writers who are more inspired report that their ideas came to them more fully formed; they write more efficiently; and they use shorter words-all suggesting a swift articulation of ideas while they are fresh in the mind's eye (Thrash, Maruskin, et al., 2010). Inspiration is also applicable to the reading process but has not been studied in this context. In this case, the written word is illuminating and awakens a desire to express or embody this new epistemic awareness.

The transmission function of inspiration should be distinguished from the inspiration contagion process investigated herein. In the transmission process, inspiration is a mediating (intervening) variable that explains the transmission of perceived intrinsic value by a single individual, such as a writer (idea -> writer inspiration -> text) or reader (text -> reader inspiration -> future goal). In the contagion process, writer and reader inspiration serve as independent and dependent variables, respectively, mediated by qualities of the text (writer inspiration -> text -> reader inspiration). Thus, the inspiration contagion process complements and extends the transmission function of inspiration, such that a given experience of inspiration has the potential to spark reverberations in others via the written word, much as Plato, Longinus, and others argued.

## Integrative Study Design

Empirical study of writer-reader contagion requires not only an integrative conceptualization of inspiration, but also an integrative study design that allows data about the writing process, text, and reading process to be linked. Our strategy was to use the poems written in a previous study of inspiration and the writing process (Thrash, Maruskin, et al., 2010, Study 3) as stimuli in a new study of inspiration and reader response. Our paradigm involves fully crossing participants from the two samples (""writers"" and ""readers""), such that each reader is asked to respond to each writer's poem. Both samples consist of undergraduate students. Poem characteristics are measured using the consensual assessment technique (Amabile, 1996), in which a panel of judges rates each poem on multiple dimensions. Merging the data sets yields the Writer × Reader data structure illustrated in Figure 1.

We acknowledge that crossing a sample of student writers with a sample of student readers cannot be expected to yield the kinds of historically important inspiration episodes discussed by Plato and other theorists who have posited inspiration contagion. Nevertheless, our strategy allows the unwieldy topic of writer-reader inspiration contagion to be broached using rigorous scientific methods. Strengths of this design include (a) sampling of writers, poems, and readers, rather than use of hand-picked exemplars; (b) multidimensional assessment of poem characteristics; (c) experimental assignment of readers to poems and the writers ""behind"" them; and (d) direct, valid, and commensurate assessment of writer and reader inspiration and known covariates. Moreover, we note that our hypotheses do not hinge on the literary sophistication of the writer and reader samples. Once romanticized as the province of the genius, inspiration is now understood to be consequential in the daily lives of all individuals (Laski, 1961; Thrash & Elliot, 2003).

#### Integrative Statistical Model

Crossing a sample of readers with a sample of writers (or, equivalently, with the corresponding sample of poems) poses statistical challenges. Responses from the same reader to different poems are nonindependent due to nesting within readers; similarly, responses to the same poem from different readers are nonindependent due to nesting within poems. These sources of nonindependence must be modeled in order to avoid violation of the independence assumption. A related consideration is that the particular readers and poems under investigation are arbitrary samples rather than exhaustive populations. Accordingly, both readers and poems must be modeled as random effects in order to permit generalization to their respective populations (Hoffman & Rovine, 2007). Crossed patterns of nonindependence and crossed random effects may be modeled appropriately using a modeling technique called cross-classified (or ""mixed effects"") multilevel modeling (Judd, Westfall, & Kenny, 2012; Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002).

Although the cross-classified multilevel model offers a rigorous way to analyze reader × poem (""person × situation"") data, it is a univariate technique-that is, it accommodates only a single dependent variable. Accordingly, it does not provide a natural way to accommodate distal effects of writer states on poem characteristics, nor indirect effects of writer states on reader states via poem characteristics (i.e., mediation). Fortunately, recent developments allow cross-classified modeling to be integrated with the multivariate technique of structural equation modeling (Asparouhov & Muthén, in press) and hence with conditional process analysisthat is, analysis of mediation, moderation, and moderated mediation (Hayes, 2013). Next we present our hypotheses, which were guided by our methodological-statistical framework and by relevant theory, thus illustrating methodological-substantive synergy (Marsh & Hau, 2007).

## Hypotheses

## Writer-Reader Contagion of Inspiration

From the perspective offered by our Writer × Reader framework, a statistical test of contagion minimally requires a single reader. In this case, contagion is present if writers who are more inspired evoke higher levels of inspiration in that single reader. However, because reader response consists of general and idiosyncratic components (Fish, 1970), we frame our contagion hypothesis in terms of the average effect across multiple readers. Thus, our contagion hypothesis specifies that, on average across readers, writer inspiration has a positive effect on reader inspiration.

## Mediation

We further posited a mediating process that explains how contagion occurs. Specifically, we hypothesized that contagion is mediated by the insightfulness of the text, such that writers who are more inspired write texts that reveal greater insight (as evaluated independently of the writers' and readers' perceptions); and texts that are more insightful, in turn, evoke higher levels of inspiration in the average reader. Our rationale is that an insightful text serves as both the output of the epistemic transmission process in the writer and as the input for an epistemic transmission process in the reader.

Insightfulness is not, in theory, the only intrinsically valuable quality that may be transmitted by inspiration. However, insightfulness is particularly relevant to writer-reader contagion because of its symmetric significance to writer and reader, a quality that we label transitivity. For sake of discrimination, we also examine a related quality-originality-that was expected not to mediate contagion because of its asymmetric significance. Although writer inspiration is known to facilitate writers' actualization (transmission) of original ideas (Thrash, Maruskin, et al., 2010), originality is unlikely to facilitate inspiration in the average reader, because original ideas are regarded as belonging to their author and not their audience (Bennett, 2005). The problem of ownership does not apply to an insightful text, which casts light upon (perceived) truths that transcend authorship.

Our theorizing regarding the problem of ownership is informed by Plato's model of contagion. The reason inspired writing was itself inspiring in Plato's model was that the writer was not the origin of ideas, but rather the mediator of the eternal wisdom of the

<sup>1</sup> Because of the 1-1 correspondence between writers and poems in our framework, we make no distinction between the sample of writers and the sample of poems. Our framework could be expanded to involve multiple poems per writer, in which case poems would be nested within writers, and both would be crossed with readers.

Muse. The Muse-daughter of Mnemosyne (memory)-may be understood as a symbol for the collective memory of many generations of orator-poets in a predominantly oral culture (Clark, 1997). Thus, the writer who catches a glimpse of eternal wisdom and serves as its transmitter invites the reader into a comparable state conducive to further inspired transmission.

## Moderation

In positing writer-reader continuity of inspiration, we do not mean to imply that inspiration spreads indiscriminately. Some readers may be more receptive than others. Accordingly, we test whether contagion is moderated by (conditional upon) reader personality.

Openness to experience from the Five Factor Model (McCrae & Costa, 1997) has been identified as the key trait that predicts proneness to inspiration (Thrash & Elliot, 2003, 2004; Thrash, Maruskin, et al., 2010). We hypothesized that contagion is moderated by reader openness, such that the effect of writer inspiration on reader inspiration is greater for readers higher in openness. This hypothesis is consistent with Plato's portrayal of poets and rhapsodes-paragons of openness-as more receptive than the general public to inspiration from the Muse.

## Contagion of Related States

Although not yet investigated, it is likely that writer-reader contagion occurs for a variety of emotions and basic affective states beyond inspiration. To broaden the scope of our research, and to test whether the theorized mediator and moderator are distinctively applicable to inspiration per se, we also examine contagion of two covariates-awe and activated positive affect (PA)-that overlap substantially with inspiration but that represent alternative theoretical traditions. Whereas the inspiration construct emerged from the human motivation literature, the awe and PA constructs represent the discrete emotion and dimensional affect literatures, respectively (Thrash, Moldovan, Oleynick, et al., 2014).

Awe is an emotion that arises from the challenge of accommodating vast stimuli (Keltner & Haidt, 2003; Shiota, Keltner, & Mossman, 2007). Romantic expression theories provide grounds for positing contagion of awe and emotions more generally (Collingwood, 1938; Tolstoy, 1897/2014; for related theory and research, see Oatley, 2003; Robinson, 2005). We hypothesized that contagion of awe is mediated not by insightfulness, which implies ease of accommodation, but by sublimity-a grand, powerful, exalting quality of a stimulus that overwhelms one's capacity for rational comprehension (Longinus, 1890). The sublime has long been identified as the natural object of awe and related emotions (e.g., astonishment, revence; Burke, 1759; Kant, 1764/1960; Konečni, 2008; Longinus, 1890). Moreover, the concept of the sublime was originally applied to written language (Longinus, 1890), which is arguably its most potent elicitor (Burke, 1759). On the basis of past findings (Shiota, Keltner, & John, 2006; see also recent research by Silvia, Fayn, Nusbaum, & Beaty, in press), we hypothesized that awe contagion, like inspiration contagion, is moderated by reader openness.

PA is a basic affective state involving positive valence and arousal (Watson, Wiese, Vaidya, & Tellegen, 1999). The possibility of writer-reader contagion of PA is suggested by evidence that affect-laden language spreads across social networks (Kramer, Guillory, & Hancock, 2014). We hypothesized that PA contagion is mediated by the pleasantness of the text and moderated by reader approach temperament, a sensitivity to positive incentives (Elliot & Thrash, 2010). For thoroughness, we also test parallel hypotheses regarding negative affect (NA), low pleasantness (unpleasantness), and avoidance temperament (Elliot & Thrash, 2010). Although most relevant to PA and NA, pleasantness was also expected to contribute to contagion of inspiration and awe, given the positive valence of these states.

## Other Relations Between Writer and Reader States

Moving beyond contagion, we also investigate alternative consequences of writer inspiration and alternative antecedents of reader inspiration. Regarding the former, we hypothesized that writer inspiration predicts two indicators of reader enthrallment: awe and chills (Konečni, 2008; Maruskin, Thrash, & Elliot, 2012; Silvia & Nusbaum, 2011). We conceptualize enthrallment states as involving deep emotional resonance, a focus on the evocative object, and (in contrast to inspiration) little immediate motivational impetus. Because inspiration in a writer is theorized to transmit some admirable qualities that do not lend themselves to further transmission-such as originality (Thrash, Maruskin, et al., 2010) and sublimity (Longinus, 1890)-it may enthrall as well as inspire. Indeed, Bowra (1951) and Lembke (1973) have previously argued that inspired writing evokes both inspiration and chills.

Regarding alternative antecedents of reader inspiration, we test Valéry's hypothesis that reader inspiration is primarily a result of writer effort rather than writer inspiration. Although writer effort is likely to contribute to the production of inspiring texts, we are skeptical of reactionary, post-Romantic theorizing in which effort rather than inspiration is held to be the process through which inspiring texts are produced. Indeed, Thrash, Maruskin, et al. (2010) found that inspiration and effort during the writing of fictional stories were related to the total number of words typed and deleted, respectively. This finding suggests that inspiration and effort play complementary roles in the writing process. Inspiration may also provide motivational support for effort exertion (Thrash, Moldovan, Oleynick, et al., 2014), a possibility that Valéry acknowledged in his more nuanced writings (Valéry, 2007).

## Method

In the following, we present methods concerning both the writer and reader data collections. Methods and data concerning writer states and evaluative coding of poems, as well as data concerning the relations between writer states and evaluative coding, have been published previously (Study 3 of Thrash, Maruskin, et al., 2010). Methods and data concerning reader states, reader traits, and appraisal coding of the poems, as well as their relations to writer states and evaluative coding, have not been published previously.

## Participants

Writer sample. The writer sample consisted of 195 undergraduates (96 male, 99 female) who participated in return for credit toward a research participation requirement in an introductory psychology course. Ethnicity was distributed as follows: African American, 9.2%; Asian, 4.6%; Caucasian, 80.0%; Hispanic, 2.6%; Native American, .5%; Other, 3.1%. One additional participant had begun the study but quit prior to beginning the writing process questionnaire because his or her English was too poor to understand it.

Reader sample. The reader sample consisted of 220 undergraduates (66 male, 154 female) who participated in return for credit toward a research participation requirement in a course on personality and poetry. As an additional incentive, participants were offered feedback about their scores upon completion of the study. Ethnicity was distributed as follows: African American, 7.7%; Asian, 10.0%; Caucasian, 69.1%; Hispanic, 6.4%; Native American, .5%; Other, 6.4%. Seven additional participants had begun the study but failed to complete the personality questionnaire or failed to complete any poem questionnaires, and therefore data from these participants were dropped prior to analysis. The writer and reader samples attended the same competitive university, with a 5-year separation between data collections.

## Procedure

Writer sample. Participants in the writer sample attended individual lab sessions. Participants first completed a background questionnaire. They were then given 30 min to write a poem about the human condition using a word processor, with additional time granted upon request. Finally, participants completed a questionnaire regarding inspiration and other states during particular stages of the writing process.

Reader sample. Participants in the reader sample attended a preliminary orientation session and completed personality questionnaires near the beginning of the semester. Throughout the remainder of the semester, they were asked to complete a series of online poem questionnaires at times of their choosing in a private location. At the beginning of each poem questionnaire, a poem was presented, and participants then completed measures concerning their responses to the poem. Poems were presented in a different random order for each reader.

Following preliminary cleaning in which participant errors in entry of identifiers were reconciled, the poem questionnaire data file consisted of 41,397 cases. The data file was then cleaned by removing cases that met any of the following criteria: (a) no identifying information was provided; (b) the data came from an individual who had neither provided consent nor completed the personality questionnaires; (c) the participant responded affirmatively to a question asking if he or she would prefer to redo the questionnaire on a later occasion due to distraction or other factors that may invalidate the data; (d) the submission duplicated another submission; (e) time stamps revealed that the participant spent less than 2 min on the poem questionnaire (this cutoff was the nadir of a bimodal distribution); or (f) the data concerned a poem that had been included in error (this poem was written by the writing study participant whose English was too poor for him or her to fill out the writing process questionnaire). The final, cleaned data file consisted of 36,020 poem questionnaires. In this final data set, the number of poem questionnaires per reader ranged from one to 195 with a median of 193

### Measures

Writer states. Consistent with Thrash, Maruskin, et al. (2010), for a given writer state (e.g., inspiration), writers' reports regarding each of three conceptually distinct stages of the idea actualization process-the moment of getting the idea for a poem, the process of expressing the idea, and the process of revisingwere aggregated to yield an overall indicator of the state.

Writer inspiration was assessed using three of four items from the state version of the Inspiration Scale (Thrash & Elliot, 2003), adapted to each stage of the process. The full set of nine items, in order by stage, was as follows: ""I felt inspired at those moment(s),"" ""Something inspired me,"" and ""I was inspired to write""; ""I felt inspired while expressing my idea(s),"" ""Something inspired me,"" and ""I was inspired to write""; and ""I felt inspired while revising and finalizing this poem,"" ""Something inspired me,"" and ""I was inspired to revise this poem."" The fourth item from the Inspiration Scale was not administered regarding any stage. Response options ranged from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). An inspiration composite was formed by summing across the nine items (M = 37.57; SD = 11.60; a = . 91).

Writer awe was assessed using two items, ""full of awe"" and ""full of wonder,"" that were administered with respect to each stage of the writing process. Items were rated from 1 (very slightly or not at all) to 7 (extremely). An awe composite was formed by summing across the six items (M = 13.44; SD = 8.67; a = . 95).

Writer PA was assessed, separately for each stage, using four of five items (""excited,"" ""enthusiastic,"" ""alert,"" ""determined"") from a short version of the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PA-NAS; Kercher, 1992). The fifth item, ""inspired,"" was excluded in order to avoid redundancy between the PA and inspiration variables. Items were rated from 1 (very slightly or not at all) to 7 (extremely). A PA composite was formed by summing across the 12 items (M = 45.72; SD = 16.36; a = . 93).

Writer NA was assessed, separately for each stage, using five items (""upset,"" ""distressed,"" ""scared,"" ""nervous,"" ""afraid"") from a short version of the PANAS (Kercher, 1992). Items were rated from 1 (very slightly or not at all) to 7 (extremely). A NA composite was formed by summing across the 15 items (M = 25.25; SD = 12.75; α = . 93).

Writer effort was assessed with two items that were adapted to each stage of the writing process. The full set of six items, in order by stage, was as follows: ""I was working hard at those moment(s)"" and ""I was putting forth a great deal of effort at those moment(s)""; ""I worked hard in writing this poem"" and ""I put forth a great deal of effort into expressing my idea(s)""; and ""I worked hard on revising this poem"" and ""I put forth a great deal of effort into revising and finalizing this poem."" Response options ranged from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). An effort composite was formed by summing across the six items (M = 21.74; SD = 8.14; a = .89).

Reader states. Reader state measures were similar to those used for writer states but, of course, were administered once rather than once per stage of the writing process.

Reader inspiration was assessed using the full four-item state version of the Inspiration Scale. One item from the original state version of the scale (""Something I encountered or experienced inspired me"") was adapted to the poem-reading context (""Something about the poem inspired me""). Because reading may inspire actions other than writing (Thrash, Moldovan, Fuller, & Dombrowski, 2014), the scale was not adapted to focus specifically on inspiration to write. Items were rated from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very deeply or strongly). An inspiration composite was formed by summing across items (M = 7.65; SD = 5.69; a = . 98).

Reader awe was assessed using the two-item measure used for writer awe. Items were rated from 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely). An awe composite was formed by summing across items (M = 2.58; SD = 1.26; α = . 79).

Reader PA was assessed using the four-item measure used for writer PA. Items were rated from 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely). A PA composite was formed by summing across items (M = 6.26; SD = 2.52; α = . 70).

Reader NA was assessed using the five-item measure used for writer NA. Items were rated from 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely). A NA composite was formed by summing across items (M = 6.33; SD = 2.38; α = .83).

Reader chills was assessed using a preliminary version of the 12-item Chills Questionnaire (Maruskin et al., 2012). Items were as follows: ""got goosebumps,"" ""got a shiver down my spine,"" ""felt tickling sensations somewhere in my body,"" ""felt a chill pass through me,"" ""felt a tingling sensation spread over me,"" ""felt hairs stand-on-end somewhere on my body,"" ""got a cold sensation deep inside me,"" ""got a cool sensation on my skin,"" ""felt my muscles quiver or shiver,"" ""got pins-and-needles or prickling sensations,"" ""got a shudder or tremor,"" ""felt a wave of goosebumps come over me."" Items were rated on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 6 (ex tremely). A chills composite was formed by summing across items (M = 1.60; SD = 4.72; α = .91).2

Reader traits. Openness to experience was assessed using the 12-item scale from the NEO Five-Factor Inventory (Costa & McCrae, 1992). Items were rated from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). An openness composite was formed by summing across the 12 items (M = 43.57; SD = 6.82; a = . 79).

Approach and avoidance temperament were assessed using the six-item scales from the Approach-Avoidance Temperament Questionnaire (Elliot & Thrash, 2010). Items were rated from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Approach temperament and avoidance temperament composites were formed by summing across the respective sets of six items (approach temperament: M = 32.92; SD = 5.04; a = . 80; avoidance temperament: M = 24.45; SD = 7.49; α = .82).

Poem coding. In light of our integrative design, the poems function not only as products of writer states, but also as elicitors of reader states. Because the considerations involved in coding poems as products are different than those involved in coding poems as stimuli, we collected two sets of ratings and integrated them using factor analytic methods. We refer to the first coding task, which focused primarily on the quality of the poems as products, as evaluative coding, and the second, which focused primarily on psychologically meaningful stimulus qualities, as appraisal coding. In the following, we describe the two coding

<sup>2</sup> A subsequent version of this questionnaire was optimized for the separate assessment of distinct types of chills-in particular, goosetingles and coldshivers (Maruskin et al., 2012). We focus on overall chills in this study given that goosetingles and coldshivers are not clearly distinguished with the version of the Chills Questionnaire employed here.

tasks and then describe our method for integrating data obtained through the two methods.

Evaluative coding. Evaluative coding was performed by a panel of nine qualified coders, who were advanced English majors or graduate students of American literature. Coders rated the poems relative to one another (1 = very low, 5 = medium, 9 = very high) on each of the following dimensions (both the labels and descriptions were provided to coders): grammar/spelling (""the degree to which the poem has proper grammar and spelling""), punctuation/capitalization (""the degree to which the poem has proper punctuation and capitalization""), finish (""the degree to which the poem seems finished and polished, rather than unfinished and rough''), craftsmanship (""the degree to which the poem displays craftsmanship, using your own subjective definition of craftsmanship""), clarity (""the degree to which the ideas are expressed clearly""), sound/rhythm (""the degree to which word sound and rhythm are used effectively""), richness of imagery (""the degree to which vivid imagery is present""), beauty/aesthetic appeal (""the degree to which the poem is beautiful or aesthetically appealing""), pleasantness (""the degree to which the poem is pleasant, as opposed to unpleasant""), creativity (""the degree to which the poem is creative, using your own subjective definition of creativity""), novelty of style (""the degree to which the style of expression (e.g., word choice, literary devices, structure) is novel""), originality of idea (""the degree to which the thematic idea is original""), unusualness (""the degree to which the poem is unusual or out-ofthe-ordinary""), profundity (""the degree to which the poem is profound, showing depth and significance""), insightfulness (""the degree to which the poem transcends the obvious or superficial and discerns the true or hidden nature of things""), organic/authentic quality (""the degree to which the ideas and their expression are organic, natural, and authentic, as opposed to manufactured, contrived, and phony""), evocation of emotion (""the extent and depth of emotion that the poem evokes""), stimulation of thought (""the degree to which the poem stimulates thought or reflection""), and sublimity (""the degree to which the poem has a moving, exalting, or elevating effect""). The poems and variables to be coded were presented in different orders for each coder. Interrater reliability was established for all variables (see Table 1).

Appraisal coding. Appraisal coding was carried out by a panel of 11 undergraduate psychology research assistants. Whereas the evaluative coders had been selected on the basis of their qualifications for evaluating poetry, these coders were instead drawn from a population that resembles the population from which our readers were drawn. The following items were coded using an absolute scale (1 = strongly disagree, 4 = neutral, 7 = strongly agree): original or novel; beautiful or aesthetically appealing; revealing of truth; ordinary or mundane; morally good or right; emotionally impactful; profound or significant; creative; contrived or arbitrary; rational or logical; interesting; valuable or useful; meaningful; surprising; insightful; amusing; pleasant; superficial or cliché; complex; unifying or integrative; humorous; and unique. The poems and variables to be coded were presented in different orders for each coder. Interrater reliability was established for all variables (see Table 1). The items ""amusing"" and ""humorous"" were excluded from the primary analyses because they had low means and variances and converged poorly with other variables.

sets of ratings after method variance associated with coder group had been removed. Specifically, we adapted the correlated-traitscorrelated-methods (CTCM) multitrait-multimethod (MTMM) confirmatory factor analysis model, such that method factors (evaluative coding method, appraisal coding method) were represented with confirmatory factors as in a standard CTCM analysis, but substantive poem factors (""traits"") were modeled using exploratory factor analysis with geomin oblique rotation. A model with two confirmatory method factors and six exploratory substantive factors was found to have good fit, x-(741) = 1104.33, CFI = .95, TLI = .92, SRMR = .017, and readily interpretable factors. On the basis of factor loadings, we labeled the substantive factors as follows: mechanics, insightfulness, originality, clarity, emotionality, and pleasantness/sublimity. Factor loadings are shown in Table 1. Notably, conceptually similar variables from different coder groups loaded together as indicators of the same factors, indicating convergent validity. Correlations between factors ranged from r = -. 44 (originality and clarity) to .60 (mechanics and originality).

Because the insightfulness and originality factors were of direct theoretical interest, we saved factor scores for these factors for use in subsequent analysis (insightfulness: M = . 00, SD = 1.00; originality: M = . 00, SD = . 99).3 Because the pleasantness/ sublimity factor is also relevant but subsumes theoretically distinct pleasantness and sublimity constructs, we used ratings of pleasantness and sublimity from the evaluative coding as separate variables in subsequent analyses (pleasantness: M = 4.65, SD = 1.25; sublimity: M = 4.26; SD = 1.23).

## Variable Transformation and Rescaling

Variable distributions were examined using Q-Q plots. Because of strong positive skew, reader inspiration, PA, and NA were transformed using a log transformation. Because of severe positive skew, reader awe and chills were transformed using an inverse transformation. In supplemental analyses, we repeated our core analyses using outcome variables that were trichotomized and modeled as ordered categorical (ordinal). These analyses yielded findings generally comparable to those based on transformation (for details, see Footnote 10).

To facilitate model estimation, variables were rescaled as needed so that their variances fell in the 1-10 range (Muthén & Muthén, 2012). All predictor variables (i.e., writer states, poem characteristics, and reader traits) were centered in order to facilitate interpretation of moderation and moderated mediation analyses. Predictors were centered at the level at which they were measured.4

Factor analytic integration of evaluative and appraisal coding. We used exploratory structural equation modeling (Asparouhov & Muthén, 2009) to examine the factor structure of the two

<sup>3</sup> It was not possible to use ESEM factors in our subsequent crossclassified modeling analyses, because ESEM in Mplus currently requires maximum likelihood estimation, whereas cross-classified modeling requires Bayesian estimation.

<sup>4</sup> This study was conducted as part of a larger project. We have also conducted preliminary analyses for a separate publication that will address a distinct topic, with partial overlap of variables. Although we collected additional variables not reported here, our analyses were guided systematically by our comprehensive statistical framework, theory, and a priori decisions.

## Results

## Analytic Strategy

The labels Level 2A, Level 2B, and Level 1 (Muthén & Muthén, 2012) may be used to characterize the nesting structure of the data. Writers (and their associated poems) are the Level 2A units, which may be regarded as populating the left margin of the Writer X Reader matrix in Figure 1. Writer states and poem characteristics were assessed at this level (N = 195). Readers are the Level 2B units, which may be regarded as populating the top margin of the Writer × Reader matrix. Reader traits were assessed at this level (N = 220). Particular writer-reader pairings are the Level 1 units, which correspond to cells within the Writer × Reader matrix. Reader states were assessed at this level (N = 36,020). A given Level 1 unit is nested within a particular Level 2A unit and within a particular Level 2B unit and hence is cross-classified.

We adopt a second set of labels-Writer level, Reader level, and Writer × Reader level-to refer to three orthogonal levels of analysis at which a given variable may or may not have variance. If one applies the values of variables measured at Level 2A (e.g., writer inspiration) to the cells in their corresponding rows, the total variance in these variables across all 36,020 cells is due entirely to writer-level variance (i.e., differences between writers). Likewise, if one applies the values of variables measured at Level 2B (e.g., reader openness) to the cells in their corresponding columns, the total variance in these variables across all 36,020 cells is due entirely to reader-level variance (i.e., differences between readers). In contrast, the total variance in variables measured at Level 1 (e.g., reader inspiration) may span three levels of analysis. Reader inspiration, for instance, may vary at the Writer level (i.e., some writers' poems may tend to be more inspiring than others'), Reader level (i.e., some readers may tend to be more inspired than others), and a residual Writer × Reader level (i.e., reader inspiration may also depend on the particular writer-reader pairing).5

All analyses were conducted using Mplus 7.3 with Bayesian estimation (Asparouhov & Muthén, 2010; Muthén & Muthén, 2012). We used Bayesian estimation because cross-classified models are too computationally demanding for traditional estimation methods, and because it allows rigorous testing of the significance of indirect effects and other derived parameters (Muthén & Asparouhov, 2012; Yuan & MacKinnon, 2009). We used uninformative priors, rather than informative priors based on theory or past findings. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm based on the Gibbs sampler was used to generate the posterior distribution for each parameter. Two MCMC chains were used, and the second half of each chain was retained. Potential scale reduction (PSR) was used as the MCMC convergence criterion. To minimize the possibility of premature convergence, analyses were repeated with the minimum number of iterations set at four times the number of iterations from the initial analysis (Muthén & Asparouhov, 2012). All reported point estimates are medians of posterior distributions. Bayesian 95% credible intervals (CIs) are used for all significance tests and are presented in brackets. References to marginal significance indicate that zero fell within the 95% CI but not within the 90% CI. Where reported, p values are one-tailed and indicate the proportion of the posterior distribution that is below zero in the case of positive estimates or above zero in the case of negative estimates.

In our primary analyses, we examined each writer/reader state (e.g., inspiration, awe) in separate models, without controlling other states. In ancillary analyses reported at the end of the Results section, we also examined the incremental predictive utility of each writer state with other writer states controlled. Reasons for not controlling other states in our primary analyses are as follows. First, retaining the full variance in each construct allows us to draw conclusions about contagion of each construct per se. Second, detecting contagion of the unique portions of each of a set of constructs chosen on the basis of maximal redundancy would be unrealistic without extraordinarily large samples. Indeed, detecting contagion of the unpartialed states may itself be difficult, because contagion effects are inherently indirect (i.e., the text intervenes between writer and reader) and therefore are likely to be modest in magnitude. Third, controlling other writer states may or may not be considered desirable, depending on one's assumptions about the pattern of causal relations among writer states. Controlling a third variable is desirable if the third variable is a common cause but undesirable if it is a mediator. Notably, these difficulties are less relevant to the issues of multiple mediators and multiple moderators than to the issue of multiple writer and reader states. Accordingly, unique mediation and moderation effects were examined by modeling all mediators or all moderators simultaneously.

### Variance Decomposition of Reader States

For each reader state, cross-classified intraclass correlations (ICCs; Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002) are presented in Table 2. These ICCs indicate the proportions of total variance found at the writer, reader, and Writer × Reader levels of analysis. For reader inspiration, the percentages of the variance each level were as follows: Writer level, 5.7%; Reader level, 42.8%, and Writer × Reader level, 51.5%. These values reveal, respectively, a tendency for some poems to be generally more inspiring than others; a stronger tendency for some readers to be generally more inspired than

others; and a particularly strong tendency for reader inspiration to hinge on the pairing of a particular reader with a particular poem. Although the presence of writer-level variance in reader inspiration is consistent with the hypothesis that writers' inspiration tends to be infectious (as tested in the following analysis of contagion), the larger proportions of variance at the reader and Writer × Reader levels suggest that reader personality may play an important role as predictor of reader inspiration and moderator of contagion (as tested in the subsequent moderation analysis). As shown in Table 2, variance decompositions for reader awe, PA, NA, and chills were similar to that for reader inspiration.

## Contagion Effects

For descriptive purposes, correlations among writer states, poem characteristics, and the writer-level components of reader states were estimated using a random-intercepts model and are reported in Table 3.

Contagion hypotheses were formally tested by estimating unstandardized effects in random-slope-and-intercept models. In each analysis, a given reader state (e.g., inspiration) was regressed on the corresponding writer state, with the intercept free to vary at all levels and the slope free to vary across readers. Each reader's slope reflects the effect of the writer state (left column of Figure 1) on his or her own state (a particular column of the Writer × Reader matrix).

The fixed effect of a given writer state refers to the mean slope across readers. Fixed effects are shown in Table 4. Regarding inspiration contagion, the fixed effect was positive as hypothesized, although the 95% CI narrowly included zero (p = . 053). Although the 95% CI included zero in this model, it excluded zero in all subsequent models (mediation, moderation, and moderated mediation). Taken together, these findings call for rejection of the null hypothesis for inspiration contagion.6 We conclude that the inspiration of the average reader is predictable from the inspiration of the unseen writer ""behind"" the text. Similarly, significant positive fixed effects were documented for awe, PA, and NA. Thus, contagion generalizes across a set of motivation, discrete emotion, and dimensional affect constructs.

Although the unstandardized coefficients in Table 4 cannot be directly compared with one another, the correlations reported in Table 3 are useful for gauging the relative magnitudes of the contagion effects (inspiration, r = . 13; awe, r = . 23; PA, r = . 15; NA, r = . 20). Contagion of inspiration was weaker (but not significantly so) than contagion of the other states (inspiration vs.

<sup>5</sup> With one observation per cell by design, between-cell Writer × Reader variance cannot be distinguished from within-cell variance (Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002). We use the label ""Writer X Reader level"" because our focus is on predicting reliable between-cell variance. In a design with multiple observations per cell, such that each reader responds to each writer's poem more than once, the Writer × Reader and within-cell levels could be decomposed, resulting in four distinct levels of analysis.

<sup>6</sup> Whereas the proportion of the posterior distribution below zero for the contagion effect was p = . 053 in the present model, it was p = . 003 in the mediation model, p = . 020 in the moderation model, and n = .006 in the moderated mediation model. On average across models, the proportion of the posterior distribution below zero was p = . 021, warranting rejection of the null hypothesis. Slight differences in estimates and CIs across models are not surprising given that the models varied with respect to whether mediators and/or moderators were included.

The random effect of a given writer state refers to variability in the writer-reader slope across readers, capturing individual differences in readers' receptivity to contagion. Random effects are shown in Table 4. Next we report mediation and moderation analyses, which account for the fixed and random aspects of contagion, respectively.

#### Mediation by Poem Characteristics

Four poem characteristics-insightfulness, pleasantness, originality, and sublimity-were selected as candidate mediators on the basis of theory (see Introduction) and factor analysis (see Method). We examined contagion of each writer/reader state in separate models, with all four mediators modeled simultaneously. To test mediation, we used a Bayesian cross-classified extension of multilevel structural equation modeling (Preacher, Zyphur, & Zhang, 2010; Yuan & MacKinnon, 2009). Because the writer state and poem characteristics cannot vary across readers, the paths (slopes) from the writer state to poem characteristics were modeled as fixed. Because the effects of poem characteristics and the direct effect of the writer state on the reader state may vary across readers, these paths were modeled as having both fixed and random components. For a particular writer/reader state, the indirect effect via a given poem characteristic was computed as the product of (a) the effect of the writer state on the poem characteristic, and (b) the average effect of the poem characteristic on the reader state. 7 Fixed effects from the mediation models are shown in Table 5. All effects discussed in this section concern average effects across readers.

As shown in Table 5 and Figure 2A, writer inspiration positively predicted insightfulness, pleasantness, originality, and sublimity. Insightfulness and pleasantness, in turn, positively predicted reader inspiration, whereas originality negatively predicted reader inspiration. Accordingly, writer inspiration had positive indirect effects on reader inspiration via insightfulness, B = . 021 [.015, .026], and pleasantness, B = . 034 [.024, . 046], and a negative indirect effect via originality, B = -. 029 [-. 038, -. 020].8 These findings demonstrate that inspiration is infectious due to the insightfulness and not the originality of inspired writing; indeed, the originality of inspired writing suppressed contagion. The indirect effect via pleasantness is consistent with the positive valence of inspiration.

Documentation of three highly significant indirect effects is noteworthy given the modest (r = . 13) and narrowly significant overall fixed contagion effect documented above (see Table 4 and Footnote 6). This apparent contradiction may be explained as an

instance of inconsistent mediation (MacKinnon, Krull, & Lockwood, 2000). The overall contagion effect was only modestly greater than zero not because writer inspiration had little effect, but rather because it had multiple effects that varied in sign and therefore suppressed one another. The modest net effect of writer inspiration belies its explanatory power, as becomes apparent from the moderated mediation analysis below, in which the negative indirect effect via originality is essentially switched on and off by a moderating variable.

Writer awe had positive indirect effects on reader awe via sublimity, B = . 013 [.006, . 020], and pleasantness, B = . 018 [.010, .026]. Writer awe also had a negative indirect effect via originality, B = -. 002 [-. 003, -. 000], such that writer awe led to higher levels of originality, which, in turn, led to lower levels of reader awe. These awe findings parallel the inspiration findings except that a double dissociation was documented: insightfulness mediated contagion of inspiration but not awe, whereas sublimity mediated contagion of awe but not inspiration.

Writer PA had positive indirect effects on reader PA via pleasantness, B = . 022 [.010, .034], and insightfulness, B = . 003 [.001, .005]. Given the similarity of the inspiration and PA findings, we conducted an additional pair of analyses in which the effect of the other writer state was controlled. In the analysis of inspiration contagion, all three indirect effects remained significant when writer PA was controlled. In the analysis of PA contagion, the indirect effect via pleasantness remained significant. The indirect effect via insightfulness was again significant but reversed in sign, due to a negative unique effect of writer PA on insightfulness.

<sup>7</sup> Extending Preacher et al.'s (2010) notation to the case of cross-classified models, our mediational model could be described as a 2A -> 2A -> 1 mediation model. Whereas Preacher et al.'s (2010) two-level 2 -> 2 -> 1 model necessarily involves fixed slopes for both the a and b paths, the cross-classified context allows for the possibility that the b path varies at level 2B (i.e., across readers). Accordingly, we estimated the indirect effect as a × b as in Preacher et al.'s 2 -> 2 -> 1 model, except that b was estimated as the average of readers' randomly varying slopes, rather than as a nonvarying fixed slope. Given that our b path may vary randomly, our model also resembles Preacher et al.'s 2 -> 1 -> 1 model, which allows for the possibility of varying b paths. However, because our mediator exists at Level 2A rather than Level 1, the complication of between- and withinlevel confounding of the b slope does not arise in our case.

<sup>8</sup> Unless otherwise indicated, positive indirect effects discussed in the text are products of positive a and b paths. That is, higher levels of the writer and reader state are related to higher levels of the mediator. In instances where a positive indirect effect is the product of negative a and b paths, we indicate that the effect is mediated by low levels of the mediator.

Table 3 Correlations at the Writer Level of Analysis

Note. These correlations are based on covariances at the Writer level of analysis and are standardized with respect to model essimates of write-level variances. For effects in bold, 95% CIs exclude zero.

Thus, insightfulness was distinctively implicated in contagion of inspiration.

Writer NA had positive indirect effects on reader NA via insightfulness, B = . 002 [.001, . 004] and low pleasantness, B = . 054 [.043, .066]. Writer NA also had a negative indirect effect via sublimity, B = -. 009 [-. 014, -. 005], such that writer NA led to lower sublimity, and lower sublimity, in turn, led to lower reader NA.

These findings support our hypotheses that inspiration and awe contagion are mediated by insightfulness and sublimity, respectively. Pleasantness, a fundamental stimulus dimension, mediated contagion of PA and contributed to contagion of all other states we examined.

## Moderation by Reader Personality

Having documented contagion and mediation for the average reader, we next tested whether contagion effects vary as a function of reader personality. We tested each writer/reader state in a separate model, with all candidate moderators (openness, approach temperament, and avoidance temperament) modeled simultaneously. Moderation was tested by modeling reader traits as predictors of random writer-reader slopes (as in hierarchical multilevel modeling) rather than by modeling product terms (as in multiple regression).9 Fixed effects are reported in Table 6.

First we consider direct effects of reader traits on reader states. As shown in Table 6, approach temperament positively predicted

reader inspiration, awe, and PA, whereas avoidance temperament positively predicted NA.

Next we consider moderating effects of reader traits. In the inspiration analysis, contagion was moderated by openness, B = .005 [.001, .010], such that contagion was stronger for readers higher in openness. We also examined conditional effects-that is, contagion effects at particular levels of the moderator. In this and subsequent analyses, low, moderate, and high levels of the moderator refer to the observed minimum, mean, and maximum, respectively.10 The conditional effect of writer inspiration on reader inspiration was significantly greater than zero for readers moderate, B = . 036 [.001, .073], or high, B = . 062 [.022, . 105], but not low, B = . 002 [- . 042, . 046], in openness. Figure 3 illustrates the conditional effect and 95% CI band at all levels of reader openness. In this plot, the moderation effect corresponds to the positive slope of the conditional effect line, and conditional contagion effects are significant at levels of reader openness where the CI band excludes zero. This moderation analysis reveals an additional reason (in addition to suppression by originality) that the average contagion effect was modest in magnitude: contagion effects were present for readers at or above the mean in openness, but not for those below the mean.

The hypothesis that awe contagion is moderated by reader openness was not supported, B = . 002 [- . 004, . 008]. Contagion of awe was instead moderated by reader approach temperament, ß = .007 [.002, .013], such that contagion was stronger for readers higher in approach temperament. The conditional effect of writer

<sup>9</sup> In all moderation and moderated mediation analyses, main effects of reader traits were modeled with random intercepts but fixed slopes, be cause preliminary models that included random slopes for reader traits (in addition to random intercepts and slopes for all writer-level predictors) were excessively slow to converge or could not be estimated successfully.

<sup>10</sup> The minimum, mean, and maximum of the moderator correspond to the leftmost portion of the X axis, the 0 point, and the rightmost portion of the X axis, in all moderation and moderated mediation figures. We caution that our conditional effect analyses describe conditional effects across the full range of the moderator, and therefore ""low"" and ""high"" levels of the moderator are more extreme in the present context than they are when standardized scores of -1 and 1 are used.

Contagion of PA was likewise moderated by approach temperament, ß = . 006 [.003, .010], such that contagion was stronger for readers higher in approach temperament. The conditional effect of writer PA on reader PA was significantly greater than zero for readers moderate, B = .026 [.001, .051], or high, B = .054 [.024, .083], but not low, B = - . 036 [-. 079, .008], in approach temperament (see Figure 5).

Contagion of NA was moderated (marginally) by avoidance temperament, ß = . 004 [-. 000, . 009] (p = . 036), such that contagion was stronger for readers higher in avoidance temperament. The conditional effect of writer NA on reader NA was significantly greater than zero for readers low, B = . 059 [.018, .108], moderate, B = . 082 [.054, . 127], and high, B = . 105 [.065, .159], in avoidance temperament (see Figure 6A). Contagion of NA was also moderated by approach temperament, ß = . 007 [.003, .012], such that contagion was stronger for readers higher in approach temperament. The conditional effect of writer NA on reader NA was significantly greater than zero for readers moderate, B = .082 [.054, .127], or high, B = . 115 [.080, .171], but not low, B = . 010 [-. 046, . 064], in approach temperament (see Figure (B).

These findings reveal a double dissociation in the moderation of contagion of inspiration and its covariates. Openness to experience moderated contagion of inspiration but not of awe or PA; conversely, approach temperament moderated contagion of awe and PA but not of inspiration. Contagion of NA was moderated by approach and avoidance temperaments.

### Moderated Mediation

The above mediation analyses documented the characteristics of inspired writing through which, for the average reader, inspiration contagion was facilitated (insightfulness, pleasantness) or sup-

pressed (originality). The moderation analyses documented for whom inspiration contagion effects were stronger versus weaker than average (readers higher vs. lower in openness). Considered together, these answers to questions of ""how?"" and ""for whom?"" raise a further question: Is the greater proneness of open readers to inspiration contagion a result of drawing more inspiration from particular characteristics of inspired writing? To answer this question, we specified a model that integrated the above mediation and moderation models. Reader traits were specified to moderate the random effects of the mediators on reader inspiration, as well as the random direct effect of writer inspiration on reader inspiration.

Much as moderation may be indexed as the effect (e.g., the slope in Figures 3-6) of a moderator on the conditional effect of a writer state on a reader state, moderated mediation may be indexed as the effect (slope) of a moderator on the conditional indirect effect via a particular mediator. In the present context, in which the second but not the first path of an indirect effect is potentially moderated, this index is computed as the product of (a) the effect of the writer state on a given mediator, and (b) the effect of the moderator on the slope relating the mediator to the reader state (Hayes, 2015; for a generalization, see Wang & Preacher, 2015). Fixed effects, including indexes of moderated mediation, are shown in Table 7.

As indicated in Table 7, reader openness and approach temperament were both documented as moderators of indirect effects. In the following, we first present openness findings, followed by approach temperament findings.

Openness as a moderator of indirect effects. Reader openness was found to moderate the indirect effect of writer inspiration on reader inspiration via originality, B = . 003 [.001, .005], such that the indirect effect was less negative for readers higher in openness. The conditional indirect effect via originality was significantly less than zero for readers low, B = - -. 046 [-. 062, -. 032], moderate, B = - . 028 [-. 036, -. 020], and high, B = - . 013 [-. 027, - . 000], in openness, although it approached nonsignificance at the highest levels of openness. The moderated mediation effect corresponds to the positive slope of the condi-

tional indirect effect line plotted in Figure 7C. Because reader traits cannot impact the effect of writer inspiration on poem characteristics, moderation of the indirect effect via originality is attributable to moderation of the effect of originality on reader inspiration (see Table 7).

Reader openness was also found to moderate (marginally) the indirect effect via sublimity, B = . 003 [- . 000, .006] (p = . 030), such that the indirect effect was initially less negative and then more positive with increasing levels of openness. The conditional indirect effect via sublimity was negative and marginally significant for readers low in openness, B = - . 020 [-. 044, . 003] (p = . 048), close to zero and nonsignificant for readers moderate in openness, B = -. 002 [-.. 018, .013], and positive but nonsignificant for readers high in openness B = . 012 [- . 010, . 034]. The moderated mediation effect corresponds to the positive slope of the conditional indirect effect line plotted in Figure 7D. (Marginal) moderation of the indirect effect via sublimity is attributable to (marginal) moderation of the effect of sublimity on reader inspiration (see Table 7).

Openness was found not to moderate indirect effects via insightfulness or pleasantness. As illustrated in Figures 7A and 7B, conditional indirect effects via insightfulness and pleasantness were uniformly positive and significant across levels of openness. The lack of moderation of the indirect effects via insightfulness and pleasantness is manifest as horizontal slopes in these plots.

These moderated mediation findings explain why openness moderated contagion of inspiration. At all levels of openness, individuals showed a proneness to contagion via the insightfulness and pleasantness of inspired writing. These effects were offset (suppressed) by a negative indirect effect via originality to a greater degree among individuals lower in openness. In addition, the sublimity of inspired writing showed a tendency to suppress contagion at low levels of openness and a tendency to facilitate contagion at high levels of openness. We conclude that open readers were not more responsive to the positively inspiring aspects of inspired writing (insightfulness, pleasantness); rather, they were more tolerant of the incidental characteristics of inspired writing (originality, sublimity) that undermined contagion in readers low in openness.

Approach temperament as a moderator of indirect effects. Reader approach temperament was found to moderate the indirect contagion effect via pleasantness, B = . 004 [.002, . 007], such that the indirect effect was more positive for readers higher in approach temperament. The conditional indirect effect via pleasantness was significantly greater than zero for readers moderate, B = . 034 [.023, .047], or high, B = . 054 [.038, . 070], but not low, B = - . 008 [ - . 034, .018], in approach temperament. This moderated mediation effect is manifest as a positive slope in Figure 8B. Moderation of the indirect effect via pleasantness is attributable to moderation of the effect of pleasantness on reader inspiration (see Table 7).

Reader approach temperament was also found to moderate the indirect effect via originality, B = -. 003 [-. 005, -. 001], such that the indirect effect was more negative for readers higher in approach temperament. The conditional indirect effect via originality was significantly less than zero for readers moderate, B = -. 028 [-. 036, -. 020], or high, B = -. 043 [-. 055, -. 031], but not low, B = . 005 [-. 016, . 024], in approach temperament. This moderated mediation effect is manifest as a negative slope in Figure 8C. Moderation of the indirect effect via originality is attributable to moderation of the effect of originality on reader inspiration (see Table 7).

Note. For effects in bold, 95% Cls exclude zero. Arrows pointing to effects within parentheses indicate moderation of those effects.

Approach temperament did not moderate indirect effects via insightfulness or sublimity. As illustrated in Figure 8A and 8D, the conditional indirect effect via insightfulness was uniformly positive and significant across levels of reader openness, and the conditional indirect effect via sublimity was uniformly nonsignificant. The lack of moderation of the indirect effects via insightfulness and sublimity is manifest as roughly horizontal slopes in these plots.

Moderation of mediation by approach temperament may seem surprising given that approach temperament had not emerged as a moderator of inspiration contagion (see Table 6). These findings may be reconciled as a case of a novel statistical phenomenon that we label (by analogy to inconsistent mediation) inconsistent moderation of mediation, in which a null or weak moderation effect belies the existence of multiple moderated mediation effects that vary in sign and therefore offset one another. In this case, the failure of approach temperament to significantly moderate inspiration contagion belies the fact that individuals higher in approach

temperament were both more prone to contagion via the pleasantness of inspired writing and less prone to contagion via the originality of inspired writing.

# Alternative Consequences of Writer Inspiration and Antecedents of Reader Inspiration

Next we consider alternative consequences of writer inspiration and alternative antecedents of reader inspiration. We conducted a series of analyses in which one of five writer states (including effort) was modeled as a predictor of one of five reader states (including chills). Mediators were modeled in all analyses in order to facilitate interpretation. Total effects of each writer state on each reader state are reported in the top of Table 8. In the following, we focus on results relevant to the issues of reader enthrallment and the perspiration narrative.

Writer inspiration as an antecedent of reader enthrallment. As shown in the top of Table 8, writer inspiration positively

Figure 5. Moderation of PA contagion by reader approach temperament. The straight line indicates the conditional effect of writer PA on reader PA at particular levels of reader approach temperament. The arcs demarcate the 95% CI band.

predicted both indicators of reader enthrallment, awe and chills. In fact, as shown in Table 3, writer inspiration predicted reader awe (r = .30) and chills (r = .24) more strongly than reader inspiration (r = . 13), although only the contrast with reader awe was significant (prediction of reader inspiration vs. awe, raif = . 168 [.052, .290]; prediction of reader inspiration vs. chills, raif = . 103 [-. 063, . 272].

Indirect effects of writer inspiration on reader awe and chills are illustrated in Figure 2B-C. In the prediction of reader awe, writer inspiration had positive indirect effects via insightfulness, B = .006 [.001, .010], pleasantness, B = . 023 [.014, . 031], and sublimity, B = . 022 [.008, .033], and a negative indirect effect via originality, B = -. 009 [-. 015, -. 002]. In the prediction of reader chills, writer inspiration had positive indirect effects via insightfulness, B = . 015 [.011, . 020], and sublimity, B = . 039 [.027, .054], and negative indirect effects via pleasantness B = -. 016 [-. 025, -. 008], and originality, B = -. 009 [-. 017, -. 003]. As revealed in Tables 3 and 8, writer inspiration had relatively strong and highly significant total effects on reader enthrallment in spite of suppression from negative indirect effects.

Notably, sublimity was a pivotal mediator that distinguished the enthralling effects of writer inspiration from its inspiring effects. Writer inspiration predicted sublimity, which, in turn, predicted reader awe and chills but not reader inspiration. Sublime stimuli are natural elicitors of awe and chills, but they elude the grasp of understanding and hence do not instigate an inspired epistemic transmission process in the average reader.

Writer effort as an antecedent of reader inspiration. As shown in the top of Table 8, writer effort positively predicted reader inspiration, consistent with the perspiration narrative. Indirect effects are shown in Figure 2D. Writer effort had positive indirect effects via insightfulness, B = . 007 [.005, . . 010], pleasantness, B = . 015 [.010, . 020], and low originality, B = . 003 [.002, .005].

Although writer effort predicted reader inspiration, so too did all other writer states that we examined. This finding raises the question of whether effort contributes uniquely to the prediction of reader inspiration. We address this question and other questions of incremental predictive utility in the following section. We also note that writer effort was the only writer variable that failed to predict any reader states beyond reader inspiration.

# Ancillary Analyses: Incremental Predictive Utility of Writer States

Finally, we conducted a set of ancillary analyses in which all five writer states were modeled as simultaneous predictors of a given reader state, again with mediators modeled in order to facilitate interpretation. Total effects from these analyses are shown in the bottom of Table 8. We emphasize that these analyses are stringent and are not necessarily more ""correct"" than the analyses reported above. As discussed above, the desirability of controlling other writer states depends on assumptions about the pattern of causal relations among writer states, assumptions that cannot be tested with the present design.

Robustness of writer-reader contagion effects. As shown in the bottom of Table 8, the inspiration contagion total effect became nonsignificant when other writer states were controlled. However, all three indirect effects of writer inspiration on reader inspiration remained significant: insightfulness, B = . 027 [.020, .035], pleasantness, B = . 005 [.003, . 008], and originality, B = - . 033 [-. 043, -. 022]. Controlling other writer states weakened the positive indirect effect via pleasantness, thus explaining why the total (net) effect was reduced to zero.

The awe contagion total effect also became nonsignificant when other writer states were controlled. The indirect effect via pleasantness remained significant, B = . 004 [.002, .007]. The negative indirect effect via originality became positive, B = . 004 [.001, .006], due to a negative rather than positive unique effect of writer awe on originality. In addition, there was now a negative indirect effect via insightfulness, B = -. 003 [-. 006, -. 001], such that writer awe uniquely predicted lower insightfulness, and lower insightfulness, in turn, predicted lower reader awe. Most noteworthy, the positive indirect effect via sublimity became nonsignificant, B = . 000 [-. 001, . 000].

The PA contagion total effect also became nonsignificant. The indirect effect via pleasantness remained significant, B = . 017 [.006, .027], whereas the indirect effect via insightfulness became nonsignificant, B = . 000 [-. 001, . 000].

The NA contagion total effect remained significant when other writer states were controlled. All three indirect effects documented above remained significant: pleasantness, B = . 045 [.035, . 056], insightfulness, B = . 003 [.001, .006], and sublimity, B = - . 007 [-. 011, -. 004]. In addition, there was now a positive indirect effect via originality, B = . 001 [.000, . 002].

In sum, in these stringent ancillary analyses in which other writer states were controlled, contagion effects became nonsignificant for inspiration, awe, and PA, whereas the NA contagion effect remained significant. This pattern of findings is understandable in light of the considerable overlap among writer inspiration, awe, and PA (rs = . 44 to .70; see Table 3) and the negligible overlap between these variables and writer NA (rs = - . 09 to . 10). The hypothesized indirect effects

were robust for contagion of inspiration, PA, and NA, but not awe (i.e., the indirect effect via sublimity became nonsignificant).

Robustness of the enthralling effects of inspiration. Next we examined the robustness of the enthralling effects of inspiration when other writer states are controlled. The total effect of writer inspiration on reader awe remained significant (see the bottom of Table 8), as did all four indirect effects: insightfulness, B = . 008 [.002, . 014], pleasantness, B = . 004 [.002, . 006], originality, B = -. 011 [-. 019, -. 003], and sublimity, B = . 016 [.007, . 025]. Likewise, the total effect of writer inspiration on reader chills remained significant, as did all four indirect effects: insightfulness, B = . 019 [.013, . 025], pleasantness, B = - . 002 [-. 004, -. 001], originality, B = -. 012 [-. 020, -. 003], and sublimity, B = . 027 [.017, .037]. Thus, the enthralling effects of writer inspiration were robust when other writer states are controlled.

Robustness of the effect of writer effort on reader inspiration. Finally, we examined the robustness of the effect of writer effort on reader inspiration. The total effect of writer effort was no longer significant when other writer states were controlled (see the bottom of Table 8). Of the three indirect effects documented above, only the positive indirect effect via low originality remained significant, B = . 014 [.009, .018]. These findings raise further doubts about the centrality of effortful processes in the generation of deeply affecting texts.11

# Discussion

Contagion of inspiration via the written word is, by most measures, one of the ""big"" ideas of Western scholarship-it has a long and rich history in the humanities, it concerns peaks of human experience, it has far-reaching implications for the transmission of culture, and it is broadly relevant across the aesthetic, spiritual, and intellectual domains. Nevertheless, the concept of inspiration contagion has been conspicuously absent from the contemporary research literature. In the following, we summarize the results of our investigation and discuss their implications and limitations.

## Writer-Reader Inspiration Contagion

Our core finding is that student writers' privately reported inspiration predicts the privately reported inspiration of the average student reader, despite lack of contact between writers and readers beyond the intervening text. This finding attests to the power of the written word as a vehicle for sharing the peaks of human experience among individuals separated in time or place. As Bowra (1951) suggested, the inspired poem ""creates in us the kind of exaltation which the poet himself has known in his times of vision and enraptured creation . . . the central, final, inescapable fact is that inspired words create life in us because they are themselves alive"" (p. 36).

#### Mediation of Inspiration Contagion

Such descriptions of a text as alive or inspired vividly convey the transitivity of inspired writing; they imply a vital inspiration process through which the words were produced and a homologous process through which they are received. However, we have not formally conceptualized texts as inspired, because states of inspiration properly belong to individuals.12 Conceptualizing a text as inspired is, at best, redundant with conceptualizing writers or readers as inspired and, at worst, prone to the kinds of inferential ambiguities and circularity of reasoning that have led some theorists to be needlessly suspicious of the inspiration concept (e.g., Fehrman, 1980; Valéry, 1958; Wimsatt & Beardsley, 1946). Instead, we have conceptualized texts as displaying specific observable characteristics (e.g., insightfulness), as evaluated by independent judges. From this perspective, the transitivity of inspired writing may be operationalized as positive indirect effects via qualities of the text.

Our mediation findings may be summarized as follows: Writer inspiration had positive effects on poem insightfulness, pleasantness, originality, and sublimity. In turn, insightfulness and pleasantness had positive effects on the inspiration of the average reader, whereas originality had a negative effect and sublimity had a null effect. Accordingly, writer inspiration had positive indirect effects on the inspiration of the average reader via insightfulness and pleasantness and a negative indirect effect via originality.

The positive indirect effects via insightfulness and pleasantness support our theorizing. In particular, the indirect effect via insightfulness is consistent with the theorized epistemic transmission function of inspiration operating in the writer and reader. That is, an insightful text functions both as the concretization of the writer's inspiration and as the elicitor of a comparable state in the reader. In addition, the indirect effect via pleasantness is consistent

<sup>11</sup> As noted, given that the dependent variables were highly skewed, we repeated our core analyses using outcomes that were trichotomized and modeled as ordered categorical (rather than transformed and modeled as continuous, as in our primary analyses). These supplemental analyses have the advantage of not violating distributional assumptions, but they have the disadvantage of loss of variance. These supplemental analyses yielded findings generally comparable to our primary findings. A summary of the findings based on ordered categorical outcomes is as follows: (a) In the inspiration contagion analysis (see Table 4), the nonsignificant fixed effect of writer inspiration became marginally significant (B = . 026 [-. 005. .055], p = . 050). (b) Regarding mediation of inspiration contagion (see Table 5), all indirect effect findings remained the same. (c) Regarding moderation of inspiration contagion (see Table 6), the significant moderating effect of openness became marginally significant (B = . 006 [-. 001, .013], p = . 038). (d) Regarding moderated mediation (see Table 7), findings for indexes of moderated mediation remained the same, except that avoidance temperament emerged as a significant moderator of the indirect effect via sublimity (B = . 003 [.000, . 005]). (e) Regarding alternative antecedents and consequences (see top of Table 8), findings related to total and indirect effects of writer inspiration on reader awe and chills remained the same, except that the significant indirect effect of writer inspiration on reader awe via originality became marginally significant. (B = -. 006 [-. 012, . 000], p = . 035). Findings related to the total and indirect effects of writer effort on reader inspiration remained the same. (f) Regarding tests of incremental predictive utility (see bottom of Table 8). total and indirect effects of writer inspiration on reader inspiration remained the same. Total and indirect effects of writer inspiration on reader awe and chills remained the same, except that the significant indirect effect of writer inspiration on reader awe via originality became marginally significant (B = -. 007 [-. 015, .000], p = . 030). Total and indirect effects of writer effort on reader inspiration remained the same. In sum, the two methods of addressing the skewness issue yielded comparable findings in most cases. In most instances where findings differed between the two methods, differences were modest, but the effect happened to cross the threshold of significance (or marginal significance) in one direction or the

with the pleasant and appetitive nature of inspiration. We presume that this indirect effect is extraneous to epistemic transmission and instead reflects an inherent compatibility of pleasant ideas with the appetitive inspired state (but see also Thrash, Moldovan, Oleynick, et al., 2014, regarding ways in which inspiration may be negative or unpleasant).

Also important is the discrimination provided by the finding that contagion was not mediated by sublimity or originality, qualities theorized to lack the property of transitivity. Unlike insightfulness, sublimity does not lend itself to further transmission, because a sublime stimulus eludes comprehension. Although it may be deeply moving, it remains inherently other, without being fully internalized. Originality, similarly, ""belongs"" to its author and therefore is not available for further transmission. Further research is needed to determine why originality had a negative rather than null effect on reader inspiration. One possibility is that the author

salience evoked by an original text yields an unflattering social comparison (Lockwood & Kunda, 1997; e.g., originator vs. spectator or imitator). Another possibility is that originality per se, above and beyond insightfulness, pleasantness, and sublimity, is not regarded as intrinsically valuable and merely produces discomfort.

The fact that writer inspiration had both positive and negative indirect effects indicates inconsistent mediation. ""Inconsistent"" here does not mean unreliable; it means that the indirect effects vary in sign and therefore offset rather than augment one another. Thus, the total contagion effect (r = . 13) indicates the net result of the inspiring and uninspiring effects of inspired writing. We note that the complexity of this model is not captured by the term contagion, which falsely implies that writer inspiration promotes

reader inspiration through a single transitive process. Nevertheless, we have embraced this term because it connects our findings to established literatures on contagion of emotion (Hatfield, Cacioppo, & Rapson, 1993), affect (Kramer et al., 2014), and motivation (Radel, Sarrazin, Legrain, & Wild, 2010).

## Moderation of Inspiration Contagion

Reader response is widely recognized as having both generalized and idiosyncratic aspects (e.g., Fish, 1970). Whereas the contagion and mediation effects discussed above concern generalized (average) responses, our moderation analyses are attempts to explain idiosyncratic responses using basic personality traits as moderators of contagion.

As hypothesized, readers' openness to experience was found to moderate inspiration contagion, such that writer inspiration predicted reader inspiration more strongly among readers higher in openness. Conditional effect analyses indicated that contagion was absent for readers low in openness but present for readers moderate or high in openness. These findings are consistent with past findings regarding the evocation of inspiration (Thrash & Elliot, 2004; Thrash, Maruskin, et al., 2010) and with Plato's model of contagion, which suggests that only certain kinds of individuals-poets and rhapsodes-are sufficiently receptive that they hold privileged positions in the dissemination of eternal wisdom.

## Moderated Mediation of Inspiration Contagion

Although the mediation and moderation analyses address important ""second-generation"" research questions, they are limited in important respects. The mediation analysis focuses on indirect effects only for the average reader. The moderation analysis concerns moderation only of the overall (total) contagion effect, which may be attributable to moderation of one or more indirect effects. Accordingly, we also conducted moderated mediation analyses, which more fully exploit the power of conditional process analysis (Hayes, 2013). Two reader traits, openness and approach temperament, were found to moderate indirect effects. Given the complexity of these analyses, we focus on

the openness findings, which are particularly relevant to our theorizing. However, we encourage readers to also consider the provocative implications of the approach temperament findings and of the novel statistical phenomenon that we described above as inconsistent moderation of mediation.

Reader openness was found to positively moderate the indirect effect via originality, such that the conditional indirect effect was less negative for readers higher in openness. Reader openness was also found to positively moderate the indirect effect via sublimity, such that the conditional indirect effect initially became less negative, and then became more positive, with increasing levels of reader openness. In contrast, reader openness did not moderate indirect effects via insightfulness or pleasantness, which yielded uniformly positive conditional indirect effects. These findings explain why openness moderated contagion of inspiration. Readers higher in openness were more prone to contagion because they were less susceptible to the suppressing effect of the originality of inspired writing, and because the sublimity of inspired writing tended to promote rather than suppress contagion for these individuals.

A novel aspect of these findings is that the proneness of open readers to inspiration contagion appears not to be due to an openness to inspiring qualities per se. Open readers were not more responsive to the positively inspiring aspects of inspired writing (i.e., insightfulness, pleasantness)-these qualities were generally inspiring for readers regardless of their levels of openness. Rather, open readers were more open to incidental qualities of inspired writing (originality, sublimity) that undermined the inspiration of readers low in openness. We conclude that the potential for inspiration contagion via the written word lies in most individuals but tends to be manifest only in those who are sufficiently open to the more exotic (i.e., novel and sublime) writings in which inspired and inspiring (i.e., insightful and pleasant) ideas tend to be found.

# Discrimination of Inspiration Contagion From Contagion of Related States

In addition to documenting writer-reader contagion of inspiration, we also documented contagion of an emotion, awe, and of two basic affective states, PA and NA. These findings indicate that

writer-reader contagion generalizes across a variety of motivational, emotional, and affective states.

Core findings regarding the mediation and moderation of these other states may be summarized as follows. As hypothesized, contagion of awe was mediated by sublimity rather than insightfulness, but contrary to our hypothesis, awe contagion was moderated by reader approach temperament and not openness. PA and NA contagion were mediated primarily by pleasantness (high or low levels, respectively) and were moderated by approach temperament and avoidance temperament, respectively. Approach temperament also moderated NA contagion.

These findings indicate that inspiration contagion cannot be reduced to contagion of emotion or affect. Insightfulness was distinctively implicated as a mediator of inspiration contagion, and openness was distinctively implicated as a moderator of inspiration contagion. Consistent with the epistemic function of inspiration, this mediator and moderator are cognitive in focus, whereas their counterparts for awe, PA, and NA are affective in focus. Evidence of distinct contagion processes is noteworthy given that awe and PA are closely related to inspiration, both theoretically and empirically (Thrash, Moldovan, Oleynick, et al., 2014).

### Enthralling Effects of Inspiration

Moving beyond contagion, we found that writer inspiration predicted not only reader inspiration, but also two indicators of enthrallment: awe and chills. Enthrallment effects were positively mediated by insightfulness and sublimity and were negatively mediated by originality. (In addition, the pleasantness of inspired writing facilitated awe but undermined chills.) Thus, sublimity played a pivotal role in distinguishing the enthralling effects of writer inspiration from its inspiring effects-specifically, writer inspiration predicted sublimity, which, in turn, predicted awe and chills but not inspiration (see Figure 2A-C). Due to the additional positive indirect effect via sublimity, the effects of writer inspiration on reader awe (r = .30) and chills (r = .24) were stronger than the inspiration contagion effect (r = . 13), significantly so in the case of reader awe.

These findings highlight the fact that reader inspiration is not the only consequence of writer inspiration and may not be its most natural consequence. We emphasize that the function of inspiration is transmission (of ideas), not contagion (of inspiration). Contagion is merely one consequence of transmission by a writer, and enthrallment is another. Structural asymmetries in the writerreader relation, particularly the reader's relative passivity and less clearly specified avenues for action, may render enthrallment the more natural consequence. However, enthrallment states may themselves be viewed as incipient forms of inspiration that have the potential to become fully manifest following further contemplation of the inspired text.

Our inclusion of chills as an outcome is noteworthy given debates about the value of chills in pointing the way to truth and beauty in literature (Fish, 1970; Wimsatt & Beardsley, 1949) and to inspiration in the writer (Bowra, 1951; Lembke, 1973). Thus, it is striking that readers' chills responses were predicted by both insightfulness and sublimity-which correspond roughly to truth and beauty (but see Burke, 1759, and Ishizu & Zeki, 2014, regarding the distinction between beauty and sublimity)-and were distinctively diagnostic of writer inspiration (see Table 8). These findings link deeply felt bodily responses of readers to a deeply felt motivation in writers, suggesting a resonance driven by a shared perception of what is true and sublime about the human experience.

### Inspiration Versus Perspiration

Consistent with Valéry's theorizing, poems written by writers who exerted more effort were more inspiring to the average reader. However, we note three caveats regarding this finding. First, the effect of effort on reader inspiration was (partially) mediated by low rather than high originality. Second, the effect of effort was not unique in the sense that all other writer states (inspiration, awe, PA, NA) also predicted reader inspiration. Third, effort was the only writer state that failed to predict any other reader states (awe, PA, NA, chills). These findings suggest that effortful processes do not play a central role in the generation of deeply affecting language.

In future theory and research, it may be useful to distinguish two roles of effort. In the case of motivated effort, one exerts oneself as an expression of an underlying motivational impetus such as inspiration. In the case of volitional effort, one exerts oneself through an act of willpower because motivational resources are lacking. Although both kinds of effort are important, neither is consistent with the suggestion that genius is 99% perspiration and 1% inspiration. In the case of motivated effort, the purported benefits of perspiration may be attributable to inspiration or other motivations that underlie it. In the case of volitional effort, it would be peculiar to suggest that a chronic preponderance of willpower (which is ego-depleting; Muraven, Tice, & Baumeister, 1998) over spontaneous inspiration (which is vitalizing; Thrash, Elliot, Maruskin, & Cassidy, 2010) is desirable, much less the mark of genius.

### Broader Implications

Implications for the writer. Sadly, many students find writing to be a source of dread. Our diagnosis is as follows. Writing, like talking, is naturally a process of expression or articulation. However, many students understand this process in truncated

form, as an act of text generation, a creation of something from nothing. Exacerbating the problem, students are expected to be original and may be unaware that, as Collingwood (1938) and Barthes (1967) have argued, great writers draw heavily upon others' work. Lacking inspiration, the student contrives a text through volitional effort. The result is a ""brain-spun, invented work,"" as Tolstoy (1897/2014) described it. ""People are taught how to write a many-paged composition, without having anything they wish to say, on a theme about which they have never thought . . . This is taught in schools"" (p. 135). Our finding that inspiration is infectious points to a solution: students could be encouraged to look for stimulation in the most inspired and insightful works in their field and beyond. The act of writing then presents itself as a natural vehicle for capturing ensuing insights and elaborating upon them. Such insights are valuable whether they are revelatory (i.e., they involve the discovery and unveiling of existing ideas that have been overlooked or underappreciated) or creative (i.e., they involve a novel and useful integration of existing ideas; see also Derrida, 2002). For students higher in openness, who are more tolerant of the novel and sublime, inspiration is likely to be maximized, we propose, by a literature search or reading list that is more integrative and cross-disciplinary.

A second implication for the student writer is that one's level of inspiration while writing provides veridical feedback about the likely inspiration, awe, and chills of the average reader. This finding contradicts the presumption of some theorists that inspiration is merely subjective. For instance, Valéry (1958) stated, ""The treasures [inspiration] illuminates in our own mind's eye . . . are very far from having the same value in the eyes of others. What is of value to us alone has no value"" (pp. 213-214). Valéry's admirable concern about subjectivity is misplaced, because he implicates inspiration only by neglecting two kinds of base-rate information. Specifically, although it is true that inspired writing sometimes fails to inspire, (a) the fate of uninspired writing is worse, and (b) writing generated through other means (e.g., volitional effort) is also subject to falling flat, if not more so. The aspiring writer may also benefit from the knowledge that only readers high in openness are prone to contagion.

Implications for the self. In applying a general conceptualization of inspiration to writers and readers, we have implicitly identified the literary concept of authorship with the psychological concept of selfhood. We now develop a self-as-author metaphor more explicitly. First, both author and the self are implicated in writing-a text in one case and a life narrative in the other. Second, both encounter epistemic obstacles of existential significance. The author confronts a blank page, unsure what to say, and the self struggles with an unwritten future. Third, both have been celebrated as seats of an originating agency by some theorists (Deci & Ryan, 1985; Young, 1759/1918) and ridiculed as illusory by others, who instead emphasize deterministic effects of the stimulus environment (Barthes, 1967; Skinner, 1972). Finally, both find their voice when inspired (Bowra, 1951; Thrash & Elliot, 2004). During these elusive moments, determinism and agency are experienced as harmonized-inspiration is drawn (directly or indirectly) from the stimulus milieu, with the full endorsement of and active collaboration by a vitalized author-self. The author-self, at last, speaks with authority and authenticity.13

We call for self and well-being researchers to attend to this emergent, mediating self, which is not purely I or me, nor purely agentic or communal-such bifurcations are serviceable in the realm of mundane experience but not in the realm of selftranscendence. Like Plato's poet and rhapsode, the individual who participates in the transcendent is in a mode of transmissionexpressing, actualizing, or embodying (Thrash, Moldovan, Fuller, et al., 2014). As described by Nozick (1989), who used light as a metaphor for truth, beauty, goodness, and holiness, ""The ethic of light calls for a being to be its vessel. To be a being of light is to be its transmitter"" (p. 214). As long as psychologists neglect the mediating self and its embeddedness in transmission and contagion processes, they will misdiagnose the struggle to find one's voice as a case of, say, not working hard enough, not relating well enough to others, or not holding oneself in sufficiently high regard.

Implications for culture. Consistent with the self-as-author metaphor, inspiration contagion is posited to be broadly relevant across domains, rather than specific to the literary domain investigated herein. In the spiritual domain, for instance, the impulse to capture spiritual insight (revelation) in written form, coupled with a homologous impulse in readers to give voice to scriptural insights in their own lives, are arguably the cornerstones of the major world religions. Inspiration contagion is also applicable within the intellectual sphere, where the written text is the primary medium for transmitting insight in diverse academic fields. Even direct interpersonal contagion, which superficially has nothing to do with writing, may be viewed with greater fidelity through the self-asauthor lens. Being inspired by another is not a result of encountering an individual of superlative virtue or standing, nor of social comparison with such individuals-this is the heteronomous realm of the inspirational, not the authentic realm of the inspiring. Rather, inspiration results from encountering another whose actions speak the things one had wanted to say but had not been prepared to say unaided.14

In addition to being broadly relevant, inspiration contagion is far-reaching in its implications, playing a role in both the origins and evolution of culture. Regarding origins, the literary processes examined herein have a primordial, oral-aural counterpart dating back at least to archaic Greece, in which wisdom was disseminated through the live performances of poets and rhapsodes (Clark, 1997; Nagy, 1989; Rubin, 1995). We propose further that cultural evolution (Henrich, 2001) is shaped by inspiration contagion processes, in which individuals high in openness-a trait that has also been called culture-are inspired to build upon one another's most insightful ideas, innovations, and ideologies. Thus our model brings attention to the motivational and personality dynamics of cultural evolution.

#### Limitations and Future Directions

Effect size. A critic might argue that the inspiration contagion effect (r = .13) is weak by traditional standards. However, traditional standards are not applicable to our paradigm because they do not take causal distance into consideration. Inspiration contagion is inherently indirect in a truly distal sense. We did not examine, say, mediators situated ""between"" the text and the reader, but rather examined the distal effects of the writer ""behind"" the text. In addition, our paradigm is minimalistic relative to other contagion paradigms in that it concerns contagion of privately reported experiences (rather than of overt behavioral expressions) in entirely separate samples who never come into contact.

Moreover, for the following reasons, the impact of writer inspiration is greater than is suggested by the overall contagion effect. First, given inconsistent mediation, the overall contagion effect is necessarily less than the total absolute magnitude of the positive and negative effects of writer inspiration. Second, the contagion effect gauges impact for a single, average reader and therefore does not speak to total impact as multiplied across readers. Third, given moderation by reader openness, the contagion effect is stronger among open individuals-in whom contagion actually occurs-than it is on average. Finally, as noted, writer inspiration may lead more naturally to reader enthrallment than inspiration, and therefore the stronger enthrallment effects may provide a better indication of the impact of writer inspiration.

Generalizability. We expect our core findings to generalize beyond the particular writing domain, populations, study design, and cultural context investigated in this study, although additional research would needed to test this prediction empirically. We have already discussed generalizability to spiritual and intellectual domains. We now consider generalizability to other populations, study designs, and cultural contexts.

A strength of this study is that writers (and their poems) and readers were modeled as crossed random factors, establishing generalizability from our student samples to the populations from which they were drawn. Although we expect our core findings to generalize from student populations to populations of experienced writers and their readership, some differences in findings may be anticipated. For instance, it is possible that writer effort would be more predictive of reader impact in a study of experienced writers, who have a fuller repertoire of skills that may be summoned at will. Because the inspiration-perspiration distinction is a false dichotomy, this possibility would not imply that inspiration is less valuable to experienced writers. On the contrary, this same repertoire of skills may allow experienced writers to translate inspired ideas into completed products with greater efficiency and fidelity. We caution that investigation of contagion with elite writers may call for a commensurate population of elite readers. Keltner (2009) reported that exposing college students to top-tier poetry left them confused rather than awestruck, apparently because they did not understand the poetry or found it irrelevant to their concerns.

Our experimental study design involved active assignment of readers to poems and their authors. A benefit of this design is that the resulting Writer × Reader matrix had little missing data. A naturalistic design, in contrast, would likely yield a sparse matrix, because particular writer-reader pairings may not occur without experimenter intervention. This complication aside, we predict that contagion processes may be documented using a naturalistic design (see also Clark, 1997). Some important differences may be anticipated, however. In a naturalistic setting, readers have the freedom to selectively seek out preferred texts or genres. Our

<sup>14</sup> We could not have articulated this point without the guiding voice of Collingwood (1938).

moderated mediation analyses suggest that if readers low in openness (see the left sides of Figures 7A-D) gravitate toward texts that are pleasant and insightful but not particularly novel or sublimepreventing the suppression of contagion that would otherwise occur-they too may participate in inspiration contagion processes. Thus, our model may explain the evolution not only of revelatory and creative aspects of culture, but also its more traditional and mainstream aspects.

We acknowledge cultural constraints on contagion processes. Although inspiration contagion is posited to occur in all cultures, cultural influences on perceptions of insightfulness are likely to constrain transcultural contagion. As an extreme example, it is possible that the propaganda of Al-Qaeda and ISIS terrorists (Sivek, 2013) is both inspired and inspiring, but contagion is likely to be limited to the population of readers sympathetic to Islamist extremism. The possibility that some ideas are inspiring regardless of culture awaits future research.

Causal inference. Our integrative writer-reader study design may be regarded as an experimental-correlational hybrid. As noted, readers were assigned to poem stimuli (as in a standard experiment); however, writers and poems were sampled and their attributes (writer states, poem characteristics) were measured (as in a standard correlational study) rather than varied through the direct control of an experimenter. Lack of direct experimental control compromises the isolation of causal factors, and therefore a strong causal interpretation of our documented contagion and enthrallment effects is not warranted. However, experimental control of writer states is not possible in principal, because experimental control applies to manipulated stimuli, not to resulting states, which are dependent variables (for details, see Thrash, Moldovan, Oleynick, et al., 2014).

Although experimental control of writer states is not possible, we controlled covariates statistically in ancillary analyses. We caution that controlling other writer states is a conservative strategy, as discussed in the Results section. In the following, we note two key findings from these analyses. First, regarding overall effects of writer states on reader states, the enthralling effects of writer inspiration remained significant, whereas contagion of most states (inspiration, awe, PA) and the effect of writer effort on reader inspiration became nonsignificant. These findings bolster our conclusion that, for the average reader, enthrallment may be a particularly important consequence of writer inspiration.

Second, regarding mediation, the hypothesized indirect effects remained significant in the cases of inspiration, PA, and NA contagion; however, in the case of awe contagion, the hypothesized indirect effect via sublimity became nonsignificant. Although this null finding raises questions about the role of sublimity as a mediator of awe contagion, it may be an artifact of controlling an additional mediator unwittingly. Specifically, we propose that awe contagion is mediated not only by sublimity but also by writer inspiration, as in the following sequence: writer awe -> writer inspiration -> poem sublimity -> reader awe. This model introduces writer inspiration as a motivational intermediary (see also Adler, 2015), without which writer awe might not yield a text, much less an awe-inspiring one. We also note that this model is a straightforward extension of our enthrallment model. If this model is correct, then an indirect effect via sublimity would indeed be expected to become nonsignificant when writer inspiration is controlled, as in our ancillary analysis. However, firm conclusions await future studies designed to examine the temporal precedence of awe and inspiration in the writer.

# Conclusion

Previous research has demonstrated that inspiration is existentially exhilarating because the individual participates, as mediator, in the transmission of intrinsic value (Thrash, Elliot, et al., 2010; Thrash, Maruskin, et al., 2010). The present contagion and enthrallment findings situate the inspired individual in an even broader context of meaning. Our findings suggest that the inspired writer participates in the sweep of history, producing a text that is not just valuable but that enlightens, inspires, and raises the hairs on the arms of future generation of thinkers.

114,26785063,"# Failure at the Top: How Power Undermines Collaborative Performance

John Angus D. Hildreth and Cameron Anderson University of California, Berkeley

All too commonly, we see groups of leaders fail to accomplish their stated goals when working together-legislators who cannot agree on a bill, heads of state who cannot draft meaningful environmental policy, or boards of trustees who make disastrous decisions for their school. The current research examines whether groups of leaders fail as often as they do in part because of the power each leader is accustomed to possessing among his or her constituents. In multiple studies we found that high power individuals, when working together in groups, performed worse than did other groups: individuals randomly assigned power in an initial task were less creative when they then worked together in groups on a subsequent task (Studies 1A and 4). Individuals with higher power who worked together in groups were also less likely to reach agreement on a difficult negotiation task, whether these groups comprised actual executives from an extant organization (Study 2) or participants randomly assigned power in the laboratory (Study 3). Mediation analyses suggest that groups of high power individuals performed worse because they fought over their relative status in the group, were less focused on the task, and shared information with each other less effectively. However, high power individuals were more effective when working on tasks that required less coordination: they were more creative (Studies 1B and 4) and persisted longer on a difficult task than other groups. Therefore, group processes are the key problem for groups of high power individuals when they work together.

Keywords: power, groups, status, conflict, creativity

Individuals in positions of leadership are afforded a great deal of power. They are given control over decisions and group processes, and their ideas and opinions hold more sway than those of others. However, what happens when leaders have to interact and work with other leaders? How does the power they are accustomed to possessing shape their effectiveness when working with others who also hold power? This question is critical because important decisions and problems are often addressed not by individual leaders but by groups of leaders-in legislatures, boards of directors, or meetings between heads of state, for example. If groups of leaders fail, the damage can be profound. Legislators who cannot agree on a fiscal budget risk dire economic consequences, university boards of trustees who set bad policy can damage their

students' education, and leaders of disputing countries who fail to resolve their differences risk escalating their conflict into war.

On the one hand, one might hypothesize that the power leaders possess would help them perform particularly effectively in groups. Power is defined as an individual's capacity to modify others' states by providing or withholding resources or administering punishments (Emerson, 1962; Fiske, 1993; Keltner, Gruenfeld, & Anderson, 2003). The possession of power can boost individual task performance. When given power, individuals become more task-focused and goal-orientated, and more effective information processors (Guinote, 2007; Whitson et al., 2013). Power broadly influences an individual's goal system, which ""affects motivation and information processing in ways that promote more situated judgment and behavior [allowing] individuals to attain desired outcomes more easily"" (Guinote, 2010, p. 142). Further, power leads to greater task persistence and creativity (Galinsky, Magee, Gruenfeld, Whitson, & Liljenquist, 2008; Guinote, 2007; Smith & Trope, 2006). For example, Gervais, Guinote, Allen, and Slabu (2013) found that powerful people engaged in more creative thinking when creativity facilitated (rather than hindered) contextual goals. If power enhances individual performance as this evidence suggests, then by extension one might assume that groups comprised of high power individuals will perform better than groups of neutral or low power individuals. By a simple summation of their parts, groups of high power individuals should benefit from the additive effects of each individual's cognitive, affective, and motivational advantages.

However, this ""sum of its individual parts"" hypothesis ignores the critical role that group processes often have in determining overall group functioning and performance. Above and beyond having talented individuals, a group's performance depends on whether its members cooperate with each other, communicate effectively, and put selfish interests aside for the good of the collective (Hackman, 1990; Levine & Moreland, 1990; Kerr & Tindale, 2004; McGrath, 1964). Merely having superior talent is not enough for groups to be effective (Groysberg, Polzer, & Elfenbein, 2011), their members must also work together productively.

In the current research we test the hypothesis that when individuals with high power work with other high power individuals in groups, their power can have a negative effect on their performance. This hypothesis is based on prior work showing that the possession of power can cause individuals to behave in ways that hamper collaboration and effective interaction with others. For example, the possession of power can lead individuals to become overconfident in their own ideas (Sivanathan & Galinsky, 2007; Fast, Sivanathan, Mayer, & Galinsky, 2012), devalue the performance of others and take credit for others' contributions (Kipnis, 1972), become more self-focused and less concerned about others' welfare (Piff, Kraus, Côté, Cheng, & Keltner, 2010; van Kleef & Côté, 2007), become less polite (Keltner, Ellsworth, & Edwards, 1993), interrupt and speak out of turn (DePaulo & Friedman, 1998), and take others' opinions into account less (Briñol, Petty, Valle, Rucker, & Becerra, 2007; Galinsky, Gruenfeld, & Magee, 2003). Therefore, despite the performance benefits power can provide when individuals work alone, at the group level, the possession of power might disrupt group processes and, thus, dampen collective performance when individuals must coordinate.1

#### Prior Research

A few pioneering studies have begun to examine the effects of power on group performance. However, the findings from these studies are somewhat inconclusive. First, Greer, Caruso, and Jehn (2011) found that high power groups in an organization performed worse than other groups, consistent with our reasoning. However, those studies focused on powerful groups, rather than groups of people who individually have power and who must work together as a team-the focus of the current inquiry. Two studies came closer to examining teams of individuals who possess power individually, but they obtained different results: Groysberg and colleagues (2011) found that teams of financial analysts with a high proportion of ""stars"" (i.e., individuals who had been publicly recognized as high-performers) performed worse than teams with a moderate proportion of stars. Ronay, Greenaway, Anicich, and Galinsky (2012), on the other hand, constructed groups of uniformly high, uniformly low, or mixed-power individuals and found no performance difference between groups of high and low power members.

Second, if teams of high power individuals perform worse than other teams, the mechanisms underlying this effect remain unclear. Two aforementioned studies examined mediation: Greer et al. (2011) found in one study that process and relational conflict mediated the effect of power, whereas another study found process conflict only to mediate. Neither found task conflict to mediate. However, Ronay et al. (2012) combined all conflict variables together and found that overall intragroup conflict mediating the effect of high power (vs. medium power) but not any other comparison. It is, therefore, unclear which form of intragroup conflict matters. Furthermore, it is unclear from this work whether other additional mechanisms, above and beyond intragroup conflict, might also play a mediating role.

Third, the question of causality remains open. Greer et al. (2011) as well as Groysberg et al. (2011) conducted field studies and could not randomly assign members to groups or use experimental methods to establish causality. The only aforementioned study to use experimental methods (Ronay et al., 2012, Study 1) found null effects of power, for unknown reasons. Therefore, it is unclear whether the negative association between power and performance observed in Greer et al. (2011) or in Groysberg et al. (2011) was because of third variables, such as individual characteristics; perhaps individuals with certain characteristics tend to attain higher power, and these same characteristics lead individuals to work in groups less effectively.

The current research thus extends beyond existing work in a number of ways. It aims to conduct a more extensive examination of power in groups by using larger sample sizes and more robust experimental manipulations than have been used in prior research. These steps will help avoid the possibility of obtaining null effects of power simply because of low statistical power or to ineffective manipulations. It uses laboratory in addition to field designs to establish causality. It examines a wider range of potential relevant mechanisms to explain the effects of power (we elaborate on this issue in the next section). It examines a wider range of group tasks and performance variables, which helps establish the generalizability of the findings. It examines moderating conditions to better understand whether power might have positive rather than negative effects on group performance in some conditions (we elaborate on this issue below as well). Finally, it compares individual to group performance to rule out the possibility that any observed effects of power are because of individual rather than group processes.

#### The Mediating Role of Group Processes

As part of a more extensive examination of mediating mechanisms that might underlie the effects of power, we focused on four categories of processes: intragroup conflict over status, task processes, the positivity of intermember interactions, and other forms of intragroup conflict. These four kinds of processes have been shown in prior work to be important to group performance and to be likely affected by the possession of power. We outline our hypotheses regarding each of these processes below.

For the sake of simplicity, we will use the term ""high power individuals"" to refer to individuals who possess high power in one setting (e.g., in a prior task or social context) and who come together to work in a subsequent group, and ""low power individuals"" to refer to individuals who possess low power in one setting and come together to work as a group; ""neutral"" or ""control"" individuals possess neither high nor low power in a subsequent setting.

<sup>1</sup> Note that the abovementioned effects of power are not invariant. Many studies have shown that in some conditions, the possession of power can lead to heightened interpersonal sensitivity and attention to others (e.g., Côté et al., 2011; Overbeck & Park, 2001; Schmid Mast, Jonas, & Hall, 2009). However, a large body of findings suggests that power often leads to a behavioral pattern ill-suited to collaborating effectively in teams.

## Status Conflict

Prior research suggests status hierarchies pervade social groups, in that some members tend to attain more respect, admiration, and influence than others (Anderson, Hildreth, & Howland, 2015; Bales, Strodtbeck, Mills, & Roseborough, 1951; Leavitt, 2005). Although status differences tend to emerge cooperatively, with group members voluntarily ceding status to others, sometimes disagreements can emerge (Ridgeway & Diekema, 1989). Such status conflict involves ""disputes over people's relative status positions in the group's hierarchy"" (Bendersky & Hays, 2010, p. 323), and not surprisingly, status conflicts can severely harm group performance, damaging both task-related contributions and the relationships between group members (Bendersky & Hays, 2010).

Based on many of the effects of power described above, we believe status conflicts are particularly likely to emerge in groups of high power individuals. As already mentioned, power engenders overconfidence in one's abilities (Fast, Sivanathan, et al., 2012; Sivanathan & Galinsky, 2007), which leads individuals to feel entitled to higher status (Anderson, Willer, Kilduff, & Brown, 2012). Power also causes individuals to afford little status to others: they give less credit to others' contributions (Kipnis, 1972) and are more rude and disrespectful (Keltner et al., 1993). Therefore, when high power individuals work with other high power individuals, they would likely feel entitled to higher status than they would be given. That is, when a high power individual moves from one context in which he unambiguously more power than others to one in which his power is less clear, the carry over effects of power will likely exacerbate conflict over status as the powerful seek to reassert themselves and claim the status to which they feel entitled.

## Task Processes

The quality of a group's task processes is also critical to its effectiveness (Kozlowski & Bell, 2003; McGrath, 1964; Steiner, 1972). In particular, task focus is an important predictor of group performance: the less time or attention group members apply to a specific task the more likely their performance will be impaired (Karau & Kelly, 1992; Locke & Latham, 1990). We believe groups comprised of high power individuals are more likely to be distracted from the task at hand than other groups. As mentioned above, powerful individuals are more likely to pursue their own desires (van Kleef & Côté, 2007) at the expense of those of the group (e.g., completing their shared tasks).

Information exchange among members is also a critical component of group effectiveness. Group members must communicate their ideas and also integrate others' ideas into their own to generate optimal solutions to problems and reach agreement on difficult issues (Levine & Moreland, 1990; Shaw, 1971; Stasser, 1999). Previous research has shown that group performance suffers when group members fail to fully share or integrate the information available in a group (Argote, Ingram, Levine, & Moreland, 2000; Gruenfeld, Mannix, Williams, & Neale, 1996). We believe groups of high power individuals will fail to exchange information as effectively when they work together in groups. As noted above, high power individuals are ruder to others and attend less to others' opinions (DePaulo & Friedman, 1998; Galinsky et al., 2003). This pattern of behavior is likely to stifle both the

motivation to share information with others and the integration of members' ideas synergistically.

#### Positive Interactions

Groups whose members express positive sentiments toward each other also tend to perform better (Barsade, 2002; Carnevale & Isen, 1986; Bramesfeld & Gasper, 2008; George & Zhou, 2007; Gibson, 2003). Positive interactions are seen to build trust and communication and motivate members to contribute more to the group (Cunningham, 1988; Isen, Rosenzweig, & Young, 1991; Mason & Griffin, 2005). However, we believe groups of high power individuals are less likely to engage in positive interactions with each other. High power individuals' propensity to interrupt more often and speak out of turn (DePaulo & Friedman, 1998), ignore others' perspectives (Galinsky, Magee, Inesi, & Gruenfeld, 2006; Overbeck & Park, 2001, 2006), and devalue others' contributions (Kipnis, 1972; Pfeffer & Cialdini, 1998) implies groups of high power individuals would be less likely to positively reinforce each other's ideas, thereby hampering collaboration, cohesion, and performance.

#### Other Forms of Intragroup Conflict

As mentioned above, Greer and colleagues (2011) found inconsistent findings for the mediating role of relational, process, and task conflict. We examined those forms of intragroup conflict, in addition to status conflict. Given many of the above argumentsfor example that high power individuals will be ruder to each other and will fail to acknowledge each other's contributions-it is possible that these other forms of conflict will also emerge among teams of high power individuals. However, it is also possible that these other forms of conflict will be driven primarily by disputes over status; therefore, when status conflict is entered as a mediator, the other forms of conflict will fail to mediate.

#### The Moderating Role of Coordination

We also sought to understand the boundary conditions of the effects hypothesized above. If groups of high power individuals perform worse than other groups because of their more dysfunctional group processes, this suggests power would be particularly damaging to group performance for tasks that require higher levels of coordination among group members-for example, tasks in which group members must interact a great deal with each other, build from and integrate each other's input into their own work, synchronize their individual activities, and agree upon joint plans and strategies (Kozlowski & Bell, 2003; McGrath, 1964; Steiner, 1972). In contrast, the possession of power might not damage group performance for tasks that require less intermember coordination, such as ones in which members work individually and aggregate their work ex post (Hill, 1982). In fact, groups of high power individuals might outperform other groups for many tasks that require less coordination, given that possessing power can boost task-focus and goal-orientation (Guinote, 2007; Whitson et al., 2013).

#### Overview of Studies

We conducted five studies to test these predictions. In Study 1A we placed randomly selected participants in positions of power on an initial task and had them work with a subordinate. We then had these high power participants work with other high power participants in groups on a subsequent creativity task. In Study 1B, to help rule out the possibility that power might have led individuals to be less creative in general (i.e., an individual-level cognitive effect), we replicated the design of Study 1A but had participants work on the creativity task alone. In Study 2 we addressed generalizability by examining ""real world"" power and using a different group task. Specifically, we examined groups of actual executives in a large organization who were tasked with reaching agreement on a difficult decision despite group members' differences in opinion. Study 3 used the same negotiation task from Study 2 but experimentally manipulated power allowing for causal inference. In Study 4, to identify potential boundary conditions we had participants complete a series of tasks that varied in the level of coordination required. We expected groups of high power individuals to perform worse on a task that required more coordination but better on tasks that required less coordination. In all studies we used objective measures of performance and in Studies 1A, 2, and 3, independent judges to assess group processes from videotape of the group's interactions, which allowed us to avoid some of the biases in self-reported group performance.

Therefore, in our four key studies-Studies 1A, 2, 3, and 4-we examined groups and our unit of analysis was the group. Our main proposition was that groups of individuals who had held power in a prior setting would perform worse than would other groups, in particular on tasks that require more coordination, because their group processes would suffer.

#### Study 1A: Group Creativity

Creativity and innovative thinking are becoming increasingly recognized as critical life skills (Runco, 2014; Simonton & Damian, 2013; Sternberg & Lubart, 1996), and particularly important skills leaders must possess (e.g., Sternberg, 2013). It is often the case that groups of high power individuals must think creatively to solve important problems and overcome challenges-whether they are trying to build an international treaty to restrict greenhouse gases, generate a new strategy for their firm, or agree on a fiscal budget for their state. Therefore, in Study 1A we examined groups that worked on creativity tasks.

We tested the hypothesis that groups of high power individuals (i.e., individuals who held power in another context) would be less creative than groups of low power and neutral individuals (i.e., individuals who held low power in another context or who did not hold high or low power in another context). To test this hypothesis we gave participants high, low, or neutral power in an initial task, and then had them work together in groups with other participants who had also possessed high, low, or neutral power in an initial task.

We also tested our hypothesis that high power participants would perform worse in groups because of the way they work together-that is, because of the processes that emerge in their groups. Specifically, as outlined in the Introduction we focused on the level of status conflict among group members, the quality of the processes they used to accomplish their task, and how positive was the tone of members' interactions with each other. Greer et al. (2011) examined task, relationship, and process conflict (De Dreu & Weingart, 2003; Jehn, 1994, 1995) and found some inconsistent

effects on group performance, so we also measured those forms of conflict to establish whether status conflict mediated the effect of power above and beyond those forms of conflict.

### Method

Participants. There were 174 participants (81 women, Mage = 20.39, SD = 1.83) from a large West Coast University who participated in the study for either class credit or cash payment (\$15). All participants had the opportunity to earn additional money as outlined below. In total participants comprised 58 threeperson groups (18 High Power, 22 Control, 18 Low Power).

Procedure. Participants completed an online survey before the laboratory session that included measures ostensibly used in the laboratory power role assignments (see Anderson & Berdahl, 2002; Galinsky et al., 2003). Six same-sex participants were then scheduled for each laboratory session. Upon arrival to the laboratory, participants were told they would be completing three tasks during the session including (a) a tower-building task in pairs, (b) a creativity task in groups, and (c) a second tower-building task in pairs again (in fact this second tower-building task was never to run, but was used to bolster the power manipulation). Participants were also told that for each task the highest performers could win one of several prizes worth \$100.

To manipulate power, participants were randomly split into pairs and asked to work on a tower-building task in dyads. In some dyads, one participant was assigned to a high power role and given power over their partner; their partner was thereby assigned to a low power role. In other dyads, both participants were assigned to the control condition and neither had power.

After the tower-building task, participants were placed into three-person groups to work on a creativity task. Specifically, participants in the high power condition were grouped with the two other high power participants in their laboratory session, participants in the low power condition were grouped with the two other low power participants, and control participants were grouped with two other control participants.

Power manipulation. Each laboratory session was randomly selected to be either a treatment session or control session. In a treatment session, half of the six participants were assigned to the high power condition and the other half to the low power condition. In a control session, all participants were assigned to the control condition. Participants in the treatment session were told that to realistically simulate group decision making in organizations, some had been chosen to be leaders in the upcoming towerbuilding tasks, and others chosen as subordinates, based on their responses to the online leadership questionnaire (Anderson & Berdahl, 2002). They were also told leaders would evaluate the subordinates at the end of each task and that this evaluation would be used to determine how money would be allocated if the pair won one of the prizes described below (Galinsky et al., 2003). Participants in the control session were not told anything regarding role assignments but were merely asked to work together in dyads. Participants were then randomly assigned to dyads for the towerbuilding task, while ensuring that in the treatment session, high and low power participants were paired together.

Dyads were taken to separate rooms for the tower building task. Each dyad was given 30 tooth picks and 20 soft candy pieces (""dots""), and told that they had 5 min to build the tallest tower they could using the materials available. In the treatment sessions, both dyad members were told that the high power participant was to make all the decisions and that the low power participant was to follow directions. At the end of the task the high power participants were taken to a separate room and asked to complete an evaluation of their partner's performance and indicate how much money the partner deserved if the dyad won a cash prize. (In fact, this evaluation was never used.) In the control sessions, dyads were simply asked to work together. After completing the tower building task, all control participants were taken to separate cubicles to evaluate their team's performance and indicate how money should be allocated if they won a cash prize. (These evaluations were also never used.)

Creativity task. After the tower-building task, participants were assigned to groups of three. Each three-person group was comprised of participants in the same condition, such that three high power participants worked in a group, as did three low power and three control participants. Each group was taken to a separate room and given 15 min to complete a creativity task that involved inventing a new organization and charting its strategy. This task has been used successfully in prior groups research and allows for the effective assessment of group creativity (see Anderson & Kilduff, 2009; see Appendix for full details). The experimenter clarified that the group's performance would be judged solely on the creativity of their overall ideas. They were videotaped while working together.

Manipulation and suspicion checks. At the end of the laboratory session, participants completed a three-item measure of power: ""I was in control during the tower-building task,"" ""I got to make the decisions in the tower-building task,"" and ""I had more influence in the tower-building task,"" on a scale from 1 (completely disagree) to 7 (completely agree), a = .889. Participants also were probed for suspicion using two-item open-ended suspicion probes (Chen, Lee-Chai, & Bargh, 2001): ""Did you find anything strange or unusual about the experimental procedures?"" and ""What do you think is the purpose of this experiment?"" Participants were then debriefed, thanked and paid. Across all four lab studies, no participants guessed our hypotheses or recognized how the two tasks were related.

Creativity ratings. Prior research has shown that group members' evaluations of their collective performance and processes and of each other can be more vulnerable to biases than outside observers' judgments (e.g., Ilgen, Mitchell, & Fredrickson, 1981; Miller & Schlenker, 1985; Rush, Phillips, & Lord, 1981; Schlenker, Weigold, & Hallam, 1990). Therefore, in this and all group studies that follow, we use outside judges' ratings of group performance and processes.

Two independent judges blind to condition later rated the creativity of each participant's idea with the item, ""Using your own, subjective definition of creativity, please indicate the degree to which the idea is creative"" (Amabile, 1979) from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very). Previous literature (e.g., Amabile, 1983, 1996; Amabile, Conti, Coon, Lazenby, & Herron, 1996) has differentiated creativity on the two dimensions of novelty and usefulness. Along an exploratory vein we examined how power affected both of these dimensions of creativity. The judges rated novelty with the item, ""Overall, the idea is novel, i.e. ground-breaking rather than conventional or commonplace,"" and usefulness with the item, ""Overall, the idea is useful, i.e. it solves a problem and is valuable and relevant,"" (both items rated from 1 (disagree strongly) to 5 (agree strongly). The reliability of judges' ratings was good for all three items (overall creativity r = . 78, novelty r = . 82, usefulness r = .75, N = 58), so the judges' ratings were averaged for each item.

Group process measures. Two independent judges blind to condition separately observed the videos and rated each group's processes. First, judges rated the degree to which groups exhibited status conflict: ""members of the group competed for control over the group and its decisions"" (adapted from Bendersky & Hays, 2010). They also rated task, process and relational conflict: ""the group had frequent disagreements about the tasks they were working on,"" ""the group had disagreements about who should do what, i.e. the process they should use,"" and ""the group experienced personal conflict unrelated to the task"" (adapted from Jehn, 1997; Jehn & Mannix, 2001). All items were rated on a 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree) scale.

Second, judges rated the groups' task processes, including information sharing (""The group shared all of their information with each other"" from 1 [strongly disagree] to 7 [strongly agree]), task focus (""Overall, how focused was the group on accomplishing the task, i.e. how much did members appear to be engaged and attentive to the task itself?"" from 1 [very slightly/none at all] to 5 [very much]; adapted from Barry & Stewart, 1997), and how integrative was the group (""Overall, how much did group members build upon each other's ideas? i.e., how much did group members integrate different members' ideas into a common solution?"" from 1 [very slightly/none at all] to 5 [very much]).

Finally, to gauge the positivity of group interactions, judges rated the degree to which the groups exhibited positive affect (""In general, how much positive affect did you observe in the group? i.e., how interested, alert, attentive, excited, enthusiastic, inspired, proud, determined, strong, active were members of the group?"" adapted from Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988) and positive reinforcement (""How much positive reinforcement was given from one member to another? i.e., how much did group members accept, affirm, and complement each other's ideas?""). Both were rated on a 1 (very slightly/none at all) to 5 (very much) scale. All judges who coded these and subsequent videos were trained on how to interpret and code each measure using videos taken from pilot studies before coding the actual group interactions.

The reliability of judges' ratings for each measure was assessed after 20% of the videos had been rated and any conflicts resolved. Interjudge reliability was high for all dimensions: task conflict r = .83, relational conflict r = .91, status conflict r = .74, information sharing r = . 87, task focus r = . 80; integrativeness r = . 74, positive affect r = . 93, and positive reinforcement r = . 91. Unfortunately, the video-recording system failed midway through the experiment, which led to the loss of 18 groups' videos (six groups in each condition). Analyses that involve group processes are, therefore, conducted on the remaining data.

#### Results

Summary statistics for Study 1A are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Age, race, and sex were not significantly related to power condition or creativity. Further, controlling for these variables did not significantly affect any of our results. Therefore, these variables were not considered further in the analyses below.

Note. Means with different superscript letters are significantly different, p < . 05 (t test). SDs are in parentheses. N = 58 groups (18 high power, 22 control, and 18 low power) for creativity, novelty, and usefulness measures, n = 42 for other measures.

Manipulation check. The effect of the power manipulation on self-reported power was significant F(2, 169) = 54.307, p < .001, nº = . 391. Participants in the high power condition felt more powerful in the tower-building task (M = 5.91, SD = 1.40) than those in the control condition (M = 4.57, SD = 1.21) and low power condition (M = 3.20, SD = 1.45), p < . 001 and p < . 001, respectively. The difference between the control and low power conditions was also significant (p < . 001). At the group level, power condition was significantly related to average group selfreported power. F(2, 57) = 63.957, p < . 001, mp = . 699. The average group self-reported power in the high power condition (M = 5.91, SD = . 59) was significantly higher than that in the control condition (M = 4.59, SD = .72) and in the low power condition (M = 3.20, SD = . 83), p < . 001 and p < . 001, respectively. The difference between the control and low power conditions was also significant (p < . 001).

Were groups of high power individuals less creative? Summary statistics are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Power condition significantly affected creativity, F(2, 55) = 3.390, p = . 041, np = .110; this effect is also illustrated in Figure 1. Groups of participants in the high power condition produced less creative ideas than groups of participants in the control condition (p = . 011) and groups of participants in the low power condition (p = . 025). There was not a significant difference between groups of participants in the control and lower power conditions (p = . 964). The 95% bias-corrected confidence intervals (CIs; with 5,000 bootstrap samples) for the mean difference in group creativity scores were: high power versus control conditions [-1.1462, -. 2566]; high power versus low power conditions [-1.1594, -. 1503]; and control versus low power conditions [-. 6354, .6978].

Along an exploratory vein we also examined the novelty and usefulness of the ideas generated. Power condition significantly affected the generation of novel ideas, F(2, 55) = 4.342, p = . 018, n = . 136. As shown in Table 1, groups of participants in the high power condition produced less novel ideas than groups in the control condition (p = . 004) and groups in the low power condi-

tion (p = . 009). The difference between novelty scores of groups in the control and low power conditions was not significant (p = .504). In contrast to the novelty results, however, power did not affect the usefulness of the ideas produced, F(2, 55) = 2.040, p = .140.

Did groups of high power individuals engage in more status conflict? Also shown in Table 2, high power led to more status conflict F(2, 37) = 6.655, p = . 003, n3 = . 265. It also led to more task conflict F(2, 37) = 4.656, p = . 016, np = . 201, and more process conflict F(2, 37) = 3.921, p = . 029, n3 = . 175, but was not significantly related to relational conflict F(2, 37) = 3.006, p = . 062, np = . 140. Higher status conflict, in turn, was significantly related to less creativity, F(1, 38) = 10.712, p = . 002, adjusted R2 = . 198 (β = -. 469). Task conflict, process conflict, and relational conflict did not significantly predict creativity, however. Thus, we conducted a bootstrap analysis to determine whether the effect of power on creativity was mediated by status conflict. The 95% bias-corrected CI (with 5,000 bootstrap samples) excluded zero [-. 5449, -. 1148] indicating that status conflict mediated the effect of power on group creativity (see Figure 2). Therefore, groups with high power individuals were less creative in part because they engaged in more status conflict.

Did groups of high power individuals have worse task processes? As shown in Table 1, high power was significantly related to less task focus, F(2, 37) = 7.304, p = . 002, np = . 283,

less information sharing F(2, 37) = 7.934, p = . 001, n2 = . 300 and less integrativeness F(2, 37) = 4.077, p = . 025, np = . 181. Linear regression analyses revealed that task focus and information sharing, in turn, were significantly related to creativity F(1, 38) = 15.292, p < . 001, adjusted R2 = . 268 (B = . 536), and F(1, 38) = 8.208, p = . 007, adjusted R2 = . 156 (ß = . 421), respectively. The relationship between integrativeness and creativity was not significant F(1,38) = 1.576, p = .217. For task focus, the 95% bias-corrected CI (with 5,000 bootstrap samples) excluded zero [-.. 6286, -. 0577], indicating that task focus mediated the effect of power. For information sharing, the 95% bias-corrected CIs also excluded zero [-. 3628, -. 0342]. Therefore, task focus and information sharing also independently mediated the effect of power on group creativity, in addition to status conflict (see Figure 2). When all three mediators were entered into the same model both status conflict and task focus simultaneously mediate the effects of power on creativity though information sharing does not (95% CIs for the three indirect effects simultaneously: status conflict [-.4002, -.. 0040], task focus [-.. 5407, -. 0036], information sharing [- . 2489, .0442]). When just status conflict and task focus are included in the same mediation model, both mediated the effects of power on creativity (95% CIs: status conflict [-. 4351, -. 0217,] and task focus [-. 5611, -. 0279]).

Did groups of high power individuals have less positive interactions? Groups of high power individuals conveyed less positive reinforcement F(2, 37) = 7.477, p = . 002, np = . 288 (see Table 1). Power condition did not significantly influence positive affect however, F(2, 37) = . 694, p = . 506. Linear regression analyses revealed that positive affect and positive reinforcement were not significantly related to creativity, F(1, 38) = . 063, p = .804 and F(1, 38) = . 108, p = . 744, respectively.

Path analysis. We conducted a path analysis to assess (a) whether the simultaneous regression model illustrated in Figure 2 fit our data well and (b) whether this simultaneous regression model was better than an alternative, sequential, regression model in which group conflict precedes worse group processes. We used manifest indicators rather than latent variables to mitigate concerns regarding the statistical power of tests associated with structural equation models with relatively small sample sizes (Aquino, Mc-Ferran, & Laven, 2011; Chin, 1998). We estimated a path model that included the three significant mediators (status conflict, task focus, and information sharing) and permitted the two process

measures to covary as the associated error terms were correlated. The model fit the data well x2(2) = 1.786, p = . 168, comparative fit index (CFI) = . 956, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = . 117.

To assess whether this simultaneous regression model fit our data better than a sequential model, we estimated a second path model that included the three mediators in sequence (status conflict preceding the two process measures). The model fit the data reasonably well x2(3) = 1.689, p = . 167, CFI = . 942, RMSEA = .110. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) for the simultaneous regression model (AIC = 37.641) was similar to that of the sequential regression model (AIC = 37.387) suggesting both models fit our data well. Similar analyses confirmed that the simultaneous model was also a better fit for the data than the reverse sequential model (process measures preceding status conflict).

Summary. Groups comprised of high power individuals (i.e., individuals who had power in a prior context) were less creative than groups comprised of neutral or low power individuals (i.e., individuals who had neutral or low power in a prior context). Exploratory analyses found that power specifically reduced the novelty of groups' ideas. Moreover, power was highly disruptive to group processes: First, groups of high power individuals engaged in more status conflict when working together. Indeed, status conflict in particular mediated the detrimental effects of power on creativity. Consistent with prior research (e.g., Greer et al., 2011), groups of high power individuals also engaged in more task, process, and relationship conflict; however, those forms of conflict did not mediate the effect of power on creativity. Second, high power individuals were less focused on the task when working together, and they were less integrative and shared less information. Task focus and information sharing also mediated the effects of power on creativity. Finally, high power individuals gave each other less positive reinforcement when working together, though this did not mediate the effects on creativity.

It is interesting that the effects of power occurred primarily in the high power condition: the low power and control conditions did not differ on any variable, save the manipulation check. This is consistent with a host of prior studies that have also found stronger effects for possessing power than for lacking power (e.g., Anderson & Galinsky, 2006; Galinsky et al., 2003; Guinote, Willis, & Martellotta, 2010; Smith & Bargh, 2008). It suggests that while giving individuals high power might debilitate their ability to work with other high power individuals, giving individuals low power does not necessarily improve their collaborative performance above and beyond being in a neutral position.

# Study 1B: Addressing the Effects of Power on Individual Creativity

We have argued that when high power individuals collaborate in groups, they will work together in less effective and more dysfunctional ways, which in turn will hamper performance. Therefore, our model focuses on how power disrupts group processes, which in turn, damages group performance. However, a possible alternative explanation for the findings in Study 1A is that groups of high power individuals were less creative because of individuallevel cognitive effects as well. That is, the possession of high power in the tower-building task might have led participants to be less creative on subsequent tasks, regardless of whether they

worked in groups or worked alone. Power might have simply led individuals to be less creative on a general level. Although prior research has shown that the possession of power actually increases, rather than decreases, individuals' creativity when they work alone (Galinsky et al., 2008; Gervais et al., 2013), it is still possible the specific creativity task we used allowed for different effects of power than the creativity tasks used in prior research.

To address this possibility in Study 1B we used a nearly identical design and procedure that was used in Study 1A, including the same power manipulation and creativity task. However, participants in Study 1B completed the creativity task alone rather than in groups. By using the same creativity task we could address whether the effects observed in Study 1A were because of individual-level cognitive effects of power on creativity.

### Method

Participants. There were 116 participants (57 women, Mage = 20.80, SD = 1.54) from a large West Coast University who participated in the study for either course credit or cash payment (\$15). All participants also had the opportunity to earn additional money, as described below.

Procedure. The laboratory procedure was nearly identical to that used in Study 1A. Participants completed the same online survey before the laboratory session that included measures ostensibly used in the laboratory power role assignments. Six participants were again scheduled for each laboratory session. To manipulate power, participants were split into pairs and asked to work on the tower-building task as a dyad. In some dyads, one participant was assigned to a high power role and the other to a low power role. In other dyads, both participants were assigned to the control condition. After manipulating power through the dyadic task, participants then completed a creativity task. However, in contrast to Study 1A, the creativity task was completed alone rather than in groups. Participants were assigned to individual cubicles and given 15 min to complete the creativity task alone. Further, the creativity task was not videotaped as there were no interactions between participants to observe during this task. The experimenter again clarified that performance would be judged solely on the creativity of their overall ideas.

### Results

Age, race, and sex were not significantly related to power or creativity. Further, controlling for these variables did not significantly affect any of our results. Therefore, these variables were not considered further in the analyses below.

Manipulation check. Power condition had a significant effect on participants' self-reported power, F(2, 111) = 52.632, p < .001, no = . 487. Participants in the high power condition (M = 5.84, SD = .79) had higher self-reported power those in the control (M = 4.67, SD = 1.31) and low power conditions (M = 3.05, SD = 1.35), p < . 001 and p < . 001, respectively. Control participants also had higher self-reported power than low power participants (p < . 001). At the notional group level, power condition had a significant effect on the average group self-reported power, F(2, 39) = 52.047, p < . 001, m = . 738. Participants in the high power condition (M = 5.84, SD = .37) had higher self-reported power those in the control (M = 4.67, SD = .89) and low power conditions (M = 2.99, SD = . 77), p < . 001 and p < . 001, respectively. Average notional group scores for the control condition were also significantly higher than those for the low power condition (p < . 001).

Did power increase creativity? The power manipulation had a significant effect on participants' creativity, F(2, 111) = 4.988, p = . 008, np = . 082. Consistent with prior research, however, participants in the high power condition (M = 1.90, SD = .58) were more creative than those in the control condition (M = 1.50, SD = . 69) and those in the low power condition (M = 1.46, SD = .71), p = . 008 and p = . 005, respectively. There was not a significant difference in creativity between those in the control and low power condition, p = . 801. The 95% bias-corrected CIs (with 5,000 bootstrap samples) for the mean difference in participant creativity scores were: high power versus control conditions [.0986, .6706]; high power versus low power conditions [.1356, .7262]; and control versus low power conditions [-.. 3081, .3695].

Along an exploratory vein we again examined the novelty and usefulness of participants' ideas. Power had a significant effect on novelty F(2, 111) = 5.484, p = . 005, np = . 090. Participants in the high power condition (M = 1.93, SD = .71) generated more novel ideas than those in both the control (M = 1.51, SD = . 78) and low power conditions (M = 1.41, SD = . 71), p = . 016 and p = . 002, respectively. The novelty of ideas generated by those in the control and lower power conditions did not differ, p = .532. Similar to Study 1A, participants' power did not affect the usefulness of their ideas, F(2, 111) = 1.162, p = . 317. High power participants did not generate more useful ideas than others.

Summary. In contrast to Study 1A in which power reduced groups' creativity, Study 1B found that power increased individuals' creativity when they worked alone on a creativity task. This is suggestive that the findings of Study 1A were not because of individual-level cognitive effects. Power did not appear to decrease individuals' creativity in general; in fact, when working alone, power enhanced individuals' creativity. Instead, power appeared to damage group processes specifically, and the ways in which high power individuals worked with each other. In other words, high power individuals working together in groups were less creative than other groups despite the creative boost power provides individuals working alone. Exploratory analyses also found that power specifically boosted the novelty of participants' ideas, suggesting that power boosted divergent and innovative thinking when individuals work alone.

#### Study 2: Group Negotiation Among Executives

Study 2 extended beyond Study 1A in two important ways. First, we examined whether the effects observed in Study 1A generalize to individuals who have power in the real world. We assessed executives who worked for a large health care organization. Many of these executives held prominent positions in their medical facilities or as members of regional oversight committees, supervised numerous individuals with the ability to hire and fire, set salaries, and determine promotions. However, these executives also differed in their level of power. While some executives held roles such as Departmental Chief that afforded them power over hundreds of subordinates, others held much more specialized roles that afforded them much less power. We were thus able to examine whether groups of executives who had higher power in the organization would perform worse than groups of executives who held less power.

Second, we examined whether the effects of Study 1A would generalize to a different kind of group task, one that is also representative of the kinds of tasks groups of individuals with high power often must accomplish. Specifically, groups of individuals with high power often must come together and reach agreement on difficult decisions despite their opposing viewpoints-this is true of boards of directors, members of congress, or heads of state, for example. Therefore, we had groups of participants in Study 2 work on a negotiation task in which they role-played an organizational committee that must agree on which job candidate their company should hire. Each group member was assigned to advocate for a different candidate, and our key dependent variable was whether group members were able to overcome their differences of opinion and come to an agreement.

Participants completed their group task as part of a broader executive leadership program. By having all groups work on the same task at the same time, we also helped to control for an important potential confound. Within organizations, executives with different levels of power typically work on different kinds of problems. Those with more power tend to work on more important issues that have a broader impact on the organization compared to those with less power. Power can thus be confounded with the kind of problem on which groups work. We were able to avoid this confound by having all groups in Study 2 work on the same task.

The procedure in Study 2 was similar to that used in Study 1A except for the following differences: First, power was not experimentally manipulated across groups. Instead, groups were formed based on their power in the organization, with higher-power executives being grouped together and lower-power powerful executives being grouped together. Second, participants completed a negotiation task rather than the creativity task used in Study 1A. Third, participants completed the task in larger rooms where other groups also completed the same task. Finally, participants were given 30 min rather than 15 min to complete the group task.

## Method

Participants. There were 158 executives (62 women; 75 White; Mage = 40.6, SD = 5.14) from a large health care company who participated in the study as part of an executive leadership program. All participants were Doctors of Medicine with several years' post-MD experience managing different practices or functional areas of the business.

Online survey. Several weeks before the experimental session, participants completed an online survey that included a measure of their power in the organization. We used an eight-item measure (adapted from Sherman, Lee, Cuddy, Renshon, Oveis, Gross, & Lerner, 2012) that comprised three submeasures: two items related to the total number of subordinates the participants managed (α = . 981), two items related to the number of participants' direct reports (α = . 970) and four items relating to their authority in making decisions that affect those they lead, such as the ability to promote or demote subordinates (α = . 752). Consistent with Sherman et al. (2012), the first two submeasures were each log-transformed to reduce skewness; all three submeasures were then standardized and averaged to create a composite measure (α = .700). The composite scores of all the members of each
group were then averaged (M = 0.03, SD = .73, ranged from -1.43 to 1.44). Note that while Sherman et al. (2012) called their measure an index of leadership, it serves very well as an index of power, as having subordinates, direct reports, and the ability to promote or demote others are core features of power in organizations (Perrow, 1970; Pfeffer, 1981).

Allocation to group. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three hour-long sessions by the company. Within each session, participants were ranked according to their individual power in the organization. Initial group assignments within each session was made by allocating the four participants with the four highest power scores to the first group, the four participants ranked fifth through eighth highest power to the second group, and so on.2 In total, participants comprised 42 groups, including 32 groups of four participants and 10 groups of three. Moderation analyses confirmed that group size did not moderate the effects of power on any other variable. In addition, including a dummy variable for group size did not significantly affect any of the results. Thus, we analyze all groups together.

Group negotiation task and performance measure. Groups role-played an organizational committee that was charged with selecting their company's next Chief Financial Officer (CFO; full task materials are available upon request). All group members were given information about four job candidates. The group's task was to reach agreement in 30 min on which candidate should be the next CFO (as well as who was the second, third, and fourth choice). To mimic conditions in which individuals have differences in opinion and different motivations, each of the four group members were also randomly assigned to advocate for a different candidate. The experimenter clarified that all members of the group should advocate for their own candidates as best they could as well as to try to reach agreement as a group on the final ranking of candidates.

In contrast to Study 1A in which groups' performance was measured by the creativity of their ideas, here their performance was measured by whether or not they reached agreement despite their differences in opinion. The dichotomous measure ""agreement"" was coded 1 if the group agreed on which candidate was their first, second, third, and last choice in the time available and 0 if they reached an impasse. Four of the videos ended before the end of the group's discussion and so it was not possible to code agreement for these groups.

Group process measures. As in Study 1A, videotapes of the group discussions were rated by two independent judges blind to the hypotheses and condition. The reliability of judges' ratings for each measure were assessed after 20% of the videos had been coded and any conflicts resolved before the rest of the videos were coded (interrater reliabilities were status conflict r = . 79, task conflict r = . 85, process conflict r = . 89, relational conflict r = .95, information sharing r = . 97, task focus r = . 88, integrativeness r = . 93, positive affect r = . 80, and positive reinforcement r = .89).

are more likely to make first offers, make more extreme offers, give fewer concessions, and use threats (e.g., De Dreu, 1995; Magee, Galinsky, & Gruenfeld, 2007). We had two independent judges blind to condition and hypotheses code the number of concessions individuals made, and rated the degree to which the individual ""was inflexible and rigid in her/his argument"" on a 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree) scale. They also rated the extent to which individuals ""pursued her/his goals aggressively"" (on the same scale) and counted the number of threats made. The reliability of judges' ratings for each measure was high for all dimensions (number of concessions r = . 75, inflexible r = . 76, aggressive r = . 71, N = 42). There was zero variance between the judges' ratings for the number of threats. The judges' scores for each item were, therefore, averaged together to create combined scores for each measure.

Individual performance measure. Along an exploratory vein, we also wanted to address the effects of power on individual performance. This would again address whether high power hinders group performance because it hinders individual cognitive abilities (similar to what we examined in Study 1B). In this task, strong individual performance means delivering credible, persuasive arguments to convince other group members to adopt their candidate or to agree on a final set of candidates. Therefore, two independent judges blind to condition rated the quality of each individual's performance during the group discussions. For each member of every group they rated the extent to which they agreed with the following statement ""During the group task, to what extent did each member of the group exhibit credibility (knowledge, expertise)"" using the scale 1 (much less than others) to 7 (much more than others). Reliability was high (α = .92) and so scores were combined into an average measure of quality.

# Results

Summary statistics for Study 2 are shown in Table 3. Individual power was not related to age F(1, 155) = . 706, p = . 402, adjusted R2 < 0.001; sex F(1, 155) = 1.324, p = . 252, np = . 008; or race F(1, 155) = . 108, p = . 743, m = . 001. Similarly at the group level, power was not related to average age F(1, 40) = 1.023, p = .318, adjusted R2 = 0.001; the percentage of men in the group F(1, 40) = 2.135, p = . 152, adjusted R2 = . 027; or the percentage of Whites in the group F(1, 40) = . 012, p = . 912, adjusted R2 < 0.001. Moreover, controlling for these demographic variables did

We also wanted to rule out a possible alternative explanation for our findings. Namely, if we found that groups of high-power individuals reached an impasse more than other groups, it is possible that they did so simply because power leads to more aggressive and less conciliatory negotiation tactics. Prior research has shown that in negotiations, individuals with higher power (typically operationalized as having alternatives to the negotiation)

<sup>2</sup> To control for the possibility that participants with higher power might know each other better than do participants with lower power (thus, confounding power with familiarity to other group members), these initial group assignments were then adjusted using demographic information the company provided including the group they had been assigned to for the duration of the leadership program (i.e., their POD), medical center (a proxy for their geographical location), and functional specialty (e.g., Medicine, Neurology, Pediatrics, etc.). The adjustments to the initial group allocation were made with the aim of minimizing the variance of power within each group by swapping members of groups with adjacently ranked power and using the following order of priorities: First no two members of the group should be from the same POD; second, no two members of the group should have the same functional specialism; and third, no two members of the group should be from the same geographic location. Both priorities (1) and (2) were achieved. Nine of the 42 groups had pairs of members from the same geographic but different functional specialism. Moderation analyses confirmed that shared geographic location did not moderate the effects of power on any other variable.

not significantly affect our results in any way. Therefore, we did not consider the effects of demographic characteristics of participants further.

Were groups comprised of high power executives less likely to reach agreement? As predicted, a logistic regression analysis revealed that power predicted whether or not groups reached agreement (B = - 1.303, SE = . 625, Wald = 4.349, p = . 037). The 95% boot-strapped CI (5,000 bootstrap samples) for the coefficient B was [.164, 3.843]. For illustrative purposes and to compare the results with those from Study 1A, we tertiary-split the groups to compare the outcomes of groups with high power, moderate, and low power participants; this would be similar to high power, control, and low power groups in Study 1A. Power was significantly related to agreement x2(2, N = 38) = 5.052, p = .080. Groups whose members were in the highest tertiary of power in the organization were less likely to reach agreement (46%, 5 out of 11 groups) than groups whose members possessed moderate power (79%, 11 out of 14 groups) and, than groups whose members had the lowest power (85%, 11 out of 13 groups), p = . 087 and p = . 043, respectively. Groups whose members possessed moderate power and groups whose members had the lowest power did not differ, p = . 686 (see Figure 3).

Did groups of high power executives engage in more status conflict? Consistent with Study 1A, groups of high power executives exhibited higher levels of status conflict F(1, 40) = 10.732, p = . 002, adjusted R2 = . 192 (β = . 460). They also exhibited more task conflict F(1, 40) = 16.030, p < . 001, adjusted R2 = . 268 (B = . 535), process conflict F(1, 40) = 8.839, p = . 005, adjusted R2 = . 161 (ß = . 425), and relational conflict F(1, 40) = 7.786, p = . 008, adjusted R2 = . 142 (β = . 404).

Status conflict predicted the likelihood of reaching agreement: logistic regression analyses predicting agreement revealed that the coefficient for status conflict was B = - 1.143 (.438), Wald = 6.803, p = . 009. Task conflict (B = - . 1.027 (.423), Wald = 5.884, p = . 015); and process conflict (B = - 970 (.457), Wald = 4.500, p = . 034) were also negatively related to the likelihood of reaching agreement whereas relational conflict was not (B = -. 406 (.324) Wald = 1.567, p = . 211).

Thus, we conducted bootstrap analyses to determine whether the relation between power and agreement on the task was mediated

by status conflict, as well as task and process conflict. The 95% bias-corrected CIs (with 5,000 bootstrap samples) excluded zero for both status conflict [-2.2678, -. 0402] and task conflict [-. 3.2894, -. 0530] but included zero for process conflict [-1.3078, .0934] indicating that both status conflict and task conflict independently mediated the effect of power on the likelihood of agreement (see Figure 4). Groups comprised of high power executives were less likely to reach agreement than other groups in part because they engaged in more status conflict and more task conflict.

Did groups of high power executives have worse task processes? Higher power was also related to being less task focused F(1, 40) = 7.864, p = . 008, adjusted R2 = . 143 (β = - - . 405), sharing less information F(1, 40) = 10.289, p = .003, adjusted R2 = . 185 (ß = - . 452) and being less integrative F(1, 40) = 7.165, p = . 011, adjusted R2 = . 131 (β = - . 390).

Logistic regression analyses revealed that both task focus and information sharing were significantly positively related to the likelihood of reaching agreement: task focus B = 1.978 (.726) Wald = 7.424, p = . 006; information sharing B = 1.207 (.472) Wald = 6.544, p = . 011. The relationship between integrativeness and agreement in the task was not significant B = . 834 (.546) Wald = 2.344, p = .127. The 95% bias-corrected CIs (with 5,000 bootstrap samples) excluded zero for both task focus [-8.7420, -. 0963] and information sharing [-2.7765, -. 0792] indicating that both process measures independently mediated the effect of power on agreement. Groups comprised of high power executives were less likely to reach agreement in part because they were less focused on the task and shared less information (see Figure 4). When all four mediators are entered into the same model, the three key mediators of status conflict, task focus and information sharing simultaneously mediated the effects of power on creativity (95% CIs for the three indirect effects: status conflict [-27.45, -3.67], task focus [-14.00, -1.16], information sharing [-20.77, -3.80]) but the indirect for task conflict did not (95% CI [-2.20, 15,75]). When just the three key mediators are entered into the same model they continue to simultaneously mediate the effects of power on creativity (95% CIs: status conflict

[-14.38, -2.54], task focus [-11.55, -. 84], and information sharing [-16.64, -2.85]).

Did groups comprised of high power executives have less positive group interactions? Groups comprised of high power executives expressed significantly less positive reinforcement F(1, 40) = 10.574, p = . 002, adjusted R2 = . 189 (β = - . 457). Power was again not significantly related to positive affect F(1, 40) = 2.599, p = . 115. Logistic regression analyses revealed that neither positive affect nor positive reinforcement were significantly related to agreement B = .566 (.449) Wald = 1.591, p = . 207 and B = . 647 (.464) Wald = 1.941, p = . 163.

Aggressive negotiation tactics. It did not appear to be the case that groups of high-power individuals reached agreements less often because their members used more aggressive negotiation tactics. Groups of high-power individuals did not make fewer concessions B = . 223 (SE = . 221) t(40) = 1.010, p = . 319, were not more inflexible and rigid, B = - - 305 (SE = . 217) t(40) = 1.407, p = . 167, did not negotiate more aggressively B = -. 199 (SE = . 223) t(40) = - . 890, p = . 379, or make more threats B = -. 055 (SE = . 213) t(40) = - . 258, p = . 797. Moreover, failing to reach agreement was not significantly related to making fewer concessions B = - . 161 (SE = . 358), Wald = . 202, p = .653, inflexibility and rigidity, B = . 736 (SE = . 430), Wald = 2.929, p = . 087, using a more aggressive negotiation style B = .369 (SE = . 369), Wald = . 771, p = . 380, or using threats B = 3.206 (SE = 6,334), Wald = . 000, p = 1.000.

Path analysis. As in Study 1A, we conducted a path analysis to assess (a) whether the simultaneous regression model illustrated in Figure 4 fit our data well and (b) whether this simultaneous regression model was better than an alternative, sequential regression model in which conflict preceded worse group processes. We estimated a path model that included the four significant mediators (status conflict, task conflict, task focus, and information sharing) and permitted the two conflict measures to covary as well as the two process measures to covary as the associated error terms were correlated. The model fit the data well x2(4) = 1.167, p = . 323, CFI = . 992, RMSEA = . 067.

To assess whether this simultaneous regression model fit our data better than an alternative sequential model, we estimated a second path model that included the four mediators in sequence (the two conflict measures preceding the two process measures). The model did not fit the data well x2(4) = 5.779, p < . 001, CFI = .755, RMSEA = .341. The AIC for the simultaneous regression model (AIC = 38.666) was significantly better than that of the sequential regression model (AIC = 69.115) suggesting the simultaneous regression model was a better fit for the data. The simultaneous model was also a better fit for the data than the reverse sequential model (process measures preceding conflict measures).

Did high power groups perform worse because power undermined individual performance? Individual power was significantly positively, rather than negatively, related to the credibility and quality of individual arguments F(1, 155) = 16.743, p < .001, adjusted R2 = . 092. The average quality of arguments was also higher in groups comprised of high power participants F(1, 40) = 12.755, p = .001, adjusted R2 = .223, but was not related to group performance (i.e., agreement) B = -. 503 (SE = . 370), Wald = 1.846, p = . 174. Moreover, power remained marginally significantly related to agreement when controlling for average credibility of the group members' arguments B = 1.235 (SE = .728), Wald = 2.881, p = . 090.

Summary. The findings of Study 2 were consistent with those from Study 1A and help generalize the results in important ways. Groups comprised of actual executives with more power in their organization were significantly less likely to reach agreement on a difficult negotiation task than groups comprised of executives with less power in that same organization. Moreover, consistent with the findings of Study 1A, groups comprised of high power executives experienced greater status conflict, which mediated the effects of power on agreement. These groups also experienced greater task, process and relational conflict compared to groups comprised of lower power executives and task conflict mediated the detrimental effects of power on agreement. Groups comprised of higher power executives were less focused on the task, less integrative and shared less information than groups comprised of executives with less power and again, both task focus and information sharing independently mediated the effects of power on agreement. Power was not related to positive affect but groups comprised of executives with more power did engage in less positive reinforcement than groups comprised of executives with less power. The positive reinforcement was not related to the likelihood of agreement however. Groups comprised of higher power executives did not perform worse because power undermined individual performance. To the contrary, the credibility and quality of high power executives' arguments was better, lending additional support to the hypothesis that worse group processes explain the detrimental effects of power on group performance. Finally, groups of higher power executives did not reach impasse more often because their members used more aggressive negotiation tactics, which helps rule out that alternative explanation.

# Study 3: Experimental Manipulation of Group Negotiation in the Laboratory

The findings of Study 2 are of course correlational in nature and, although the findings held up after controlling for many potential confounds such as demographic variables, they are still subject to omitted variables bias and questions of causality. To increase the internal validity and establish causality, we thus returned to the laboratory in Study 3. Study 3 bridges the findings of Studies 1A and 2 by using the same controlled experimental methodology used in Study 1A and the same negotiation task used in Study 2. The procedure used in Study 3 was identical to that in Study 1A except for the following differences: First, eight participants rather than six were recruited for each session so that we could split participants into groups of four. Second, at the start of the laboratory session, before the power manipulation, participants were given 10 min to read the instructions for the group task and make notes. Third, as described above, the group task comprised the negotiation task used in Study 2 wherein members assumed roles on an organizational committee and had to choose their company's next CFO while being videotaped. Fourth, participants were given 20 min rather than 30 min to complete the negotiation.

# Method

Participants. There were 319 participants (178 women, Mage = 20.67, SD = 1.49) from a large West Coast University who participated in the study for either class credit or pay (\$15). As in Study 1A, all participants had the opportunity to earn additional money. Participants were scheduled eight at a time for each laboratory session. When fewer than eight participants attended a session and we could not form two groups of four, they were split up into at least two groups of three participants. In total 82 groups of participants (27 High Power, 30 control, 25 Low Power) including nine triads took part in the experiment. Moderation analyses confirmed that group size did not moderate the effects of power. Further, including a dummy variable for group size did not significantly affect any of the results. Thus the analyses combine all groups.

Group negotiation task and performance measure. Groups completed the same decision making task used in Study 2 but were given 20 min to complete the task. Groups were told that if they reached agreement they would have a better chance of winning a prize worth \$100. Moreover, each participant was also told he or she would have a better chance of winning a gift certificate if his or her own preferred candidate was selected by the group. The experimenter again clarified that all members of the group should advocate for their own candidates as best they could as well as to try to reach agreement as a group on the final ranking of candidates. The same dichotomous measure of agreement used in Study 2 was used in Study 3.

Group process measures. As in Studies 1A and 2, videotapes of the group discussions were rated by two independent judges blind to the hypotheses and condition. The judges rated the same group process dimensions as in Studies 1A and 2. The reliability of coders' ratings for each measure were assessed after 20% of the videos had been coded and any conflicts resolved before the rest of the videos were coded (interrater reliabilities were status conflict r = . 94, task conflict r = . 93, process conflict r = . 84, relational conflict r = . 92, information sharing r = . 89, task focus r = . 81, integrativeness r = . 83, positive affect r = . 88, and positive reinforcement r = .88).

We also again wanted to rule out the alternative explanation groups of high-power individuals might reach an impasse more often simply because power lead to a more aggressive and less

Table 5

conciliatory negotiation tactics. We had two independent judges blind to condition and hypotheses code the same dimensions as in Study 2. The reliability of judges' ratings for each measure was high for all dimensions (number of concessions r = .85, inflexible r = . 75, aggressive r = . 78, N = 82). There was again zero variance between the judges' ratings for the number of threats. The judges' scores for each item were, therefore, averaged together to create combined scores for each measure.

Individual performance measure. The quality of individuals' arguments was coded using the same methodology described in Study 2. Reliability was again high (α = .83) and so scores were combined into an average measure of quality.

Manipulation and suspicion checks. At the end of the laboratory session, participants completed the same three-item measure of power (a = . 902) and two-item open-ended suspicion probe used in Studies 1A and 1B.

## Results

Summary statistics for Study 3 are shown in Tables 4 and 5. None of the demographic variables of age, race, or sex was significantly related to power, agreement or the group process measures. Further, controlling for these variables did not significantly affect any of our results. Therefore, these variables were not considered further in the analyses below.

Manipulation check. The effect of the power manipulation on self-reported power was again significant F(2, 309) = 111.067, p < . 001, ng = . 418. Participants in the high power condition felt more powerful (M = 5.78, SD = 1.08) than those in the control condition (M = 4.80, SD = 1.07) and low power condition (M = 3.03, SD = 1.74), p < . 001 and p < . 001, respectively. The difference between the control and low power conditions was also significant (p < . 001). At the group level, power condition was significantly related to group average self-reported power F(2, 80) = 90.167, p < . 001, m2 = .698. Average scores of high power condition groups (M = 5.77, SD = .51) were significantly higher than those of control condition groups (M = 4.78, SD = .59) and

those of low power condition groups (M = 3.03, SD = 1.03), p < .001 and p < . 001, respectively. The difference between average scores of groups in the control and low power conditions was also significant (p < . 001).

Were groups of high power individuals less likely to reach agreement? As predicted, groups of participants in the high power condition were less likely to reach agreement (59%, or 16 out of 27 groups) than groups of control participants (80%, or 24 out of 30 groups) and groups of participants in the low power condition (88% or 22 out of 25 groups), x2(2, N = 82) = 6.309, p = . 043. The bootstrapped bias-corrected 95% CI (with 5,000 bootstrap samples) for the effect size n was [.021, .470]. Further, consistent with the findings in Study 1A, the effect of power was primarily driven by groups in the high power condition: their 59% agreement rate was substantially lower than that of groups in the control and low power conditions combined (84%, or 46 out of 55 groups total), x2(12, N = 82) = 5.836, p = . 016. In contrast, control and low power groups did not differ, x2(12, N = 55) = .638, p = . 425 (see Figure 5).

 Did groups of high power individuals engage in more status conflict? As shown in Table 4, high power condition was related to more status conflict F(2, 79) = 3.814, p = . 026, ng = . 088. It was also related to more task conflict F(2, 79) = 6.593, p = . 002, n = . 143, more process conflict F(2, 79) = 4.274, p = . 017, mp = .098, more relational conflict F(2, 79) = 4.996, p = . 009, np = .112. Status conflict (B = -. 693, SE = .214, Wald = 10.528, p = .001), in turn, was negatively related to the likelihood of reaching agreement. Task conflict was also negatively related to the likelihood of reaching agreement (B = - . 657, SE = . 220, Wald = 8.944, p = . 003) whereas process conflict and relational conflict were not: B = - . 336 (.202) Wald statistic = 2.758, p = . 097 and B = -. 318 (.206) Wald statistic = 2.370, p = . 124, respectively.

We conducted bootstrap analyses to determine whether the effect of power condition on rates of agreement was mediated by more status conflict and more task conflict. The 95% biascorrected CIs (with 5,000 bootstrap samples) excluded zero for both status conflict [-. 9789, -. 0630] and task conflict [-. 7500, -. 0582] indicating that both types of conflict mediated the effect of power on the likelihood of agreement. Consistent with Study 2, groups with high power individuals were less likely to

reach agreement in part because they engaged in more status conflict and more task conflict (see Figure 6).

Did groups comprised of high power individuals have worse task processes? Again, as shown in Table 4, power condition led to less task focus F(2, 79) = 3.215, p = . 045, mp = . 075, less information sharing F(2, 79) = 7.399, p = . 001, np = . 158, and less integrativeness F(2, 37) = 4.542, p = . 014, np = . 103. Logistic regression analyses revealed that both task focus and information sharing were significantly positively related to the likelihood of reaching an agreement: task focus B = 1.020 (.342) Wald = 8.897, p = . 003; information sharing B = 1.092 (.344) Wald = 10.085, p = . 001. The relationship between integrativeness and agreement was not significant B = . 073 (.283) Wald = .065, p = . 798. The 95% bias-corrected CIs (with 5,000 bootstrap samples) excluded zero for both task focus [-. 7286, -. 0298] and information sharing [- . 9699, - . 1461] indicating that both process measures independently mediated the effect of power on agreement. Consistent with Study 2, and as shown in Figure 6, groups comprised of high power individuals were less likely to reach an agreement in part because they were less focused on the task and shared less information than did other groups.

When all four mediators were entered into the same model, the three key mediators of status conflict, task focus and information sharing simultaneously mediated the effects of power on agreement (95% CIs for the indirect effects: status conflict: [-1.4018, -. 0204], task focus [-1.0442, -. 0436], information sharing [-1.3781, -. 0492]) whereas task conflict did not (95% CI: [-1.0185, .3145]). The three key mediators continued to mediate the effects of power on agreement when task focus was removed from the model (95% CIs for the three indirect effects simultaneously: status conflict [-1.5017, -. 3500], task focus [-2,2164, -. 4378], and information sharing [-2.0371, -. 1551]).

Did power reduce positive group interactions? Groups of high power individuals conveyed significantly less positive reinforcement F(2, 79) = 4.872, p = . 010, np = . 110. Power was not significantly related to positive affect F(2, 79) = 1.850, p = . 164 (see Table 4). Logistic regression analyses revealed that neither positive affect nor positive reinforcement were significantly related to the likelihood of reaching an agreement B = . 406 (.305) Wald statistic = 1.773, p = . 183 and B = . 349 (.333) Wald Statistic = 1.103, p = . 294.

We again conducted a path analysis to assess (a) whether the simultaneous regression model illustrated in Figure 6 fit our data well and (b) whether this simultaneous regression model was better than the alternative sequential regression model in which conflict preceded worse group processes. We estimated a path model which included the four significant mediators (status conflict, task conflict, task focus and information sharing) and permitted the two conflict measures to covary and the two process measures to covary as the associated error terms were correlated. The model fit the data well x2(4) = 1.743, p = . 137, CFI = . 971, RMSEA = . 096.

To assess whether this simultaneous regression model fit our data better than an alternative sequential model, we estimated a second path model, which included the four mediators in sequence (the two conflict measures preceding the two process measures). The model did not fit the data well x2(4) = 7.382, p < . 001, CFI = .749, RMSEA = .281. The AIC for the simultaneous regression model (AIC = 40.971) was significantly better than that of the

sequential regression model (AIC = 63.528) suggesting the simultaneous regression model was a better fit for the data. Consistent with prior studies the simultaneous model was also a better fit for the data than the reverse sequential model (process measures preceding conflict measures).

Did high power groups perform worse because power undermined individual performance? In contrast to the findings of Study 2, individual power condition was not significantly related to the quality of individual arguments F(2, 314) = . 287, p = .751, np = . 002. At the group level, power condition was also not significantly related to the average quality of group members' arguments F(2, 79) = . 306, p = . 737, np = . 008, and the quality of arguments was again not significantly related to agreement B = .205 (SE = . 473), Wald = . 189, p = . 664. Moreover, power remained significantly related to agreement when controlling for average credibility of the group members' arguments B = . 860 (SE = . 362), Wald = 5.653, p = . 017. Consistent with the findings of Study 2, individual performance did not explain the detrimental effects of power on group performance in Study 3.

Aggressive negotiation tactics. It again did not appear to be the case that groups of high-power individuals reached agreements less often because their members used more aggressive negotiation tactics. Groups of high-power individuals did not make fewer concessions F(2, 79) = 1.605, p = .207, were not more inflexible and rigid, F(2, 79) = 1.261, p = . 289, did not negotiate more aggressively F(2, 79) = 1.832, p = . 167, or make more threats F(2, 79) = 1.144, p = . 324. Moreover, failing to reach agreement was not significantly related to making fewer concessions B = .020 (SE = . 261), Wald = . 006, p = . 938, inflexibility and rigidity, B = - . 453 (SE = . 270), Wald = 2.814, p = . 093, using a more aggressive negotiation style B = - 298 (SE = . 268), Wald = 1.233, p = . 267, or using threats B = 2.218 (SE = 4,439), Wald = . 000, p = 1.000.

Summary. Groups of individuals who had been given power in a prior task were less likely to reach agreement on a decision in which they had opposing viewpoints than were groups of neutral or low power individuals. The experimental methodology of Study 3 helps establish causality and rule out alternative explanations for the findings of Study 2. Furthermore, consistent with Studies 1A

and 2, Study 3 found groups of high power individuals experienced greater status conflict than groups of neutral or low power individuals. Groups of high power individuals also experienced greater task and process conflict (consistent with Studies 1A and 2) as well as greater relational conflict. Status conflict again mediated the detrimental effects of power on agreement, as did task conflict in this study. Groups of high power individuals were less focused on the task, less integrative and shared less information than other groups and again, task focus and information sharing mediated the effects of power on agreement. Power was not related to positive affect but groups comprised of high power individuals did engage in less positive reinforcement than other groups. Differences in positive interactions were again not related to agreement in the task however. The quality of individual arguments did not differ between groups of high power individuals versus other groups lending additional support to the hypothesis that it is worse group processes rather than individual performance decrements explain the detrimental effect of power on group performance. Finally, as in Study 2, groups of high power individuals did not fail to reach agreement because their members used more aggressive negotiation tactics.

#### Study 4: The Moderating Role of Coordination

The primary aim of Study 4 was to examine boundary conditions for the effects we have observed thus far. In our prior studies, groups of high power individuals performed worse than other groups because of their more dysfunctional group processes: they engaged in more status conflict and shared information less effectively, for example. These findings suggest that the damaging effects of power on group performance will be particularly pronounced for tasks that require higher levels of coordination among group members-for example, tasks in which group members must interact a great deal with each other, build from and integrate each other's input into their own work, synchronize their individual activities, and agree upon joint plans and strategies (Kozlowski & Bell, 2003; McGrath, 1964; Steiner, 1972). In contrast, the possession of power might not damage group performance for tasks that require less intermember coordination, such as ones in

277

which members work individually and aggregate their work ex post (Hill, 1982). In fact, groups of high power individuals might outperform other groups for many tasks that require less coordination, given that possessing power can boost task-focus and goal-orientation (Guinote, 2007; Whitson et al., 2013). We investigated this idea in Study 4 by testing whether the effects of power on group performance are moderated by the type of task on which groups work and the level of coordination the task requires.

To address this first aim, we had groups complete a series of three tasks, one of which required more coordination (similar to the tasks in Studies 1A, 2, and 3), and two of which required less coordination. We used a repeated-measures design in which groups completed multiple tasks for two reasons. First, we wanted to examine whether the same groups of high power individuals who were less effective on high-coordination tasks would be more effective on low-coordination tasks. In other words, the relative effectiveness of groups of high power individuals can fluctuate from one task to another. Second, using a repeated-measures design would help boost statistical power, as compared with a between-measures design that would split groups into different conditions involving different tasks.

For the low-coordination tasks we used two ""unusual uses"" tasks, one that asked group members to generate ideas for using a cardboard box (e.g., Choi & Thompson, 2005; Hildreth, Moore, & Blader, 2014), and one that asked members to generate ideas for using a brick (e.g., Guilford, 1967). Group performance was measured by aggregating members' individual work, similar to many production teams (e.g., Hill, 1982; Lamm & Trommsdorff, 1973; Marquart, 1955; Shaw, 1932). For the high-coordination task, we asked groups to agree on a single most creative idea for using a cardboard box. That is, building from their abovementioned task in which they each generated creative uses for a cardboard box, we then asked them to work together and select their single most creative idea. We expected that groups of high power individuals would perform better than other groups on the low-coordination tasks but worse on the high-coordination task.

A second aim was to address an alternative explanation for our previous findings. Namely, it is possible that groups of high power individuals performed worse because their members worked less hard and contributed less overall. Prior research suggests that power can sometimes lead to less effortful cognitive processing (Keltner et al., 2003), and that low effort (loafing) leads to group performance deficits (Latané, Williams, & Harkins, 1979; Steiner, 1972). However, given that power leads to heightened task-focus and goal-orientation (Guinote, 2007; Whitson et al., 2013), we do not believe groups of high power individuals worked less hard than other groups.

To address this issue, we had groups work on a final, fourth task that assesses work ethic and persistence: a series of anagrams that become increasingly difficult, including one that is unsolvable. Many prior studies have used this task to gauge work ethic and persistence in the face of obstacles (e.g., Choi & Thompson, 2005; Ciarocco, Sommer, & Baumeister, 2001; Eisenberger & Shank, 1985; Segerstrom & Nes, 2007). The unsolvable nature of the task allows for a cleaner measure of persistence, independent of actual ability; groups that spend longer on the task can be said to have persisted longer and worked harder. We expected that groups of high power individuals would persist longer on the unsolvable

Using these tasks also helped accomplish a third aim. In our prior studies, we selected tasks based on their realism and proximity to actual tasks that groups of leaders or others might perform in organizational contexts. However, they were not tasks commonly used in the literature. The tasks we used in Study 4 have been used extensively in the research literature.

### Method

goal-orientation.

Participants. There were 175 participants (95 women, Mage = 20.59, SD = 1.45) from a large West Coast University who participated in the study for either class credit or cash payment (\$15). All participants had the opportunity to earn additional money as outlined below. Participants were assigned to 60 groups (30 High Power, 30 Low Power) including 55 three-person groups and 5 dyads.3

Procedure. The procedure was similar to the design used in Study 1A. As in Study 1A, after manipulating power via the tower-building task, participants were assigned to groups of three (all participants from the same power condition) and taken to separate rooms to complete their group tasks. However, there were two key differences here: (a) participants completed four focal group tasks rather than just one focal task. For each creativity task, participants were told that the top performing groups would receive \$100 prizes. (b) Participants were randomly assigned to only two power conditions, high power and low power. Our previous studies had already compared the effects of high- and low power to control conditions, and by splitting participants among two power conditions rather than three, we were able to further increase statistical power.

For the group tasks, the order of the cardboard box and brick tasks was counterbalanced. However, task order did not moderate the effects of power and, therefore, will not be discussed further. The unsolvable anagram task was always completed last, so that we could assess whether groups persisted on a difficult (impossible) task even after they had already expended considerable effort on prior tasks.

Low-coordination tasks. Participants completed two versions of the unusual uses task, one that involved generating uses for a cardboard box and the other generating uses for a brick. For each task, participants received the complete instructions, blank paper, and were prompted to spend a few minutes jotting down their ideas (Choi & Thompson, 2005; Guilford, 1967; Paulus & Yang, 2000; Torrance, 1968). For the cardboard box task, participants were told that their group would be judged on the creativity of the ideas they generated (emphasis in the stimuli). For the brick task, participants were told that they would be judged simply on

<sup>3</sup> In Study 4, three people voluntarily withdrew from the study early and consequently we asked another two to leave too. In one session a female subject withdrew immediately after the tower-building task because of illness but before the first group task, which meant the three-person group she has been assigned to became a dyad. Two male subjects in two other sessions withdrew before the first tower-building task but after providing consent without providing reasons. We withdrew their assigned towerbuilding partners at the same time and continued running the sessions with four subjects in two dyads per session. No data was collected from the subjects who withdrew or were withdrawn.

the number of ideas they come up with (emphasis in the stimuli). These different performance criteria allowed us to examine whether high power benefits different forms of generativity-that is, whether groups of high power would perform better on tasks with different creativity goals. For both tasks, it was made clear to participants that the aggregate of their individual work comprised their group's overall success (Shaw, 1932).

For the cardboard box task, two independent judges blind to condition and hypotheses rated the creativity of ideas in the exact way that was described to participants. The ideas were presented to coders in random order, not in order of condition. Judges' ratings were reliable (r = .76, a = .86), and thus, averaged together. For the brick task, our dependent measure was also measured exactly as described to the participants: by the simple total number of ideas generated. The distribution of the number of ideas was leptokurtic (y, = 3.76) and positively skewed (y, = 1.50) and so we logtransformed the number of ideas before running the analyses (Fox, 1997).

High-coordination task. Building from the cardboard box task described above, groups were given 10 min to choose one single most creative idea for a cardboard box together. The instructions stated that they would be judged solely on the creativity of that one idea they agreed upon as a group. Groups were given one piece of paper with three lines on which to write their group's most creative idea. Therefore, this task required much coordination among group members, including sharing their own ideas, listening to others' input, and reaching consensus as a group on the best idea. The creativity of this idea was rated by the same two independent judges who rated the earlier ideas for the cardboard box, who were blind to condition and hypotheses.

Anagram task. The anagram task involved four anagrams of increasing levels of difficulty, the last one being unsolvable, and participants were instructed to come up with one solution for each (Ciarocco et al., 2001; Eisenberger & Shank, 1985). The instructions stated that participants could spend as little or as much time on this task as they liked and to let the experimenter know when they wanted to stop. The instructions also indicated that there would be no prize for this task. There was sufficient experimental time for groups to assume they could spend at least 15-20 min on the task. However, the experimenter stopped any groups still

working on the task after 12 min to provide time for manipulation and suspicion checks and a full debrief.

As in prior work, our dependent measure was simply the time the group spent on the task (e.g., Ciarocco et al., 2001; Eisenberger & Shank, 1985), M = 551 s, SD = 165 s. This variable was right censored at 12 min and 16 of the 60 groups were still working on the task when the experimenter said stop. Therefore, we used a Tobit regression analysis (Long, 1997; Tobin, 1958) a type of regression model that treats responses at the maximum (12 min) as censored and, therefore, yields consistent results for this type of data where ordinary least squares regression would not (Amemiya, 1973). We also coded the number of anagrams the group correctly identified among those that were solvable, M = 1.28, SD = . 69. Although the unsolvable anagrams allows for a relatively clean measure of group persistence independent of group ability, we wanted to rule out the possibility that groups of high power individuals spent longer time on the task simply because they were worse at the solvable anagrams.

## Results

Summary statistics for Study 4 are shown in Table 6. Neither age nor sex of group members was significantly related to power condition or any dependent variable. The percentage of White group members unexpectedly predicted the creativity of ideas in the cardboard box task, but this finding did not hold across any other task or emerge in any of our prior studies, and controlling for all demographic variables did not significantly affect any of our results. Therefore demographic variables were not considered further in the analyses below.

Manipulation check. Participants in the high power condition reported feeling more powerful (M = 5.21, SD = 1.08) than those in the low power condition (M = 4.35, SD = 1.35) t(173) = 4.674, p < . 001, d = . 71. At the group level, average group self-reported power in the high power condition (M = 5.23, SD = .59) was significantly higher than that in the low power condition (M = 4.35, SD = . 78) t(58) = 4.916, p < . 001, d = 1.27.

Did task type moderate the effects of power on group performance? To test whether the effect of power on group performance was moderated by task type-specifically the level of

coordination required in the task-we z-scored groups' performance across all three creativity tasks and combined groups' z-scores in the two low-coordination tasks to compare with those groups' z-scores in the high-coordination task. A two-way 2 (power condition: high or low) × 2 (coordination: high or low) found that the effects of power on group performance depended on task type, F(1, 58) = 10.261, p = . 002, np = . 15. For the high-coordination task, groups of high power individuals performed worse than groups of low power individuals, t(58) = - 2.574, p = . 013, d = - . 66. The boot-strapped biascorrected 95% CI (with 5,000 bootstrap samples) for the mean difference in z-scored group performance scores between the high power versus low power conditions was [-1.0833, -. 1924]. For low-coordination tasks, groups of high power individuals performed no better or worse than groups of low power individuals, t(58) = 1.119, ns, the boot-strapped 95% CI for the mean difference in z-scored group performance scores between the high power versus low power conditions was [-. 1491, .6369]. In fact, examining the effects of power on each of the two lowcoordination tasks separately found that groups of high power individuals generated more creative ideas in the cardboard box task (M = 2.68, SD = .87), than did groups of low power individuals (M = 2.39, SD = . 87), t(58) = 1.971, p = . 053, d = .34. The boot-strapped 95% CI for the mean difference in z-scored group performance scores between the high power versus low power conditions was [.0059, .9914]. However, power condition was not significantly related to the log-transformed number of ideas that groups came up with for uses of a brick, t(58) = - . 113, ns. The boot-strapped 95% CI for the mean difference in z-scored group performance scores between the high power versus low power conditions was [-. 5237, .4578]. Therefore, it appears that groups of high power individuals performed even better in the cardboard box task. For illustrative purposes, the raw means for each task are presented in Figure 7.

Did groups of high power individuals persist longer on the anagrams task? Groups of high power individuals spent more time on the unsolvable anagrams task (M = 597 s, SD = 223) than did groups of low power individuals (M = 505 s, SD = 157), t(58) = 2.21, p = . 031, d = . 057. The boot-strapped 95% CI for the mean difference in group performance scores between the high power versus low power conditions was [8.14, 173.02]. Power condition was not significantly related to the number of solvable anagrams solved x2(2, N = 60) = 1.93, ns. The boot-strapped 95% CI for the mean difference in group performance scores between the high power versus low power conditions was [.001, .431]. Therefore, the effect of power on time spent was not simply because of differences in ability. Groups of high power individuals simply persisted longer than groups of low power individuals.

Summary. Consistent with hypotheses, the effects of power on group performance depended on the task and the level of coordination required among group members. In tasks that required less coordination among group members, groups of high power individuals performed better than groups of low power individuals. However, as in our prior studies, groups of high power individuals performed worse than groups of low power individuals on a task that required coordination among group membersspecifically one in which they were asked to agree on the most creative idea for a cardboard box. This latter finding is particularly striking, given that groups of high power individuals generated more creative ideas for a cardboard box when their members were not coordinating, and they brought these ideas to this task in which they were asked to coordinate and agree on the most creative idea for a cardboard box. Therefore, it again suggests that groups of high power individuals were less effective when forced to coordinate, despite the advantages they brought to the table. Furthermore, the benefits of coordination appear to be enjoyed by the powerless alone.

Also consistent with hypotheses, we found that groups of high power individuals spent longer on a task that was extremely challenging, and in fact impossible to complete, suggesting they persevered in the face of difficulties more than did groups of low power individuals. This finding helps rule out an alternative explanation for our previous results, namely that group of high power individuals performed worse simply because they worked less hard

# General Discussion

### Summary of Findings

A driving question motivating the current research was how the possession of power affects leaders' ability to work with other leaders. To address this question we examined high power individuals when they work together as a group. In four studies we found that groups of high power individuals (i.e., individuals who had high power in a previous task or in their organization) performed worse than other groups. Groups of high power individuals were less creative (Studies 1A and 4) and less likely to agree on a difficult decision (Studies 2 and 3). The effects of power were consistent regardless of whether power was manipulated experimentally (Studies 1A, 3, and 4) or measured naturalistically in a field setting (Study 2).

The deleterious effects of individuals' power on group performance stemmed from group interaction processes, and did not appear to stem from individual-level cognitive effects. That is, power hampered individuals' ability to work with others, but it did not appear to hinder their ability to think effectively. We found in Studies 1A, 2, and 3 that groups comprised of high power individuals performed worse because they experienced greater levels of status conflict and used worse group processes. Specifically, groups comprised of high power individuals not only fought over status more but were less focused on the task and shared less information with each other. The detrimental effect of power on group performance was mediated by the relatively higher levels of status conflict, and lower levels of task focus and information sharing that members of these groups experienced compared with members of other groups.

In contrast, the possession of power did not appear to damage individuals' creativity when they worked alone (Study 1B) or on group tasks that required less coordination (Study 4) and did not cause them to generate weaker arguments to support their case in the group negotiations (Studies 2 and 3). In fact, high power individuals were more creative when they worked alone (Study 1B) or worked on a task that required less intermember coordination (Study 4), and they offered more credible arguments in one of the negotiation studies (Study 2). These results are consistent with prior work, which has shown that power can provide performance benefits when individuals work alone or on independent tasks that require less coordination (e.g., Guinote, 2007; Magee & Galinsky, 2008; Whitson et al., 2013). High power individuals also appeared more motivated to solve a difficult (in fact impossible) task, despite there being no extrinsic reward for completing the task (Study 4). Taken together, our findings suggest that groups of high power individuals will tend perform worse when a high level of coordination is required, but will perform better when a low level of coordination is required.

## Implications

The current research helps us understand the behavior, performance-and perhaps most important, the failings-of those in power. Specifically, it can help explain why groups of high power individuals fail so often when they work together in collaborative efforts. Recent years have seen a ground swell of media attention and criticism of the performance of groups of leaders in the political and corporate spheres. Politicians are condemned for their inability to work together, to bridge across ideological lines, pass a budget, or agree on a bill (or any policy issue, really). Boards of directors are criticized for their failure to hold CEOs accountable for their performance or for failing to place limits on their compensation. While the possession and experience of power can make individuals more capable than others on individual tasks, that same power appears to undermine their ability to get along and work with each other on collaborative tasks. Interaction among the powerful is vulnerable to conflict and miscommunication that undermines their collective performance. Interventions to mitigate these risks are critical given the nature of the decisions these groups make and the impact those decisions have for wider society.

The present research identifies a number of mechanisms for the detrimental effects power can have on group performance. And, perhaps more importantly, identifying these mechanisms enables us to target where intervention strategies might be deployed to improve these groups' performance. For example, the higher levels of status conflict experienced by groups of high power individuals suggest that opportunities for mutual recognition and voicing of opinions should be identified so as to reduce the potential for status threat and conflict to arise. Formal information-sharing strategies might be implemented so that members of these groups are cognizant of all of the relevant information before making decisions thus mitigating the risk that relevant information is not shared. Structuring meeting time and formalizing decision processes may help these groups focus more on the task at hand than on other matters.

The current research contributes to the existing theoretical literature on the social psychology of power in several important ways. Though recent years have seen an explosion in the amount of research on the social psychology of power, prior research has focused heavily on the effects of power on the individual or within hierarchical contexts in which the powerful interact with the powerless. Very little social psychological research to date has examined interactions between individuals who possess power. The studies presented here begin to fill this lacuna in the literature. Critically, our findings suggest that simply extending the extant literature on the individual psychology of power to that of the group would be greatly mistaken. Groups comprised of high power individuals are not simply the sum of their (more capable) parts; indeed, far from it: groups of powerful individuals underperform relative to other groups when they are forced to coordinate with each other-precisely, it would seem, because of the members' individual power.

### Strengths, Limitations, and Future Directions

There were a number of important strengths to the data. First, in examining groups working together, we used laboratory experimental as well as field designs; this allowed us to not only infer the causal effects of power but also assess the generalizability of the findings to individuals who possess power in the real world. Second, we collected objective indices of performance such as independently rated individual and group creativity scores, and independently verified agreement outcomes. This removes the possibility that groups might have simply misreported their performance outcomes. Third, we collected video data of group discussions and had raters blind to condition and performance outcome rate the videos for process measures. This mitigates issues relating to the distorting effect of group attribution error on self-report measures (e.g., Allison & Messick, 1987).

While the current data had a number of strengths, there were of course limitations as well that should be addressed in future studies. First, future research should examine a wider range of tasks. For example, does power lead groups to make suboptimal decisions, fail to maximize joint gain in an integrative bargaining context, or generate less accurate solutions to problems? Although one could imagine the debilitating effects of status conflict and less effective information exchange would generalize to other contexts as well, this requires empirical assessment. Moreover, it is important to continue examining whether coordination moderates the effect of power on group performance.

Second, in the current studies participants came from the same subject pool (and thus, same school environment) or the work same organization, and might have felt as though they ultimately stemmed from the same ingroup. The contexts we studied were thus akin to contexts such as boards of directors or White House administrations where the individuals all fall within the same superordinate group. It is important to examine whether the same effects would emerge when powerful individuals who are part of different outgroups must work together. This would be similar to a meeting between heads of state or CEOs of different organizations, for example. It is possible that the deleterious effects of power on group performance would be exacerbated, given the lack of cohesion and collaboration that typically arises between members of different outgroups. However, it is also possible that because the powerholders of such groups occupy distinct status hierarchies (Frank, 1985), less status conflict would emerge and thus fewer problems would arise.

Third, it should be noted that this research was conducted on participants working or studying in the United States and, therefore, acclimatized to U.S. work habits and norms. It is important to test whether the detrimental effects of power on performance apply in cross-cultural settings given work is becoming increasingly global in nature. Moreover, power has been shown to have different effects on individuals from different cultures (Zhong, Magee, Maddux, & Galinsky, 2006), suggesting many findings in the current research might differ across cultures.

Fourth, a potential limitation of Studies 1A, 3, and 4 is that the change in contexts from one in which power is manipulated to one in which performance is assessed may act as a manipulation of power in itself and contribute to the effects we observed. That is, high power individuals might have suffered a loss of relative power and low power individuals might have enjoyed a relative gain in power when moving to a context in which they work with others equal in power to them. Study 2, helps mitigate this concern. However, future research should explore the extent to which changes in contexts affect perceptions of relative power.

Fifth, in the negotiation studies (Studies 2 and 3) it is possible that power may lead to people setting and holding more firmly to higher aspiration levels and reservations levels that might make

them less likely to reach agreements in negotiations because they are just not willing to give up enough to get the deal done. While we attempted to address this issue with by coding the extent to which participants appeared inflexible and rigid, future research should address this issue empirically by asking negotiators' aspiration or reservations levels beforehand. Future research should also consider the effects of power on alternative measures of group performance in negotiations such as the quality of negotiation outcomes, time to agreement or general satisfaction with the deal that would provide a more nuanced and richer understanding of the effects of power in these contexts beyond the relatively limited perspective provided by the dichotomous agreement measure used in the current studies.

Another interesting issue worthy of further study is whether high power members of groups are aware of each other's power. In the current research, participants were likely aware of the relative power of other members' of their group. In some group contexts such as juries, members of the group do not know each other's relative power. In other contexts, such as corporate executive teams, the clarity of relative power may depend on the extent to which reporting lines are articulated explicitly. To the extent that participants are aware of others' power, such knowledge may affect role expectations and subsequent behavior. This matters to the extent that changes in behavior are different between different conditions. It is possible that high power individuals are less concerned with others' relative power given their tendency to focus on themselves rather than others. In this situation, knowledge of others power matters less to the powerful than to those with less power. In contrast, to the extent that high power individuals are more conscious of threats to their standing in groups and the group context raises this concern, then high power individuals may be more likely to react than low power individuals in these contexts.

Though our research focused on groups of high power individuals, it is also important to examine the effects of status as well. Research is increasingly showing different effects for the possession of power and status (Blader & Chen, 2012; Fast, Halevy, & Galinsky, 2012). It is possible that groups of high status individuals might work well together, because status appears to promote more prosocial behavior and has positive benefits for information exchange (Wittenbaum, 1998, 2000). On the other hand, research also suggests that high status individuals are particularly threatened by the potential of losing status (Gruenewald, Kemeny, Aziz, & Fahey, 2004). Therefore, it is possible that high status individuals, confronted with other high status individuals, might feel threatened and react negatively.

Finally, research in the negotiations literature suggests the powerful feel more entitled and set higher reservation prices which leads them to claim more value (Pinkley, 1995; Pinkley, Neale, & Bennett, 1994; Giebels, De Dreu, & Van de Vliert, 2000). However, the extent to which the powerful achieve better outcomes depends on the distribution of power between the negotiation partners and the evidence is decidedly mixed with some research suggesting that a balance of power leads to better outcomes (e.g., Davidson, McElwee, & Hannan, 2004, p. 275; De Dreu & Van Kleef, 2004; Giebels et al., 2000; Mannix, 1993; Mannix & Neale, 1993; McAlister, Bazerman, & Fader, 1986; McClintock, Messick, Kuhlman, & Campos, 1973; Olekalns & Smith, 2013, p. 4; Pinkley, Neale, & Bennett, 1994; Rubin & Brown, 1975; Sheposh & Gallo, 1973; Wei & Luo, 2012; Wolfe & McGinn, 2005), and other research finding that hierarchy has more positive effects (e.g., Komorita, Sheposh, & Braver, 1968; Roloff & Dailey, 1987; Sondak & Bazerman, 1991; Tedeschi, Bonoma, & Novinson, 1970). One potential explanation for these mixed results might relate to the different levels of power present in these groups. That is, if the average level of power is high then power-balanced groups may perform worse than groups that are more hierarchical and vice versa. Future research should investigate this idea and also examine whether the powerful do indeed feel more entitled and set higher reservation prices in contexts in which power is not operationalized as the number or quality of alternatives as is common in the negotiations literature. Indeed "". . . when power is manipulated through the value of the best alternative, the sum of the parties' alternatives is strongly associated with integrativeness. This result is not surprising-the parties need to surpass their alternatives to reach agreement (Ben-Yoav & Pruitt, 1984)"" (Wolfe & Mcginn, 2005, p. 4).

## Conclusion

Our research posed the question of how leaders' power affects their ability to work with other leaders. The answer we found was disheartening. When individuals with power are assembled to work as a group on difficult issues, their power had a negative effect on their group's collective performance. Groups comprised of more high power individuals, be they students given temporary power or executives endowed with actual organizational power, performed worse than groups comprised of neutral or low power individuals-particularly on tasks that required more coordination among members. And, these detrimental effects of power on group performance are explained in part by members of these groups experiencing higher levels of status conflict, being less focused on the task at hand and sharing information less effectively with each other compared with other groups. In contrast, for group tasks that required little to no coordination, groups of high power individuals performed better than other groups. Thus, it appears that group processes are the major cause for failure when high power individuals must work together in groups.

# Andrew W. Delton, Jason Nemirow, Theresa E. Robertson, Aldo Cimino, and Leda Cosmides University of California, Santa Barbara

People regularly free ride on collective benefits, consuming them without contributing to their creation. In response, free riders are often moralized, becoming targets of negative moral judgments, anger, ostracism, or punishment. Moralization can change free riders' behavior (e.g., encouraging them to contribute or discouraging them from taking future benefits) or it can motivate others, including moralizers, to avoid or exclude free riders; these effects of moralization are critical to sustaining human cooperation. Based on theories of error management and fundamental social domains from evolutionary psychology, we propose that the decision to moralize is a cue-driven process. One cue investigated in past work is observing a person illicitly consume collective benefits. Here, we test whether the mind uses a 2nd cue: merely opting out of contributing. Use of this cue creates a phenomenon of preventive moralization: moralization of people who have not yet exploited collective benefits but who might-or might not—in the future. We tested for preventive moralization across 9 studies using implicit and explicit measures of moralization, a behavioral measure of costly punishment, mediation analyses of the underlying processes, and a nationally representative sample of almost 1,000 U.S. adults, Results revealed that merely opting out of contributing to the creation of exploitable collective benefits-despite not actually exploiting collective benefits-elicited moralization. Results further showed that preventive moralization is not due to the moralization of selfishness or deviance but instead follows from the uncertainty inherent in moralization decisions. These results imply that even people who will never exploit collective benefits can nonetheless be targets of moralization. We discuss implications for social and political dynamics.

Keywords: evolutionary psychology, error management, moralization, cooperation, collective action

Humans regularly work in groups to produce a good that is then shared. Many collective benefits, however, are vulnerable to free riders, people who take collective benefits despite not contributing to their creation. In response, free riders are often moralized-they are targets of negative moral judgments, anger, ostracism, or punishment (Fehr & Gächter, 2000; Kiyonari & Barclay, 2008;

Masclet, Noussair, Tucker, & Villeval, 2003; Price, Cosmides, & Tooby, 2002; Tybur, Lieberman, & Griskevicius, 2009; Yamagishi, 1986).1 Moralization can change free riders' behavior, encouraging them to contribute or discouraging them from taking benefits later. Moralization can also motivate others (including moralizers) to avoid free riders or exclude them from future cooperation. These functions of moralization are critical to sustaining human cooperation (e.g., Boyd & Richerson, 1992; Hauert, De Monte, Hofbauer, & Sigmund, 2002; Panchanathan & Boyd, 2004; Sasaki & Uchida. 2013; Tooby, Cosmides, & Price, 2006). Moral and social decisions, however, often involve uncertainty and potential error. How does uncertainty affect decisions about moralization? Does it predispose identifying a person as a cooperator-or as a potential free rider?

We address the relation between uncertainty and moralization by combining two approaches from evolutionary social psychology. First, we use a fundamental social domains approach to

<sup>1</sup> Our usage of the term moralization departs somewhat from past usage. In past usage, moralization has denoted the process by which an action. often previously lacking a moral component, comes to have a moral component-thereafter, engaging in (or failing to engage in) the action leads to moral condemnation and related responses (Rozin, 1999). We are using moralization as an umbrella term for a variety of negative moral and punitive responses to avoid having to use lists, such as ""moral judgment, moral condemnation, and punitive sentiment,"" when referring to the phenomena under investigation. Ultimately, however, our analysis ends up having much in common with moralization traditionally defined.

uncover some of difficulties involved in successfully creating and maintaining group cooperation (Bugental, 2000; Fiske, 1992; Kenrick, Li, & Butner, 2003; Kenrick, Neuberg, Griskevicius, Becker, & Schaller, 2010). Second, we use an error management approach to analyze how adaptive decisions about these problems should be made under uncertainty (Haselton et ak, 2009; Haselton & Nettle, 2006). Combining both approaches, we show that people who opt out of some forms of cooperation norsetheless become targets of moralization-despite not having taken group benefits. As a consequence, there may be errors of moralization of the innocentmoralization of people who will never illicitly take collective benefits.

#### Collective Action and Error Management

Successfully navigating social life brings huge benefits: friends and allies, safety and security, mates and children. But a single tool-a general purpose mechanism of sociality-cannot create all of these benefits (Tooby & Cosmides, 1992). Instead, the social mind appears to divide into multiple comains, with each domain having its own set of rules for generating adaptive behavior (Bugental, 2000; Kenrick et al., 2003, 2010. For instance, the decision rules sustaining long-term romantic relationships (Maner, Gailliot, & Miller, 2009; Maner, Miller, Rouby, & Gailliot, 2009) are different from the decision rules guiding intergroup interactions (Ackerman et al., 2006; McDonald, Navarrete, & Van Vugt, 2012).

Here, we focus on the decision rules guiding moralization within the domain of collective action. Collect ve action involves multiple people collaborating to produce a shared benefit. This type of cooperation appears in all known human societies (Bradfield, 1973; Olson, 1965; Ostrom, 1990). Many collective actions, such as national defense or environmental conservation, produce public goods. In public goods, non-contributors can free ride, benefiting from others' contributions (Dawes, . 980; Komorita & Parks, 1995; Van Lange, Liebrand, Messick, & Wilke, 1992). This illicit benefit consumption gives free riders higher payoffs than contributors, which threatens the evolutionary stability of public goods (e.g., Boyd & Richerson, 1992; Hauert et al., 2002; Panchanathan & Boyd, 2004; Tooby et al., 2006). To prevent free riders from proliferating or benefiting at the experse of cooperators, they are often targets of moralization, such as sanctioning or punishment (Fehr & Gachter, 2000; Kiyonari & Bacclay, 2008; Masclet et al., 2003; Price et al., 2002; Yamagishi, 1986). Moralization encourages free riders to contribute, prevents them from accessing collective benefits, or otherwise reduces payoffs relative to contributors. But identifying free riders is a difficult problem (Delton, Cosmides, Guemo, Robertson, & Tooby, 2012), and not all potential free riders pose the same challenges (Cimino & Delton, 2010; Delton & Cimino, 2010). What are the decision rules that generate moralization and what are the cues used by these decision rules?

To examine potential cues leading to moralization, we adopt error management theory (Haselton et al., 2009; Haselton & Nettle, 2006), which has successfully been applied to a number of questions involving groups and cooperation (Delton, Krasnow, Cosmides, & Tooby, 2011; Kiyonari, Tanida, & Yamagishi, 2000; Krasnow, Delton, Tooby, & Cosmides. 2013; Maner et al., 2005; Yamagishi. Terai. Kiyonari, Mifune, & Kanazawa, 2007). Error management analyses are based on two assumptions. First, the true state of the world is often ambiguous. Imagine your nighttime route home takes you by dense foliage in an area inhabited by jaguars. Does the foliage hide a hungry jaguar? Second, different types of errors often have different costs. If you wrongly assume there is a jaguar, you pay the cost of a longer route to avoid the area. But if you wrongly assume no jaguar is present, you might face injury or death. When a particular decision problem has been evolutionarily recurrent and has asymmetric error costs, natural selection should shape decision rules to avoid making the costlier error-even at the expense of making a larger number of low cost errors. Thus, if dark, dense foliage predicted the presence of predators over human evolution, then it should generate fear and avoidance-even if predators are rarely present and thus on most occasions avoidance is a waste of time and energy.

Public goods create a similar decision problem: Free riding is a strategic decision but often not an overt, observable behavior; thus, the mind must use fallible cues to identify free riders (see Delton et al., 2012, for further discussion). One confluence of cues that reliably discriminates free riders from others is the taking of collective benefits with the intention of withholding contributions (Delton et al., 2012; Fehr & Gächter, 2000; Masclet et al., 2003; Yamagishi, 1986).

But what predictions follow when considering the component cues in isolation? First, is the overt action of taking collective benefits enough to elicit moralization? Recent research shows that it is not, in part because human cooperation evolved in uncertain, variable environments. In such environments, moralizing people who take collective benefits must be partially decoupled from whether a person has contributed because accidents or bad luck can cause even well-meaning cooperators to fail to contribute (Delton et al., 2012; Delton & Robertson, 2012). What about opting out of contributing? Can non-contribution elicit moralization even if no collective benefits have actually been consumed? This situation creates uncertainty because a person who opts out may-or may not-later take collective benefits; their future actions cannot be perfectly known.

Given the possibility that a person who opts out of contributing to a public good might illicitly take the benefits in the future, should they be moralized now? There are two possible errors you could make: (1) moralize them even though they will not illicitly take the benefits, or (2) fail to moralize them even though they will illicitly take the benefits. The cost of the first error is the time and energy that moralization requires. In some cases, this cost can be quite low if moralization is spread across multiple people (Boehm, 1993), lowering the cost of moralization in the moment and lowering the likelihood that any particular moralizer will be retaliated against (one cost of moralization is the potential for its targets to retaliate; e.g., DeScioli & Kurzban, 2013; McCullough, Kurzban, & Tabak, 2013; Nikiforakis, 2008). This first error, moreover, has the potential to encourage someone to contribute when they otherwise might not, even if they would not have consumed collective benefits. (There are also cases where the costs of preventive moralization could be quite high; we return to this in the general discussion.} The cost of the second error is potentially more dire: the destruction of cooperation that occurs when free riding is allowed to proliferate, whether considered over the lifespan of any particular collective action or over evolutionary timescales. This asymmetry predicts that decision rules should be biased toward moralization in public goods, even if moralization is not ""rationally"" warranted given that no benefits have been illicitly consumed

Having such a sensitive trigger would create a phenomenon of preventive moralization: moralization of non-contributors now because of what they might do in the future. This prevention might function in several related ways. It might cause a person who opts out to change their behavior and cooperate in the present collective action, thereby legitimizing any benefits they do consume. It might cause a person who opts out to refrain from consuming benefits of the current collective action. It might prevent them from illicitly taking benefits from future collective actions by excluding them from later cooperation. Or it might cause the moralizer or others to avoid the non-contributor in the future, indirectly preventing the non-contributor from reaping the benefits of cooperation. In all of these cases, moralization occurs without any benefits having been illicitly consumed. Although preventive moralization would have the effect of often stopping free riding before it starts, it will necessarily create another type of error: the moralization of people who are not and will not become free riders.

## The Present Research

#### Studies 1-5: Testing Against Alternative Hypotheses

The preventive moralization hypothesis predicts that opting out of a public good engenders moralization. However, perhaps opting out of any cooperative endeavor elicits moralization, even if the benefit generated does not have the structure of a public good. Opting out may be viewed, for instance, as selfish or showing a lack of conformity, attributes that might be moralized in any group context. To show that the preventive moralization hypothesis has any unique predictive power-over and above other potential causes of moralization-we compared public goods to goods where free riding is not possible, club goods. Unlike public goods, by definition the benefits of club goods are available only to contributors; non-contributors cannot access them (Crosson, Orbell, & Arrow, 2004; Sandler & Tschirhart, 1997). Many early analyses of club goods were conducted on literal clubs, voluntary organizations where people can pay fees to become a member and enjoy member-only privileges. Health clubs, for example, are club goods in that they allow only paying members to access their exercise equipment. The structure of club goods (e.g., being behind locked doors), requires a person to contribute before the good can be accessed; free riding is therefore difficult or impossible.

Nonetheless, because the successful provisioning of public and club goods requires member contributions, both types of goods can be negatively impacted by, for example, selfishness or deviance, For instance, air quality in cities (a public good) is diminished if people burn proscribed materials or do not maintain their cars; a fraternal lodge (a club good) may close down if enough members fail to pay their dues. Similarly, across both goods, motivation to recruit labor is also constant: For both goods, additional contributors are likely to increase available benefits.2 This creates an economic incentive to encourage others to contribute, and moralization may be one means to this end. But despite these parallels, free riding is only possible on public goods, so public goods should elicit preventive moralization over and above that elicited by club goods.

Thus, we conducted five studies contrasting public and club goods. To establish a wide empirical base for the preventive moralization hypothesis, we measured moralization in several ways, including implicit associations (using the Implicit Association Test; Greenwald, Nosek, & Banaji, 2003; Lane, Banaji, Nosek, & Greenwald, 2007), explicit moral judgments (using rating scales), and experimental game behavior (using costly punishment); our data collection also included a nationally representative sample of almost 1,000 adults in the United States. Measuring both implicit and explicit responses is important given the ongoing debate regarding the role of fast, intuitive mental systems versus deliberate conscious reasoning in moral judgment (Bloom, 2010; Haidt, 2001, 2007). Because preventive moralization has not been previously examined, however, there is no clear theory predicting whether implicit associations, explicit responses, and costly punishment will show intra-individual correlations. Indeed. judgments of wrongness and decisions to punish may serve somewhat different functions and thus may be dissociable (Cushman, 2008; Lieberman & Linke, 2007). So although each measure should reveal greater moralization toward non-contributors on a public good compared to a club good, we have no prior hypothesis that an individual who shows, for example, strong implicit associations would be especially likely to punish. Our goal is simply to cast a wide empirical net. Nonetheless, in an exploratory fashion, we test for correlations between measures whenever possible.

Many theoretical treatments analyze ""pure"" public or club goods: In a pure public good, free riders benefit just as much and just as easily as cooperators; in a pure club good, free riding is impossible. Such pure versions are unlikely to obtain in real life: most goods exist somewhere on a continuum between these two points. Although we use the terms public and club goods for convenience, we are only using them to denote relative differences and do not intend for our discussion or our experiments to generally imply pure versions.

## Studies 6-9: Process and Quantitative Variation

We had several goals with Studies 6-9. First, we wanted to examine the underlying process that gives rise to preventive moralization. According to the preventive moralization hypothesis. when someone opts out of a public good moralization is elicited because there is a chance they will eventually free ride. This leads to the following model (see Figure 1): Cues to potential free riding are perceived, leading to an estimation of the likelihood of free riding by a person opting out, in turn leading to greater moralization. We sought confirmatory statistical evidence for this putative causal chain using mediation analyses.

Second, with Studies 6-9 we wanted to examine a number of different possible cues that could lead to variation in perceptions of the likelihood of free riding. Each study manipulated a different possible cue to the likelihood of free riding: non-contributors' subjective valuation of the good, non-contributors' cost if they free rode, the ability of contributors to monitor the good and prevent free riding, and the benefits non-contributors can obtain if they do free ride

<sup>2</sup> Sometimes additional contributors are not beneficial (e.g., in step-level goods when a sufficient number of contributors is already reached), but this can apply equally to public and club goods.

Figure 1. Theoretical model of preventive moralization.

Finally, with Studies 6-9 we wanted to examine quantitative variation in the likelihood of free riding. Studies 1-5 used stark, dichotomous contrasts: In the club goods, free riding was difficult or impossible; in the public goods, free riding was easy, free riding delivered the same benefits as contributing, and non-contributors were likely to free ride. Although this design was useful for an initial demonstration of the effect and for ruling out alternatives, it has two related drawbacks. First, the designs of Studies 1-5 treated preventive moralization as an all-or-none phenomenon. By quantitatively varying the likelihood of free riding in Studies 6-9, we investigated whether preventive moralization is a quantitative phenomenon that responds in degrees, r.ot absolutes. Second, the designs of Studies 1-5 only allowed us to observe preventive moralization in cases where free riding was highly likely to occur. With Studies 6-9, we sought to show that preventive moralization could also happen even in situations where free riding was clearly not guaranteed.

#### Study 1: Moralization in Public Versus Club Goods

As an initial test of the preventive moralization hypothesis, Study 1 contrasted public and club goods and measured moralization implicitly and explicitly. Participar.ts learned about a group of college students who had the option of participating in a carwash fundraiser for an upcoming hiking trip. In the public good condition, the carwash proceeds approximated a public good, paying group-related expenses for all hikers regardless of their carwash participation. In the club good condition, the carwash proceeds approximated a club good, being divided only among carwash participants. Importantly, no one-contributor or non-contributor-was depicted consuming benefits. Indeed, the carwash had not yet occurred; contribution was manipulated by stated intent, not a completed act.

## Method

Participants and design. One hundred seven undergraduates (53 women) in introductory psychology or anthropology classes at the University of California, Santa Barbara, participated for course credit or for \$10 compensation. Participants worked at private computers that randomly assigned conditions between subjects. First, participants read about a collective action-a carwash fundraiser-producing either a public or club good. Second, participants saw photos of the individuals involved in the collective action and learned who did and did not intend to contribute. Third, participants completed a memory test to ensure they accurately remembered contribution intentions. Fourth, they completed an Implicit Association Test (IAT) measuring implicit moralization. Finally, they made explicit moral wror gness ratings.

## Materials and procedure.

Public good versus club good manipulation. All participants read about a group of college students who independently signed up for a hiking trip through their campus recreation center. Participants learned that the recreation center was planning a carwash fundraiser to help defray trip expenses. In the public good condition, they further read the following: ""All the money generated by the carwash will then go toward paying the costs of the trip for everyone. Even if someone decided not to participate in the carwash, they would still benefit from the trip costs being paid."" In the club good condition, they further read the following: ""All the money generated by the carwash will be divided equally among the people who came. These people will then be able to apply their share of the profits toward paying their individual trip costs.""

Learning about contributors and non-contributors. Participants next serially viewed randomly ordered photos of eight college-age white men. They learned that four intended to contribute (""this person decided to go to the carwash""), and the remainder did not (""this person decided to stay home""). Between participants, the computer randomized which photos were paired with which decisions. Because the IAT requires knowledge of contribution intentions, participants repeated a memory test (with feedback) until they correctly identified all eight men's intentions twice in a row.

#### Dependent measures.

Implicit Association Test (IAT). To measure moralization of non-contributors, participants completed the IAT according to standard protocol (Greenwald, Nosek, & Banaji, 2003; Lane, Banaji, Nosek, & Greenwald, 2007). The IAT measure uses reaction times in a dual categorization task to assess how strongly two dimensions are associated. In Study 1, participants simultaneously categorized faces of contributors and non-contributors as intending to contribute or not contribute (implemented with non-evaluative labels: ""staying home"" vs. ""going to carwash"") and categorized eight positively- and eight negatively-valenced morally evaluative words as good or bad. The eight positive morally evaluative words were as follows: fair, noble, upstanding, principled, honorable, trustworthy, integrity, and virtuous. The eight negative morally evaluative words were as follows: dishonest, cheater, unethical, wrongful, corrupt, sinful, shady, and crooked.

Participants completed several blocks of trials, including practice and familiarization blocks. On the critical trial blocks (used to score the IAT) participants categorized all types of stimuli, with the stimulus type (i.e., contributor, non-contributor, positive word, negative word) randomly determined each trial. Importantly, despite categorizing four types of stimuli, participants used only two response keys (the ""A"" and ""L"" keys). One block, for instance, might use a single key to respond both ""staying at home"" and ""bad."" Such trials are consistent because not contributing and negative moral evaluation should be associated (and similarly for contributing and positive moral evaluation). Other blocks have the opposite pairing, using a single key for ""staying at home"" and ""good."" Such trials are inconsistent because not contributing and positive moral evaluation should not be associated; indeed, these

responses may compete. When trials are consistent-when the stimulus types ""go together""-responses should be relatively quick. When trials are inconsistent-when the stimulus types conflict-responses should be relatively slow. The IAT is based on this response time difference (along with standardization to remove within-participant response time variability; see Greenwald et al., 2003; Lane et al., 2007). Beyond being instructed that the IAT measured their ability to classify words and objects into groups, subjects were not given any further rationale for the task.

We scored the IAT according to standard protocol (Greenwald et al., 2003; Lane et al., 2007). Thus, all latencies greater than 10 s were deleted (for Studies 1 and 2, this was less than 1% of trials). In principle, participants with greater than 10% of latencies under 300 ms are removed; in this experiment, no participant met this criterion. The scoring algorithm produces an IAT D score, with greater scores indexing stronger associations between noncontributors and negative moral words and between contributors and positive moral words. We computed both overall IAT D scores, based on all four types of stimuli, and separate IAT D scores for each stimulus type. The preventive moralization hypothesis most strongly predicts differences in the non-contributor score, with greater IAT D scores in the public good condition relative to the club good condition. For completeness, we also provide the other separate IAT D scores.

Explicit rating scale. Explicit moralization of the noncontributors was assessed by the question ""Some organization members decided to stay home instead of going to the carwash. How morally wrong do you think it was of them to make this choice?"" with a 7-point rating scale (1 = not at all wrong, 7 = very wrong). The preventive moralization hypothesis predicts greater explicit moralization in the public good condition, relative to the club good condition.

Analysis strategy. All analyses used two-tailed p-values. Mean differences were tested using independent samples t-tests. Pearson's r was used to measure correlations between dependent measures. We also used Pearson's r as a measure of effect size for mean differences (Rosenthal, Rosnow, & Rubin, 2000). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test for interactions between independent variables. To determine whether there were any sex differences, prior to our main analyses we conducted preliminary analyses on our dependent measures using ANOVA with two factors (condition and participant sex); these analyses revealed no interactions with participant sex.

#### Results and Discussion

Did public goods, relative to club goods, lead to more explicit moralization? Yes: Non-contributors on a public good were rated as more morally wrong, r = . 33, p < . 001 (see Table 1).

Did public goods, relative to club goods, lead to more implicit moralization? Yes: As shown in Table 1, implicit associations between non-contributor-bad and between contributorgood were stronger in the public good condition. This difference in implicit associations is reflected in the overall IAT D score (r = .29, p < . 01) and the non-contributor IAT D score (r = . 25, p = .01).

Interestingly, associations indexed by the contributor and positive word IAT D scores showed greater positivity in the public good condition (ps < .05). There was no effect for negative moral words. We note that there was no interaction between contributor/ non-contributor and good type in predicting IAT D scores (p = .96). Finally, all IAT D scores were significantly greater than zero in both the club and public goods conditions (all ps < . 05). Although our experimental manipulation affected IAT D scores. even in the club good scenario there were significant implicit associations between non-contribution and badness and between contribution and goodness.

Were implicit and explicit moralization correlated? No. the explicit ratings did not correlate with either the overall IAT D score (r = .03) or the non-contributor IAT D score (r = -.. 02). We return to this in the general discussion.

#### Study 2: Further Constraining the Club Good

Study 1 provided preliminary evidence for the preventive moralization hypothesis: People who were potential beneficiaries of a public good but opted out of contributing to its creation were moralized. Moralization occurred more strongly in a public good, relative to a club good, despite both involving group cooperation. Thus, our effect is not attributable to causes that are present in all forms of group cooperation. For instance, group cooperation might require some level of conformity or group-directed effort. This does not differ, however, between club and public goods; creating both goods requires successfully coordinating with others and investing effort on behalf of the group. Study 2 was designed to replicate Study 1 with different stimuli and to tighten the contrast between conditions. In Study 1, the club good was ultimately privately held (money divided among contributors), whereas the

public good was communally owned (a joint fund). In Study 2, the club good was also communally owned (as is typical of club goods in institutional analysis; e.g., Ostrom, 2003; Sandler & Tschirhart, 1997). Study 2 also used a different club good exclusion mechanism. Study 1 used physical exclusion: With the money physically divided among contributors, non-contributors could not benefit without outright theft. In Study 2, exclusion from the club good relied on social pressure.

In Study 2, participants read about a village of African hunterhorticulturalists who subsist partly on fish. Villagers can participate in collective actions that create access to fish. In the public good condition, they can move trees that have fallen upriver, preventing fish from swimming past their village. With the trees removed, no one-contributor or not-can be prevented from fishing. In the club goods condition, villagers can use fallen trees to create a fishing pier near the village in full sight of the villagers, with the understanding that only contributors are to use it.

## Method

Unless noted, the method is identical to Study 1.

Participants. One hundred twelve undergraduates (58 women) participated for partial course credit. Two additional participants were eliminated for having >10% IAT trials faster than 300 ms. Two further participants were eliminated for not successfully finishing the memory test.

Materials. In both conditions, participants read about the Samana, a (fictional) hunter-horticulturalist group living in Botswana, Africa. Eight computer-generated images of African men represented the Samana. Whether they were ""staying home"" or ""going upriver"" was randomized between participants.

Participants learned that the Samana subsist partly on fish from the (fictional) Pata river. The Pata runs for a great distance such that ""even if someone wanted to sep another person from using the river, it would be nearly impossible. The riverbanks are far too long."" Participants also learned that a recent earthquake caused several large trees to fall upstream. In the public good condition, the trees blocked fish from swimming near the village. Because of the blockage, the Samana are organizing a collective action to remove the trees. The more Samana who participate, the easier the task is for those involved. Finally, participants learned that ""because the banks of the Pata are long and the fish are very easy to catch from the water's edge, all members of the Samana would benefit from the removal of the trees by the party that travels

upriver, even those Samana who have decided not to travel upriver to remove the trees, '

In the club good condition, participants learned that the fish tend to swim in the middle of the river, where fishing is difficult. The fallen trees will finally allow the Samana to construct a fishing pier, creating easy access to the fish. Given this opportunity, the Samana are organizing a collective action to bring the trees back to the village and build the pier. The more Samana who participate, the easier the task is for everyone involved. Finally, participants learned that ""all members of the Samana understand that only villagers who go to gather the logs necessary to construct the fishing pier will be able to use it. In fact, the Samana will build the fishing pier in plain sight of the entire village: With all the other members of the village watching, no one would ever try to use the fishing pier unless they helped gather the logs to build it.""

# Results and Discussion

Our analysis strategy was identical to Study 1. As before, preliminary analyses to examine whether our effects were moderated by participant sex used ANOVA and revealed no interactions involving participant sex. We therefore moved on to testing our focused hypotheses.

Did public goods, relative to club goods, lead to more explicit moralization? Yes: Despite a tighter contrast between the public and club goods, not intending to contribute to a public good was rated as more wrong, r = . 33, p < . 001 (see Table 2).

Did public goods, relative to club goods, lead to more implicit moralization? Yes: Again despite the tighter contrast, there were greater implicit associations in the public good condition between non-contribution and badness, for both the overall IAT D score (r = . 19, p < . 05) and the non-contributor IAT D score (r = . 20, p < . 05; see Table 2). Unlike Study 1, there was no effect for the contributor IAT D score (r = . 12). However, there was also no interaction between contributor/non-contributor and good type on IAT D scores (p = .34). There was a trend for both IAT D scores for words to be influenced by good type (see Table 2). As in Study 1, all IAT D scores were significantly greater than zero in both the club and public goods conditions (all ps < . 05); even in the club good scenario there were implicit associations between non-contribution and badness and between contribution and goodness.

Summary. Despite a variety of changes-different photos, different scenarios, different instantiations of goods-Studies 1 and 2 both supported the preventive moralization hypothesis: Opting out of a public good, relative to a club good, elicited more moralization. But was moralization actually due to the hypothesized preventive effects or some other feature of the goods?

# Study 3: Are Non-Contributors Assumed to Always Free Ride?

In some club goods, free riding is possible but difficult to accomplish. For instance, in Study 2, it was possible for noncontributors to use the pier generated by collective action, but it would be socially costly for them to do so. Although this is the realistic case, it creates a potential alternative hypothesis. Perhaps participants' minds treated both public and club goods as if all non-contributors had consumed the collective benefits. If so, this would not be consistent with an assumption of the preventive moralization hypothesis. The preventive moralization hypothesis assumes the mind can encode differences between public and club goods in the likelihood of free riding; this difference, in turn, should cause differences in moralization.

If all non-contributors were treated as free riders, moreover, we might still find the results predicted by the preventive moralization hypothesis without the hypothesis being correct: Perhaps there is greater moralization of free riding on public goods relative to club goods. This could occur, for instance, because public goods are social dilemmas. In social dilemmas, deciding whether to contribute involves making a tradeoff between self-interest and group interest. Perhaps more moralization is required in public goods to motivate others to make this tradeoff in favor of the group.

We test against this alternative by (1) testing whether participants perceive free riding as more likely on public goods (as assumed by the preventive moralization hypothesis) and (2) testing whether there are differences between public and club goods in the moralization of free riding (as predicted by the alternative hypothesis).

## Method and Results

One hundred and three participants read either about a public or a club good (materials from Study 2). Using 5-point scales, they then separately rated the likelihood of contributors and noncontributors consuming the collective benefit (access to fish). The scales indicated frequency of fishing from the side of the river (public good) or from the pier (club good) (anchors were 1 = never, 2 = rarely, 3 = sometimes, 4 = often, and 5 = very often). Whereas there was no difference between public and club goods in the rated likelihood of contributors consuming benefits (both Ms = 4.3, SDPublic = 0.8, SDClub = 1.0), non-contributors on a public good, relative to a club good, were rated as more likely to consume benefits (MPublic = 3.3 vs. MClub = 2.6, SDPublic = 1.1, SDCub = 0.9; independent samples t(101) = 3.7, p < . 001). The greater likelihood of consumption by non-contributors in the public, relative to the club, good is consistent with the assumption of the preventive moralization hypothesis.

Participants also rated separately on 5-point scales the wrongness of contributors and non-contributors consuming collective benefits-with participants explicitly asked to assume that benefits were actually consumed by everyone. (The anchors were 1 = not at all wrong, 2 = a little wrong, 3 = moderately wrong, 4 = very wrong, and 5 = extremely wrong.) There were no moralization differences between public and club goods for contributors (MPublic = 1.3 vs. MClub = 1.4, SDPublic = 0.8, SDClub = 0.7; t(101) = 0.5, p = . 64) or for non-contributors (Mpublic = 3.3 vs. Mclub = 3.0, SDPublic = 0.9, SDClub = 1.2; t(101) = 1.0, p = . 32). Regardless of good type, participants similarly moralized free riding.

Study 3 confirms the preventive moralization assumption: Noncontributors were seen as more likely to consume public good benefits. Study 3 also casts doubt on the alternative hypothesis that the effects of Studies 1 and 2 are due to differences in moralization of free riding in public and club goods (e.g., because public goods are social dilemmas that require a tradeoff of personal for group welfare): When non-contributors were explicitly described as having taken collective benefits, they were equally moralized regardless of the good.

# Study 4: Experimental Public and Club Goods Games

Study 4 sought to conceptually replicate the preventive moralization effect with a substantially different method. Instead of having participants take a third-person perspective and complete consequence-free dependent measures, Study 4 involved participants in real groups, from a first-person perspective, with consequential behavior. To do so, we used experimental economic games with the possibility of consequential moralization: costly punishment of non-contributors.

Although experimental games have the drawback of being relatively abstract and artificial compared to real-world situations, they offer important benefits (for some early relevant examples, see, e.g., Dawes, 1980; Dawes, Mctavish, & Shaklee, 1977; Yamagishi, 1986). First, they use behavioral decisions with monetary consequences. Second, because they use money, decisions can be precisely quantified. Third, game structure can be precisely controlled, guaranteeing that situations are public or club goods games. Indeed, in Study 4 they are ""pure"" public and club goods: It is cost-free to free ride in the public good game and impossible to free ride in the club good game.

All participants played a single public good game and a single club good game, each in a different, anonymous, four-person group. Each game had only a single contribution round and a single punishment round. Given that the games were one-shot and anonymous, economically rational income maximization predicts no punishment in any game because punishment is costly and it cannot affect future payoffs. Thus, if there are differences across goods in punishment, these cannot be due to a rational calculation that differs by good; in other words, if we observe a difference by condition, it cannot be ascribed to this process of domain-general rationality. The games were played for tokens. At the experiment's conclusion a random person from each game could redeem their tokens for cash. Unlike standard games, participants were allowed to redeem as few or as many tokens as they desired. Thus. non-contributors in the public goods game had not (yet) free rode: They did not have to accept cash in exchange for the tokens created by others' contributions.

## Method

Participants. Sixty-five undergracuates (49 women) participated for partial course credit. Some also received money (approximately \$5-\$10) based on their group members' decisions.

Procedure. Each experimental session had 7-10 participants. Each participant was a member of two anonymous, four-person groups, one for the public good game and one for the club good game. For a given participant, their two groups each contained a different random subset of the participants at their session. When the number of participants was not divisible by four, decisions from other participants in the session were used to complete the final group; thus, a participant's decisions might be used in two groups. Participants were not informed whether they or other members of their group had decisions used in multiple groups.

Half the sessions completed the public good game first, the other half the club good game first; the order was randomly determined. Participants learned the rules and made their decisions for one game before moving on to the second. Each game comprised a single contribution round followed by a single punishment round. Only after the entire session did participants learn what other members of their groups chose in either game.

Participants received scripted oral instructions and followed along with their own copy. Participants learned that they would earn tokens based on their own decisions and the decisions of other group members (specifics below). The experimenter quizzed the participants as a group to ensure complete understanding. Participants could not communicate with each other, only with the experimenter. The experimenter would only answer questions about the rules (e.g., questions about the number of tokens earned given a particular set of decisions), not about strategies (e.g., questions about how to maximize earnings). At the end of the session the experimenter randomly selected one person from the club good game and one person from the public good game; these participants could redeem their tokens at a rate of \$0.25 per token. Participants were explicitly informed at the beginning of the session that these people could redeem as many or as few tokens as they desired.

Public good game contribution round. The public good game had a single contribution round (followed by a punishment round). Participants received 10 tokens from the experimenter and chose one of two options: non-contribution {keeping all 10 tokens for themselves) or contribution (transferring all 10 tokens into a group account). If they chose to contribute to the group account, these 10 tokens were multiplied into 28 tckens and divided equally among the group members (a share of 7 for each person). Thus, if only one participant contributed, that participant ended the round with only 7 tokens; the remaining three participar.ts ended the round with 17 tokens (their initial 10 and the 7 from their share of the group account.) If two participants contributed, they each ended the round with 14 tokens (= 7 × 2); the remaining participants each ended the round with 24 tokens (their initial 10 plus 14 created by the contributors). If three participants contributed, they each ended the round with 21 tokens (= 7 × 3): the remaining participant ended the round with 31 tokens (the initial 10 + 21). Finally, if everyone contributed, everyone ended the round with 28 tokens.

Therefore, the game presented a social dilemma: When more people contributed everyone earned more, but it was always payoff maximizing for any individual to net contribute regardless of

others' choices. Note that so long as two people contributed, contributors earned more than their initial 10 tokens: of course. non-contributors earned even more.

Club good game contribution round. The club good game also had a single contribution round (followed by a punishment round). As with the public good game contribution round, participants received 10 tokens and could choose to keep them or to contribute them all to the group account. Unlike the public good game, however, only participants who contributed to the group account received any tokens from the group account. Specifically, every contributor received 7 × n tokens, where n is the number of people who chose to contribute their tokens. Thus, if only one participant contributed, that participant ended the contribution round with 7 tokens (= 7 × 1), and other members of the group ended with their initial 10 tokens. If two participants contributed, each ended the contribution round with 14 tokens (= 7 × 2); the other two members again ended the round with just their initial 10 tokens. Finally, if everyone contributed, everyone ended the contribution round with 28 tokens (= 7 × 4). Thus, the game is a club good: Only contributors received benefits from the group account. As with the public good game, note that so long as two people contributed, contributors earned more than their initial 10 tokens; in the club good game, however, non-contributors always ended the contribution round with just 10 tokens.

In our club good game, contributors always earned seven tokens per contributor regardless of the number of contributors. Thus, a contribution of 10 tokens did not generate a fixed amount of tokens to be shared; the amount generated depended on the number of others contributing. An alternative game structure could have had each contribution of 10 tokens become a fixed, larger number of tokens (e.g., 28); these tokens would then be divided among whoever contributed. In this latter structure, the fewer people who contribute, the more benefits there are for everyone per contribution. Either structure would be consistent with a club good. The club good structure we used in Study 4 has the benefit of keeping the game identical in almost all respects to the public good game. This structure, moreover, follows the logic of a number of club goods important in human sociality, such as coalition prestige, where one member's consumption does not substantially affect another's (Delton & Cimino, 2010).

Punishment and explicit wrongness rating. Both games had a single punishment round. We used a standard technique from experimental economics, the strategy method, for the punishment round. In the standard game method, participants would learn the actual choices their group members made before deciding whether to punish. In the strategy method, however, participants do not learn what their group members did; instead, they commit to a punishment decision for each possible choice their group members could have made. There is some debate about whether the strategy method substantively affects behavior compared to standard game methods (Brandts & Charness, 2000; Brosig, Weimann, & Yang, 2003). The benefit of the strategy method, however, is that it allows much denser data collection. This makes the strategy method useful when researchers are studying responses to low frequency behaviors. For instance, given the structure of the club good game most people are likely to contribute; thus, there would be few opportunities to observe punishment of non-contributors. By using the strategy method, we can learn for every participant whether they would punish non-contributors in both public and club goods.

The punishment round occurred after the contribution round and proceeded as follows: Participants were randomly assigned another member of their group (hereafter the ""target""). They did not learn the target's identity and these assignments were not necessarily reciprocal (i.e., if Person A is assigned to Person B. Person B might be assigned to Person C). Participants were then asked to assume that their target had not contributed. Participants were given 5 additional tokens, and, on the assumption that their target had not contributed, they decided how many tokens to spend on punishment. They could spend any number in whole token increments, including 0. Every 1 token spent on punishment subtracted 2 tokens from their target. If the target had, in fact, not contributed, then the participants' choices were automatically realized: Both players lost money according to the participants' choices. If the target had actually contributed, they were not punished and the participants kept their 5 tokens. Given this design, participants could punish and be punished by at most one other person per game and no one could earn less than zero tokens.

The explicit moral wrongness item was as in previous studies, with appropriate rewording.

#### Results and Discussion

In the public good game, 65% of the sample contributed; in the club good game, all but two participants contributed (of these two, one contributed in the public good game, and the other did not). Because moralization is typically undertaken by contributors, contributors and non-contributors to the public good were analyzed separately. We included in our analyses the two participants who did not contribute to the club good; the results are unchanged if they are excluded. Our analysis strategy for Study 4 was similar to Studies 1 and 2, except we used paired-samples t-tests given the within-subjects design. Given the small number of men, tests involving participant sex would be unreliable. Recall, however, that Studies 1 and 2 showed no interactions involving sex.

Did public goods, relative to club goods, lead to more explicit moralization? Yes: Contributors to the public good explicitly judged non-contribution to be more morally wrong in the public good game than in the club good game, r = . 34, p < . 05 (see Table 3). Interestingly, non-contributors to the public good judged noncontribution to be less morally wrong in the public good game than in the club good game (r = . 47, p < . 05), perhaps attempting to

justify their behavior or out of belief that social dilemmas do not require contribution.

Did public goods, relative to club goods, lead to more costly punishment? Yes: Contributors in the public good game engaged in more costly punishment in the public good game than in the club good game, r = . 41, p < . 01 (see Table 3). This finding conceptually replicates the basic results of Studies 1 and 2 but with consequential behavior. These data support the hypothesis that preventive moralization is due to evolved decision rules and, given the one-shot and anonymous nature of the games, are inconsistent with the alternative hypothesis that preventive moralization is due to rational calculation. Note that costly punishment by noncontributors to the public good was not affected by the type of good (r = . 04).

Were moral wrongness ratings correlated with costly punishment? No, none of the four correlations were significant when disaggregating by public/club good and whether the participant did/did not contribute to the public good, ps > .05, although all were positive (rs ranged from .08 to .37).

#### Study 5: A Nationally Representative Sample

With Study 5, we sought to conceptually replicate the preventive moralization hypothesis with a broader sample. Whereas the previous studies used convenience samples of college students, Study 5 surveyed a nationally representative sample of almost 1,000 U.S. adults.

We also sought to extend the previous results in several ways. First, instead of using experimental manipulation, Study 5 measured perceptions that a good was a public good. Measuring perceptions is important because ultimately it is the interpretation of games, not their objective features, that determine behavior (e.g., Halevy, Chou, & Murnighan, 2012; Kelley et al., 2003; Kelley & Thibaut, 1978; Kiyonari et al., 2000). Second, we sought to test against a potential alternative. Perhaps the mind heuristically associates public goods with greater personal benefits. After all, some of the largest benefits of modern life-clean water. public health, transportation infrastructure-are often organized as public goods. If this association does exist, then perceptions of greater personal benefits-not perceptions of a good being public-may have driven the previous results. This could occur if an expectation of greater personal benefits increases the incentive to moralize and thereby encourage contribution from others. To test against this alternative hypothesis, we examined whether perceptions of a good being public affect moralization when controlling for perceptions of personal benefit. Third, we tested for specificity in the use of preventive moralization. Perceptions of a good being public should drive moralization of non-contributors involved with that particular good; they should not drive moralization of noncontributors more generally. In other words, viewing one collective action to be a public good should not increase moralization of non-contributors involved in other collective actions. To test for this specificity, we contrasted preventive moralization of ingroup non-contributors with moralization of outgroup non-contributors (see also Shinada, Yamagishi, & Ohmura, 2004).

Study 5 asked participants about a hypothetical, upcoming presidential election. We measured their perceptions of how much better off (a) they personally and (b) the nation as a whole would be if their preferred candidate won; the latter measures the degree to which the election is perceived as generating a public good. To assess moralization, we measured their anger at (a) an ingroup non-contributor and at (b) an outgroup non-contributor. Noncontribution was operationalized as neither voting nor spending any time or energy to get the non-contributor's preferred candidate elected. The ingroup member's preferred candidate was the same as the participant's; the outgroup member's was an opponent of the participant's. As before, the collective action had not been completed: No election had yet taken place, and thus benefit consumption was not possible. The preventive moralization hypothesis predicts that, when controlling for perceptions of personal benefit, perceptions of national benefit should independently predict anger at an ingroup non-contributor; moreover, perceptions of national benefits for the participant's candidate winning should not predict anger at an outgroup non-contributor.

## Method

Participants and data collection. Nine hundred twenty-three people responded over the Internet. The survey was administered by Time-Sharing Experiments in the Social Sciences (www.tess experiments.org). Technical aspects and participant recruiting were handled by Knowledge Networks (www.knowledgenet works.com/ganp). The present data are part of a larger project; for a fuller project description and details of Knowledge Networks methods, see www.tessexperiments.org/data/delton363.html. Data from 32 additional participants were excluded because they did not answer >50% of the 13 questions composing our larger survey.

Fifty percent of the sample was women. Based on the categories provided by Knowledge Networks, the ethnic/racial breakdown was as follows: 77% white, 9% black, 9% Hispanic, 2% two or more races, 3% other. The modal education was high school graduate or equivalent (29%), followed closely by some college or bachelor's degree (23% and 22%, respectively). Average age was 47 years (SD = 16). Average income was approximately \$38,000/ year (ranging from approximately \$5,000 to \$175,000). Seventy percent belonged to a political party; the rest were independents.

Materials and measures. Participants were asked to imagine an upcoming, hypothetical presidential election. The current president did not share the participants' views. Because of these diverging views, participants and people who held similar opinions as the participants' were ""worried and angry"" and wanted ""to win back control of the White House."" All questions used scales ranging from 0 to 100, with anchors at 0, 50, and 100, and

responses allowed in multiples of 5. Personal benefit: ""How much better off would you personally expect to be if your candidate is elected and his opponent is defeated?"" National benefit: ""How much better off would you expect the nation as a whole to be if your candidate is elected and his opponent is defeated?"" (Anchors for both were as follows: not at all better off, moderately better off, very much better off.) Anger at ingroup and outgroup non-contributors: This voter ""did not spend any time, effort, or money"" trying to get their (the voter's) preferred candidate elected and ""did not even bother to go out and vote ... how angry would you feel towards [him/her]?"" (Anchors were as follows: not at all angry, moderately angry, very angry.) The elided parts described how the participants and the voters were members of the same or different political parties (if the participant belonged to a political party) or were of the same or different political views (if the participant was an independent). Ingroup non-contributors supported the same candidate as the participant; outgroup non-contributors an opposing candidate. The non-contributors' sex was randomized.3

Analysis strategy. Approximately 3% of responses were missing across the two items measuring anger and the two items measuring perceptions of benefits. To analyze the data despite these missing values, we used Amos statistical software (Arbuckle, 2010). Amos is a structural equation modeling program that uses maximum likelihood methods. These methods allow the estimation of parameters even with incomplete data. All analyses use the demographic variables described above as covariates. We allowed covariates and predictors to freely covary with each other; when a model had multiple dependent measures, we allowed their residual variances to freely covary. To test whether regression weights differed from each other, we used x2 tests on nested models (Kline, 2010): In the initial model, each of the two focal weights was allowed to have a unique estimate; in a second model, the focal weights were constrained to have identical estimates. A significant x2 test would show that the second model fits the data more poorly and that separate parameters are required; in other words, a significant test shows that the focal weights are not identical.

## Results and Discussion

Did perceptions of a good being public predict preventive moralization? Yes. Based on a maximum likelihood analysis, the more that participants viewed the election of their candidate as a national benefit, the more angry they were at an ingroup noncontributor (standardized regression weight = . 26, p < . 001). Studies 1-4 showed that experimental manipulations of a good being public (vs. club) led to moralization; the present result shows that participants' quantitative perceptions of a good being public, not just experimental manipulation, also predicted greater moralization.

Did perceptions of a good being public continue to predict moralization when expected personal benefit was controlled? Yes, when personal benefit was also included in the analysis, personal and national benefit both independently predicted anger at an ingroup non-contributor (standardized regression weights =

<sup>3</sup> Although beyond the scope of this article, the survey manipulated the likelihood that the participants' preferred candidate would win and whether the hypothetical voters expected a large or small benefit if their preferred candidate won. These variables were also used as covariates.
.23 and .11, respectively; ps < . 05). Note that the correlation between personal and national benefit is .70. Thus, although the standardized regression weights are not large, we think it is telling that both variables had independent effects on anger despite their high correlation with each other. Perceptions of a good being public, over and above perceptions of personal benefit, predicted greater moralization. This result suggests that, even if there is a heuristic association between public goods and greater personal benefits, this potential association cannot explain the totality of our results

Was preventive moralization absent for outgroup non-contributors? Yes. To test for the absence of an effect for outgroup non-contributors, we created a maximum likelihood model that contained (a) anger at an ingroup member and anger at an outgroup member as dependent measures and (b) personal and national benefits as predictors. The preventive moralization hypothesis predicts a larger effect of national benefits on anger toward an ingroup non-contributor relative to anger at an outgroup non-contributor; this was true, x2(1) = 8.03, p < . 01. Indeed, national benefit did not predict anger toward outgroup noncontributors whatsoever, even after controlling for personal benefits (ß = -. 02, p = . 70). The lack of an effect is especially striking given that members of the outgroup are likely to perceive their candidate's election to be a public good. Importantly, however, it was a separate collective action from the one generating participants' perceptions. Perceptions of whether a good is public seem to drive moralization of non-contributors involved with that good. but not moralization of non-contributors generally.

# Studies 6-9: Quantitatively Manipulating Likelihood of Future Free Riding

Studies 1-5 were designed to provide initial confirmatory support for the preventive moralization hypothesis and to rule out a series of related alternative hypotheses, including alternatives based on labor recruitment, group conformity and related constructs, and rational income maximization. We designed Studies 6-9 to address two additional issues. These studies encompassed a diverse sample of almost 700 U.S. adults.

Our first goal with Studies 6-9 was to provide evidence for the process predicted by the preventive moralization hypothesis. The preventive moralization hypothesis proposes that one source of moralization is the possibility that a person who merely opts out may become a free rider in the future. Thus, preventive moralization should be mediated by perceptions of the likelihood of free riding (see Figure 1). Although we cannot test this mediation hypothesis directly (because we cannot directly manipulate the internal perception of likelihood of free riding), in Studies 6-9 we can test for statistical mediation that is at least consistent with this causal model

A second goal was to empirically examine a wider range of likelihoods to free ride. Studies 1-4 used stark contrasts: Free riding was trivially easy and highly likely in the public goods and virtually impossible in the club goods. In Studies 6-9, we quantitatively manipulated the likelihood of free riding through five levels. This allowed us to test whether preventive moralization occurs outside of cases where free riding is all but guaranteed. It also allowed us to test whether preventive moralization is a simple all-or-none phenomenon or whether it quantitatively tracks the likelihood of free riding.

Our third goal was to explore a variety of potential cues that could serve as input to perceptions of the likelihood of free riding (i.e., possible inputs in the leftmost box of Figure 1). Each study manipulated a different possible cue to the likelihood of free riding: non-contributors' subjective valuation of the good, noncontributors' cost if they free rode, the ability of contributors to monitor the good and prevent free riding, and the benefits noncontributors can obtain if they do free ride.

## Method

Participants. Six hundred sixty-eight people participated (280 were female). Average age was 30 years (SD = 10). Average income was approximately \$33,000/year (ranging from approximately \$15,000 to \$150,000). Participants were randomly assigned to experiments and to conditions within experiments.

To recruit participants, we used the Mechanical Turk platform, a subsidiary of Amazon.com. Participants were paid between \$0.10 and \$0.20, consistent with standard rates on Mechanical Turk for a survey this length. Mechanical Turk has recently emerged as a promising tool for the behavioral sciences, allowing data collection in surveys or simple economic games from a diverse sample of participants (Buhrmester, Kwang, & Gosling, 2011). Although Mechanical Turk does not guarantee a nationally representative sample (as in our Study 5), it does allow us to test predictions using a broader pool than psychology undergraduates.

Materials. In all four studies, participants were asked to imagine that they were members of a gardening co-op. They read that: ""Every year, the owners of the co-op organize a 'bag drive.' Co-op members who are willing each contribute \$300 to fund the purchase of high quality fertilizer that can be used throughout the year. The bags of fertilizer will be delivered approximately two weeks from today."" Thus, free riding was not yet possible because no benefits were available to take.

Cooperation was synergistic: ""The greater the number of members who contribute, the cheaper it is to buy the fertilizer in bulk. In other words, the more people who contribute, the more fertilizer there is for each member of the co-op.""

Next, they read that the bags would be stored in a common area that everyone had access to. Thus, even non-contributors could free ride by taking bags.

Co-op members were described as having received a form where they could mark whether they opted in to the bag drive. On this form, members also rated their perceptions of the usefulness of the fertilizer from 0 (not useful at all) to 10 (extremely). Co-op members who opted in were described as choosing 10 on average; participants were asked to assume they opted in and rated the usefulness as 10. Ratings by the target who opted out served as the manipulation in Study 6; in Studies 7-9, the target who opted out always also chose 10.

Participants in all studies read about a member, Alan, who opted out of the bag drive. Further details about Alan or the actions available to him differed by study.

Study 6: Subjective valuation. Participants in this study learned how Alan rated the usefulness of the bags from 0 (not at all useful) to 10 (extremely useful). His ratings differed by condition: 0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, or 10. Because participants were asked to assume they rated the bags at 10, Alan therefore rated them as 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100% as useful as participants did.

Study 7: Cost. Participants in this study learned that the co-op had several tracts of land. Alan gardened at and lived very near one of their locations, but the bags would be stored at a different location. The drive to get to the location with the bags varied by condition: 5 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 2 hr, or 4 hr.

Study 8: Monitoring. Participants in this study learned that volunteers staffed the common area to monitor whether people trying to take bags had actually contributed. The percentage of time there were volunteers available varied by condition: 100%, 75%, 50%, 25%, or 0% of the time.

Study 9: Benefits. Participants in this study learned that: ""At the insistence of the co-op owners, and despite objections from some of the members who contributed, everyone who wants fertilizer can come and get bags of fertilizer if they choose."" Those who contributed would get approximately 100 bags (the specific number depending on how many people ultimately contributed). The number of bags available to non-contributors varied by condition: about 100 bags, 75 bags, 50 bags, 25 bags, or 1 bag.

Measures. Participants answered three dependent measures, each on 7-point scales. To measure perceptions of the likelihood of free riding, participants were asked the following: ""How likely is Alan to take some fertilizer despite not contributing to the fertilizer drive?"" (1 = not at all likely, 7 = very likely). To measure moralization, they were asked two questions: ""How morally wrong is it that Alan did not contribute to the fertilizer drive?"" (1 = not at all wrong, 7 = very wrong), and ""How angry are you at Alan?"" (1 = not at all angry, 7 = very angry). Finally, participants answered demographic questions about age, income, and sex.

Analysis strategy. Our primary question was whether within each study there was an indirect statistical effect of our manipulation (valuation, cost, monitoring, or benefits) on preventive moralization (moral wrongness and anger) through perceived likelihood of free riding. To test for this effect, we used a bootstrapping approach to statistical mediation and indirect effects (Preacher & Hayes, 2008). The experimental manipulations were coded 1 through 5; they were always ordered so that 1 was the condition predicted to be least likely to induce free riding, and 5 was the condition predicted to be most likely to induce free riding. We report estimates of the bootstrapped indirect effects and their bias-corrected and accelerated 95% confidence intervals. If the estimate is positive and the confidence intervals do not include zero, then the data indicate significant support for an indirect effect. All bootstrapping analyses used 20,000 bootstrap samples and age, income, and sex as covariates. Estimates are reported in their raw metric. For instance, an indirect effect of .5 means that a one unit increase in the independent variable (e.g., subjective valuation) will cause a half-unit increase in ratings of moralization (e.g., anger) as mediated by perceived likelihood of free riding. We emphasize that inferences about causal mediation are necessarily indirect. Although we manipulated cues to future free riding, we were only able to measure moralization and perceptions of future free riding. Thus, our results can only speak directly to statistical mediation.

### Results

Study 6: Valuation-Does perceived likelihood of free riding statistically mediate the relationship between a noncontributor's valuation of the good and moralization of that non-contributor? Yes, there were significant indirect effects of the manipulation of fertilizer valuation on both moral wrongness and anger, and these indirect effects were statistically mediated by perceptions of the likelihood of free riding. For moral wrongness, the bootstrapped indirect effect estimate was .39 with a 95% confidence interval from .24 to .57. For anger, the bootstrapped indirect effect estimate was .41 with a 95% confidence interval from .26 to .57. Neither confidence interval includes zero, which supports the hypotheses that the manipulation of valuation would lead to preventive moralization and that such effects would be statistically mediated by the perceived likelihood of free riding.

We also conducted additional regression analyses to probe the components of this indirect effect; these analyses used the same covariates as the bootstrapping analyses. First, these analyses showed that manipulation of valuation had a significant impact on the mediator, the perceived likelihood of free riding (estimate = .58, p < . 001). The mediator of perceived likelihood, moreover, significantly predicted both moral wrongness and anger (estimates = .68 and .70, ps < . 001). With the mediator not in the model, manipulation of fertilizer valuation had a significant total effect on both moral wrongness and anger (estimates = . 48 and .44, respectively; ps < . 001). With the mediator included, the effects of valuation on both wrongness and anger were no longer significant (estimates = . 08 and .03. ps > .4). These analyses reinforce the bootstrapping results and additionally show that the mediator statistically accounts almost entirely for the correlations between valuation and preventive moralization.

Study 7: Costs-Does the perceived likelihood of free riding statistically mediate the relationship between costs of future free riding and moralization of a potential free rider? Yes, there were significant indirect effects of the manipulation of costs on both moral wrongness and anger and these indirect effects were statistically mediated by perceptions of the likelihood of free riding. For moral wrongness, the bootstrapped indirect effect estimate was .19 with a 95% confidence interval from .09 to .33. For anger, the bootstrapped indirect effect estimate was .19 with a 95% confidence interval from .09 to .32. Neither confidence interval includes zero, supporting the hypotheses that manipulations of cost would lead to preventive moralization and that such effects would be statistically mediated by the perceived likelihood of free riding.

Additional regression analyses showed that the manipulation of costs had a significant impact on the mediator, the perceived likelihood of free riding (estimate = . 33, p < . 001). The mediator of perceived likelihood, moreover, significantly predicted both moral wrongness and anger (estimates = . 58 and .56, ps < . 001). With the mediator not in the model, manipulations of cost had a significant total effect on both moral wrongness and anger (estimates = . 30 and .32, respectively; ps < . 01). With the mediator included, the effects of cost on both wrongness and anger were no longer significant (estimates = . 11 and . 13, ps > . 15). These analyses reinforce the bootstrapping results and additionally show

that the mediator statistically accounts almost entirely for the correlations between valuation and the measures of moralization.

Study 8: Monitoring-Does perceived likelihood of free riding statistically mediate the relationship between the availability of monitoring and moralization of a potential free rider? Yes, there were significant indirect effects of the manipulation of monitoring on both moral wrongness and anger and these indirect effects were statistically mediated by the perceived likelihood of free riding. For moral wrongness, the bootstrapped indirect effect estimate was .14 with a 95% confidence interval from .03 to .27. For anger, the bootstrapped indirect effect estimate was .14 with a 95% confidence interval from .03 to .26. Neither confidence interval includes zero, supporting the hypotheses that the manipulation of monitoring would lead to preventive moralization and that such effects would be statistically mediated by the perceived likelihood of free riding.

Additional regression analyses showed that manipulations of monitoring availability had a significant impact on the mediator, the perceived likelihood of free riding (estimate = . 26, p < . 01). The mediator of perceived likelihood, moreover, significantly predicted both moral wrongness and anger (estimates = . 55 and .53, respectively; ps < . 001). With the mediator not in the model, the manipulation of monitoring did not have a significant total effect on either moral wrongness or anger (estimates = . 05 and . 17, respectively; ps > .14). With the mediator included, the effects of monitoring on both wrongness and anger were even smaller or descriptively in the wrong direction (estimates = -. 09 and . 03, respectively; ps > .4). Some approaches to statistical mediation require that there be a significant total effect (i.e., when the mediator is removed from the model) as a preliminary condition for testing mediation, other approaches view a significant indirect effect as most probative (Preacher & Hayes, 2008; Shrout & Bolger, 2002). Although our results do not meet the former, more stringent version of mediation, we believe the results of Study 8 are mostly supportive of the hypothesis: There is a significant causal effect of manipulations in the independent variable on the mediator, there are significant correlations of the mediator with the dependent variables, and there are significant statistical indirect effects of the independent variable on the dependent variables through the mediator.

Again we note that inferences about causal mediation in Studies 6-8 are indirect. Both the mediator and the dependent variable were merely measured, not manipulated. Thus, we can only provide direct evidence for statistical mediation that is consistent with the causal model in Figure 1.

Study 9: Benefits-Does perceived likelihood of free riding statistically mediate the relationship between the size of the benefits available to free riders and moralization of a potential free rider? No, the indirect effects were small for both moral wrongness and anger, and both confidence intervals included zero (estimates of both = -. 02; 95% CIs [-. 08, .02] and [-. 1, . 03], respectively). Regression analyses revealed no effects involving the manipulation of benefits (all ps > .2).

One reason for these null results may be ceiling effects. As shown in Tables 4, 5, and 6, the means of perceived likelihood of free riding, moral wrongness, and anger were are all higher in Study 9 compared to the other three studies. The measure of likelihood was especially high, with means approaching the scale maximum of 7. Collapsing across condition and based on a series of independent t-tests, all three measures in Study 9 received higher ratings than any other study (for all nine comparisons, ps < . 001). Comparing Studies 6-8 against each other revealed essentially no differences (eight of nine ps > .15; one comparison had p = . 011). Although Study 9's data do not support the hypothesis of statistical mediation, we think Study 9 does illustrate just how strongly preventive moralization can operate. Consider that a free rider who is caught is likely to face sanctioning and reputational damage. In one condition of Study 9, free riders could only gain a single bag of fertilizer-little gain for potentially large negative repercussions. Yet, participants believed a non-contributor in this situation was nonetheless very likely to free ride, rating the likelihood an average of 6.3 out of 7; preventive moralization was acting quite strongly even in a case where free riding might be objectively unlikely.

Finally, note that in Study 9 as in the Studies 6-8, the perceived likelihood of free riding predicted both moral wrongness and anger (estimates = . 38 and .49, respectively; ps < . 01). Thus, despite the experimental manipulation failing in this study, the correlational data still show the pattern predicted by the preventive moralization hypothesis: greater perceived likelihood of free riding is associated with greater moralization.

Does preventive moralization occur only when free riding is virtually guaranteed? One could argue that although preventive moralization is a real phenomenon, it is not robust. Perhaps preventive moralization only occurs when free riding is virtually guaranteed. For instance, in Studies 1-4, one might expect that

Means (Standard Deviations) of Ratings of Moral Wrongness of Opting Out of a Public Good (Studies 6-9)

people opting out would almost certainly consume the benefits. If preventive moralization only occurs in these limiting cases, then it would have little relevance in explaining real world behavior. Studies 6-9 were designed to test against this alternative by manipulating the likelihood of free riding quantitatively, rather than using the dichotomous contrasts of Studies 1-4.

One way to examine this is to use the unintended difference between Study 9 and Studies 6-8. Although Study 9 did not show any effects of our experimental manipulation, compared to Studies 6-8, Study 9's ratings of the likelihood of free riding and ratings of anger and wrongness were uniformly high (see results above). The ratings for likelihood of free riding were especially high compared to the other studies, suggesting that, at least for Studies 6-8, participants did not view the potential free rider as guaranteed to free ride. Nonetheless, in Studies 6-8 participants did engage in preventive moralization.

Because Study 9 did not show any effects of the manipulation, we further focus only on Studies 6-8. First, note that descriptively most measures of likelihood, moral wrongness, and anger tended to increase as the level of the cue increased (however, this increase was not perfectly monotonic: see Tables 4-6). Second, to formally test that preventive moralization occurs outside the boundary case of guaranteed free riding, we tested whether there were linear effects of our manipulations on measures of likelihood, wrongness, and anger even when excluding the condition within each study most likely to induce free riding. Of these nine tests, seven were significant or marginally so (for those seven, ps ≤ . 063). The only two that did not show an effect were anger and wrongness in Study 8 (ps > . 12); recall that this study showed no effects on these variables even if all levels of the independent variable were included. Thus, whenever our manipulation was successful, it was successful even outside the narrow case of a condition most likely to induce free riding.

### General Discussion

The social mind is not unitary but encompasses multiple domains, each with their own proprietary logic and decision rules (Bugental, 2000; Fiske, 1992; Kenrick et al., 2003, 2010). One important domain of human sociality is collective action: multiple people working together to produce a shared benefit. One important set of decision rules for collective action are those that regulate moralization. Because moralization decisions are inherently uncertain, we applied the logic of error management (Haselton et al., 2009; Haselton & Nettle, 2006) to develop the preventive moralization hypothesis: merely opting out of helping to create a public good can make that person a target of moralization because that person might (but also might not) free ride in the future.

Across nine studies, using diverse methods and measures and including a nationally representative sample of almost 1,000 U.S. adults, we showed that non-contributors to public goods were preventively moralized. Despite not actively taking any benefits, their behavior was viewed as morally wrong (Studies 1-4, 6-9), they were targets of anger (Studies 5-9), they were implicitly associated with negative moral traits (Studies 1-2), and they were punished (Study 4). In other words, they were treated as free riders despite not free riding-they were preventively moralized. Moreover, preventive moralization correlated with perceptions that a

non-contributor was likely to free ride (Studies 6-9), perceptions of the likelihood of free riding were quantitatively modulated by a variety of cues (Studies 6-8), and the effect of these cues on moralization was statistically mediated by perceptions of the likelihood of free riding (Studies 6-8). Preventive moralization was also a robust phenomenon, appearing even in cases where free riding was not certain (Studies 6-9).

Preventive moralization did not occur because moralization creates more labor, thereby producing more benefits-the potential to create labor was held constant across public and club goods (Studies 1-3 and especially Study 4). It was not because the social dilemma of public goods elicits more moralization or because non-contributors are confused with people who have illicitly taken benefits (Study 3). It was not because moralization can be rationally calculated to be more useful in public goods (Study 4). It was not because the mind heuristically associates public goods with greater personal benefits (Study 5). And it was not because noncontributors could objectively be viewed as selfish or deviant (Studies 1-4). Instead, preventive moralization appears tailored to solve the problem of whether to moralize non-contributors now on the chance they become free riders in the future.

# Future Directions

It remains for future research to examine how moralization of people who simply opt out compares to moralization of people who have actually taken collective benefits. The preventive moralization hypothesis does not make any strong predictions here. Free riders could receive equal moralization, more moralization, or even less moralization than those who simply opt out. Although we think the latter is unlikely, there may be situations where moralizing already-completed free riding has little utility. Instead, moralizing people who might still contribute could have larger associated gains.

Future research could also further delve into the hypothesis that preventive moralization is a product of design for error management. Generally, an error management framework predicts that decision making should sometimes be ""biased"" away from objectively correct responding and thereby respond more adaptively (e.g., even if 99% of the time foliage does not hide a predator, the mind might respond as if it usually does). Our studies examined one aspect of ""bias"" in moralization. Most people would report that others should not be sanctioned for a wrong they have not committed. Yet, contra this normative stance, our studies showed that people explicitly and implicitly sanctioned others simply for opting out, despite those others not illicitly taking benefits. A logically separable error management effect could proceed from the fact that only some people who opt out will eventually take benefits illicitly. Are people who merely opt out moralized out of proportion to the number of people who would eventually take benefits illicitly? This could be tested by an experiment comparing punishment of free riders-a situation where punishers know who has actually taken benefits-to punishment of people who merely opt out-a situation with uncertainty regarding who will take benefits. If there is more punishment in the latter condition, this would suggest the operation of an error management strategy, a strategy that serves to catch all people who will eventually free ride even if not all actually do free ride.

Although Studies 6-9 were designed to examine potential mediators of preventive moralization, another topic for future research is to examine potential moderators. One potential moderator is the number of moralizers available. Evolutionary modeling work shows that moralization is easier to sustain when multiple parties coordinate to do it (Boyd, Gintis, & Bowles, 2010), and ethnographic research shows that moralization is more likely with coordination (Boehm, 1993). A second potential moderator is social or physical power. People with greater power are more likely to be able to successfully implement moralization and so might be more likely to engage in it (Maner & Mead, 2010; Sell, Tooby, & Cosmides, 2009). A third potential moderator is the nature of the relationship between the potential moralizer and the person being moralized. When a relationship is likely to continue into the future, it may be more beneficial to change the behavior of a person who opts out and encourage them to cooperate in the future (Krasnow, Cosmides, Pedersen, & Tooby, 2012).

# Implicit and Explicit Responses to Non-Contributors

Throughout this article, we have relied on a multi-method approach using implicit, explicit, and behavioral measures. Generally, these measures failed to significantly correlate with each other, although the direction of correlation was usually positive. Implicit and explicit items often have moderate correlations (see meta-analysis by Hofmann, Gawronski, Gschwendner, Le, & Schmitt, 2005). What might explain these effects in our studies? One possibility is that different measures tap mechanisms with somewhat different functions, leading to weak associations (Cushman, 2008; Lieberman & Linke, 2007). A related possibility is that moral judgments are produced by multiple intuitive systems. This possibility is consistent with theoretical proposals suggesting that social and moral decision making is underwritten by a number of subsystems, many designed to deliver inferences in different domains (Haidt, 2007; Lieberman, Tooby, & Cosmides, 2003; Tooby & Cosmides, 2010; Tybur et al., 2009), some of which may be unrelated to moral judgment per se (DeScioli & Kurzban, 2009, 2013). The relative weighting of different inference engines, moreover, may vary across time, space, and context (Cohen & Rozin, 2001; Graham, Haidt, & Nosek, 2009; Yamagishi, Hashimoto, & Schug, 2008). In some cases, one's moral intuitions may have little or no causal relationship with consciously reasoned moral judgments (Haidt, 2001). In recent work, for example, men's upper body strength (one cause of interpersonal competitive success during human evolution; Sell, Hone, & Pound, 2012) predicted attitudes about the acceptability of force in international conflict and about public policy regarding redistribution-despite the impossibility of personal strength having any meaningful impact on these issues (Petersen, Sznycer, Sell, Tooby, & Cosmides, in press: Sell et al., 2009).

Another possibility is that explicit declarations of wrongness may function to recruit others to moralize non-contributors and implicit judgments may function as personal assessments to avoid a non-contributor in the future. The extent to which these correlate may vary by a person's social power (see above) or general agreeableness. Thus, our explicit measure might be tapping mechanisms involved with changing others' behavior and our implicit measure might be tapping mechanisms involved with changing one's own behavior.

The possible disconnect between explicit, implicit, and behavioral measures of costly punishment also relates to an issue raised in the introduction. In some cases, there can be substantial costs to preventive moralization. Moralizing a long-term associate for a single instance of opting out might destroy an otherwise profitable relationship. Indeed, it might even invite costly retaliation (Nikiforakis, 2008). On the other hand, moralizing within low stakes relationships (such as with recently met strangers) has fewer costs; even if the relationship ends, little is lost (Sznycer et al., 2012). In cases involving close others and little opting out, the primary moralization response might be internal, simply registering that steps may need to be taken in the future should the behavior continue. Alternatively, moralization might consist of avoidance or subtle exclusion instead of outright punishment. In this way the moralizer avoids being free ridden on without inviting retaliation. Overt, costly punishment might only be used when the stakes are low (such as our Study 4), when there is a consistent pattern of opting out, or when many people can be coordinated to punish and lessen the chance of costly retaliation.

#### The Social Cognition of Cooperation and Coalitions

This research adds to a growing literature on the evolutionary social cognition of cooperation and coalitions (Kurzban & Neuberg, 2005). Past work has, for example, investigated dedicated machinery for detecting alliances (Cosmides, Tooby, & Kurzban, 2003; Kurzban, Tooby, & Cosmides, 2001), for engaging in leader-follower relationships (Van Vugt, Hogan, & Kaiser, 2008), for integrating new members into enduring coalitions (Cimino & Delton, 2010; Delton & Cimino, 2010), and for managing intergroup relationships (Ackerman et al., 2006; McDonald et al., 2012; Miller, Maner, & Becker, 2010).

Intense focus has been placed on characterizing mechanisms for detecting free riders and for responding to them with punishment or other sanctions (e.g., Delton et al., 2012; Kiyonari & Barclay, 2008; Lieberman & Linke, 2007; Price, 2005; Price et al., 2002; Shinada & Yamagishi, 2007; Shinada et al., 2004; Tooby et al., 2006). One open question is whether there are distinct functions served by second-party sanctioning (sanctioning by a directly affected party) and third-party sanctioning (sanctioning by an apparently disinterested observer; see DeScioli & Kurzban, 2009, 2013). Whereas second-party sanctioning is widely thought to be targeted at changing an offender's behavior (McCullough et al., 2013), third-party sanctioning might be designed, in part, as a signal to others (Kurzban, DeScioli, & O'Brien, 2007). Our results have the potential to blur this distinction: In one sense, people who preventively moralize have not had their labor exploited; thus, they are engaging in third-party sanctioning because they have not been directly affected. In another sense, on the preventive moralization hypothesis, their minds act as if or implicitly assume that someone who opts out has exploited collective benefits, activating anti-free rider responses: thus. the design of the mechanism is a design for second-party sanctioning.

Finally, we note that differing intuitions about preventive moralization have the potential to create political and moral disagreement (cf. Haidt & Graham, 2007). For example, some may view a given collective action as producing a public good-a benefit to everyone in the community-while others may view it as a net drain-a waste of everyone's time and energy. Those who believe a public good is being produced may become angry and sanction the uninterested-quite rightfully from their perspective. Yet, the uninterested may view the other side as illicitly forcing their labor or resources-again, rightfully from their perspective. Thus, a reasonable difference of opinion about the nature of a good can become a moral or political battleground (Tooby & Cosmides, 2010). Moreover, by framing goods as public goods or club goods, people might strategically attempt to bring support to favored projects and prevent the completion of disfavored projects. Such disagreements and strategic framing might play a role in political polarization.

### Conclusion

Humans cooperate, are altruistic, and give generously to others. Such achievements are often contrasted with less vaunted aspects of human nature, such as homicide and warfare. But cooperation requires vigilance and, sometimes, anger and punishment. However, the mind does not only moralize people who commit a clear wrong-sometimes the mind moralizes non-contributors who have taken no benefits at all.

155,26524001,"# Closing Achievement Gaps With a Utility-Value Intervention: Disentangling Race and Social Class

> Many college students abandon their goal of completing a degree in science, technology, engineering, or math (STEM) when confronted with challenging introductory-level science courses. In the U.S., this trend is more pronounced for underrepresented minority (URM) and first-generation (FG) students, and contributes to persisting racial and social-class achievement gaps in higher education. Previous intervention studies have focused exclusively on race or social class, but have not examined how the 2 may be confounded and interact. This research therefore investigates the independent and interactive effects of race and social class as moderators of an intervention designed to promote performance, measured by grade in the course. In a double-blind randomized experiment conducted over 4 semesters of an introductory biology course (N = 1,040), we tested the effectiveness of a utility-value intervention in which students wrote about the personal relevance of course material. The utility-value intervention was successful in reducing the achievement gap for FG-URM students by 61%: the performance gap for FG-URM students, relative to continuing generation (CG)-Majority students, was large in the control condition, .84 grade points (d = .98), and the treatment effect for FG-URM students was .51 grade points (d = 0.55). The UV intervention helped students from all groups find utility value in the course content, and mediation analyses showed that the process of writing about utility value was particularly powerful for FG-URM students. Results highlight the importance of intersectionality in examining the independent and interactive effects of race and social class when evaluating interventions to close achievement gaps and the mechanisms through which they may operate.

Many students start college intending to pursue a career in science, technology, engineering, or math (STEM), but too many abandon this goal after introductory courses, either because they perform poorly, lose interest, feel uncomfortable in the course, or

some combination thereof. Some groups are at greater risk for these problems. For example, African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans together constitute 26% of the U.S. population, but only 9% of STEM professionals, and 11% of STEM degree recipients in 2008 (National Science Board, 2012). Another group that struggles in college is first-generation (FG) students, those for whom neither parent obtained a 4-year college degree, compared with continuing-generation (CG) students, who have at least one parent with a 4-year degree. FG students constitute roughly 20% of students in American universities and represent a potentially large STEM talent pool, yet they drop out of college at a higher rate (28%-35%) than CG students (17%; Chen, 2005; Radford, Berkner, Wheeless, & Shepherd, 2010). If we wish to increase the number of students in science and maximize the chances of discovering talent, it is critically important to promote motivation and performance for underrepresented ethnic minority (URM) and FG students in introductory science courses, which act as a gateway to STEM careers (Ferrini-Mundy, 2013).

Differences in academic performance between URM and majority students are referred to as racial achievement gaps, whereas differences between FG and CG students are referred to as the social-class achievement gap, because parental education is a proxy for socioeconomic status (Fiske & Markus, 2012; Jackman & Jackman, 1983; Pascarella & Terenzini, 1991; Snibbe & Markus, 2005). These achievement gaps can be attributed to a number of economic and social factors such as poverty, quality of schools, economic resources, and academic preparation (Bowen, Kurzweil, & Tobin, 2005; Pascarella & Terenzini, 1991), but they

may also reflect psychological factors to the extent that FG and URM students feel less engaged in their classes, feel stigmatized, or worry about whether they belong in the course or at the university (Johnson, Richeson, & Finkel, 2011; Ostrove & Long, 2007).

#### Brief Interventions

In recent years a number of social-psychological interventions have been developed to help at-risk students in introductory college classes, with striking effects (Yeager & Walton, 2011). These brief interventions are powerful because they are psychologically precise and focus on a specific problem (e.g., identity threat, disengagement) at critical time points (e.g., freshman orientation, gateway courses; Walton, 2014). Some interventions, such as the values affirmation and belonging interventions (Cohen, Garcia, Apfel, & Master, 2006; Walton & Cohen, 2011) are domaingeneral, and focus on students' self-beliefs and sense of belonging in college. Others, such as the utility-value intervention (Hulleman & Harackiewicz, 2009), are domain-specific and address factors such as task values or interest in a particular course. These interventions have been used to help different groups of students. Some interventions focus on students with a history of poor performance (Hulleman, Godes, Hendricks, & Harackiewicz, 2010), whereas others have targeted either racial gaps (e.g., Cohen et al., 2006; Sherman et al., 2013; Walton & Cohen, 2011) or social class gaps in academic achievement (e.g., Harackiewicz, Canning et al., 2014; Stephens, Hamedani, & Destin, 2014).

In this research, we tested two brief writing interventions hypothesized to help underrepresented students in an introductory college biology course: the values affirmation (VA) and utilityvalue (UV) interventions, which work at different levels of domain specificity and address different problems. The VA intervention targets one obstacle to student achievement, namely, identity threat. Students can feel threatened when they are aware of stereotypes about their group or worry about whether they ""fit in"" at college, and this can undermine their performance (Cohen, Purdie-Vaughns, & Garcia, 2012; Ostrove & Long, 2007; Stephens, Fryberg, Markus, Johnson, & Covarrubias, 2012). When individuals affirm their personal values in a threatening environment, however, they can reestablish a perception of personal integrity and worth (Cohen & Sherman, 2014). For example, Cohen, Garcia, Apfel, and Master (2006) found that a brief writing exercise in which students reflected on their core personal values reduced the gap in grades between African American and European American students by almost 40%. More recently, Harackiewicz, Canning et al. (2014) found that the same VA technique worked to close the social-class achievement gap in college biology. In contrast, the UV intervention has not previously been tested with respect to racial or social class gaps, but has been shown to help students with a history of poor performance achieve higher grades in their classes (Harackiewicz & Hulleman, 2010).

#### Utility-Value Interventions

The UV intervention targets different psychological processes critical to student achievement: perceived value of and engagement in coursework. It is a curricular intervention in which students write short essays about the personal relevance of course

material. For example, a student might write an essay about how what she learned about animal physiology informs her future workout plans, explaining the basic principles of muscle potential and relating them to her life. These course assignments help students discover connections between course topics and their lives. The intervention is based in expectancy-value theory (Eccles & Wigfield, 2002), which argues that individuals choose to take on challenging tasks-such as declaring a STEM major or persisting in a difficult biology course-if they (a) value the task, and (b) expect that they can succeed at the task (based on self-beliefs). Beliefs about the self (e.g., ""I am very good at science"") and beliefs about the value of the task (e.g., ""Biology is an important field"") are both critically important in predicting academic motivation. However, it may be more feasible to influence students' subjective task values than their expectations for success (Pajares, 1996). Eccles (2009; Eccles et al., 1983) identified four types of subjective task values: intrinsic value, the perceived importance of a task because of its inherent enjoyment or interest; attainment value, the perceived importance of a task for an individual's identity and self-worth; utility value, the perceived importance or usefulness of a task for accomplishing future goals; and cost value, the perceived negative aspects of engaging in a task (e.g., time consumption). Expectancy-value theory posits that an increase in any of these values (except cost) will lead to greater motivation toward an academic task.

Of these three positive task values, Eccles and colleagues consider utility value to be the most ""extrinsic"" because it extends beyond the task itself to connections between that task and other tasks, activities, or goals (Wigfield & Eccles, 1992), and it may therefore be the task value most responsive to external intervention. In educational contexts, a student finds utility value in a topic if they believe it is useful and relevant beyond the immediate situation, for other goals or aspects of their life. Correlational research documents that when students perceive utility value in their courses, they work harder, develop more interest, and perform better (Brophy, 1999; Harackiewicz, Durik, Barron, Linnebrink-Garcia, & Tauer, 2008; Hulleman, Durik, Schweigert, & Harackiewicz, 2008; Wigfield, 1994). Moreover, recent experimental research indicates that it is possible to promote perceived utility value with simple interventions that ask students to write about the relevance of course topics to their own life or to the life of a family member or close friend (Canning & Harackiewicz, 2015; Hulleman et al., 2010; Yeager et al., 2014). This leads students to discover connections between course topics and their lives, in their own terms.

Discovering these connections helps students appreciate the value of course work, and can promote a deeper level of cognitive engagement (Harackiewicz & Hulleman, 2010). In other words, the intervention works by changing how students think about course topics. In addition, we know from experimental laboratory work (Canning & Harackiewicz, 2015) that self-generated utilityvalue information (i.e., utility-value connections that students identify for themselves) is more powerful than externally communicated utility-value information (as might be produced, e.g., when a professor tells students that material is important and relevant). The key is having students work to find the utility value for themselves, which is facilitated through writing assignments that are central to the intervention.

The utility-value intervention can promote academic performance by fostering student engagement with course content, and by helping students find personal value in the material. This intervention works best for students who doubt their competence and for those with a history of poor performance. Students who struggle in classes or doubt their competence are at greater risk for disengagement with course content (Durik, Hulleman, & Harackiewicz, 2015). However, Hulleman and Harackiewicz (2009) found that their UV intervention raised interest and grades for ninth grade science students who had low performance expectations in the course, relative to students in a control group who wrote summaries of course topics. Hulleman, Godes, Hendricks, and Harackiewicz (2010) found that a UV intervention promoted interest in an introductory psychology class for students who had performed poorly on early exams, relative to a control group. They also showed that the UV intervention promoted students' perceptions of utility value in the psychology course, and that this increase in perceived utility value then increased interest, intention to major, and grades.

# Can Utility-Value Interventions Close Achievement Gaps?

Although the UV intervention has proven effective in increasing motivation and academic performance for high school and college students who had low success expectancies and/or low performance early in the course, it has not previously been implemented to close racial or social-class achievement gaps. We hypothesize that both URM and FG students will benefit from a UV intervention relative to majority and CG students, in much the same way that students with a history of low performance benefit from these interventions. The UV intervention might prove effective for all students with a history of poor performance, whether URM, FG or not, in which case its efficacy would be attributed to its power to engage students who struggle academically (Durik, Hulleman, & Harackiewicz, 2015), regardless of ethnicity or generational status. Alternatively, the intervention might have additional power for URM and FG students. It is important to test whether UV intervention effects are moderated by prior performance, URM status, or FG status, in analytic models that include all three potential moderators (i.e., prior performance, URM status, and FG status), to determine whether the UV intervention has unique potential for URM and/or FG students.

Indeed, there is reason to hypothesize that the UV intervention might promote performance for underrepresented students in STEM courses, over and above the positive effects documented for low-performing students in previous research. Goal congruity (Diekman, Brown, Johnston, & Clark, 2010), cultural mismatch (Stephens et al., 2012) and identity-based motivation (Oyserman & Destin, 2010) theories all suggest that congruity between a person's identity, culture, or goals and the educational context can serve as a powerful motivational resource, and conversely, that a mismatch between personal goals and the educational context can lead to disengagement. Mismatch problems may be most acute in college STEM courses because the culture of science can be incongruent with the goals of at-risk students (Diekman, Clark, Johnston, Brown, & Steinberg, 2011).

Smith, Thoman, and colleagues have found that communal goals such as working with, forming social connections with, or

helping others are more frequently endorsed by URM college students, and that these types of goals are often perceived as inconsistent with the culture of science (Brown, Smith, Thoman, Allen, & Muragishi, 2015; Smith, Cech, Metz, Huntoon, & Moyer, 2014; Thoman, Brown, Mason, Harmsen, & Smith, 2015). Research also suggests that FG students are more likely to have interdependent or ""other-focused"" goals in college (Harackiewicz, Canning et al., 2014; Piff, Kraus, Côté, Cheng, & Keltner, 2010; Stephens et al., 2012). Indeed, many researchers have noted that communion-a trait which reflects a greater emphasis on working with or helping others-is higher among ethnic minorities (Markus & Conner, 2013), and that Latino, Native American, and African American cultures especially emphasize helping members of their own communities (Fryberg & Markus, 2007; Harper, 2005; Smith et al., 2014; Torres, 2009). This analysis suggests that URM and FG students may struggle to stay engaged in STEM courses that do not seem to share their communal or ""other-focused"" goals.

We hypothesize that a UV intervention may help underrepresented students find connections to important communal goals in STEM courses even if the courses do not emphasize communal themes in their curriculum (Brown et al., 2015). In other words, the UV intervention may provide underrepresented students the opportunity to make course content congruent with their own goals. By giving students the opportunity to connect science content to their own lives in their own terms, they may be better able to identify the relevance of course topics to their personal goals, and become more motivated to engage with science content. Deriving meaningful connections between science and communal goals may be particularly important for students endorsing such goals, and thus the UV intervention may be uniquely powerful for underrepresented students.

# Disentangling Race and Social Class in Intervention Research

Both URM and FG students face disadvantages in college; however, there may be some challenges specific to URM students, and not FG students (e.g., racial discrimination), and some that are unique to FG students (e.g., fewer educational/ financial resources). Moreover, because race and social class are increasingly correlated in American society (Duncan & Murnane, 2011; Reardon, 2011), some students (those who are both URM and FG) may experience both sets of challenges. Thus, students may face challenges related to their URM status, their FG status, or both, and disadvantages may be compounded for FG-URM students (Jack, 2014). A number of social-psychological intervention studies have addressed either racial gaps (e.g., Cohen et al., 2006; Sherman et al., 2013; Walton & Cohen, 2011) or social class gaps in academic achievement (e.g., Harackiewicz, Canning et al., 2014; Smeding, Dumas, Loose, & Régner, 2013; Stephens et al., 2014). Given that social class and ethnicity are often confounded, it is not always clear whether interventions are addressing racial or social-class achievement gaps, or both. For example, Stephens Hamedani, and Destin (2014) tested a difference-education intervention (in which incoming students learned about how different educational backgrounds can impact college experiences) that improved performance for FG students, yet 38% of the FG students were also African American or Latino. Although the researchers controlled for ethnicity in their analyses, they did not consider the interactions between race and social class.

Similarly, many interventions to close racial achievement gaps have not considered the impact of social class. In the Cohen et al. (2006) study testing a VA intervention with African American students, students' social class (or parents' educational attainment) was not reported nor was it included in analyses. In another VA study, Sherman et al. (2013) noted that virtually all of the Latino students were receiving lunch assistance (whereas few of the White students were), and that the racial gap was thus largely redundant with the social-class achievement gap. This overlap of race and social class in some populations makes it especially difficult to identify the groups for whom interventions are most effective

It should be possible, however, to examine the independent and interactive effects of race and social class with a diverse sample and adequate statistical power. One goal of the current research is to disentangle intervention effects associated with race from those associated with social class in a large-scale intervention study with college students in an introductory biology course. To explore these possibilities, we collected baseline measures of prior academic performance, high school poverty rate, performance expectancies for the biology class, science background, psychological experiences, and motivation. Consideration of these variables may help us identify the psychological processes most relevant for interventions with particular groups of students (Walton, 2014), and help interpret differences in responsivity to socialpsychological interventions among students who may have intersecting identities.

#### Intersectionality

Intersectionality is a theoretical approach that simultaneously considers multiple categories of identity, difference, and disadvantage, such as gender, race, social class, sexual orientation, disability, and religion (Cole, 2009). This approach, originally based in critical race theory and feminist theory (Few-Demo, 2014), is critical of researchers' tendency to consider a social category, such as African Americans, to be homogeneous, when in fact members of that category vary substantially on other dimensions such as social class and gender. In the research reported here, we consider the intersection of race and social class.

Ferree (2010) noted that an approach is labeled intersectional if it considers multiple dimensions of inequality ""and considers how they interactively define the identities and experiences . . . of individuals and groups"" (p. 428). There is some debate among intersectionality researchers regarding whether, when intersectionality is combined with quantitative methods, it involves testing for multiple main effects of the intersecting dimensions, or whether it should involve statistical interactions between intersecting dimensions (Ferree, 2010). In the case of the intersection of race and social class, the main effects approach can detect the additive effects of race and social class, thereby disentangling these effects, which are so often confounded. The statistical interaction approach, which is consistent with Ferree's definition above, examines whether certain combinations of race and social class (such as URM and FG status) have especially potent effects. In the research reported here, we test for both additive and interaction effects. Moreover, because intersectionality researchers have rarely used experimental methods, we present a novel test of intersectionality by testing a three-way interaction between the intervention and two intersecting person factors, race, and social class.

#### The Present Study

We tested two interventions, one that has proven to be effective for reducing some achievement gaps in middle-school and college classes (the VA intervention), and one that has proven to be effective for students with a history of low academic performance (the UV intervention). We address two primary questions about these interventions: (a) Can the UV intervention reduce achievement gaps?; and (b) Can the VA intervention be paired with a UV intervention? In other words, can a domain-general, identity-based intervention (VA) and a domain-specific, curriculum-based intervention (UV) be combined in a college biology course, and how might they work together? Such a combination might be additive or synergistic, with each boosting the effectiveness of the other, but these two interventions have not previously been combined, and it is unclear whether two writing-based interventions can be implemented effectively in a single course.

In this study, we focused on closing achievement gaps in an introductory biology class, and tested UV and VA interventions in a 2 × 2 crossed design. Our design and a large sample allowed us to disentangle the independent and interactive effects of race (URM or Majority) and generational status (FG or CG) in moderating the effectiveness of the interventions. Although we focus mainly on social-psychological variables, we also included a social-structural variable, percent free/reduced lunch at the students' high schools, as a proxy for poverty at both the school and neighborhood level.

#### Method

We implemented the UV and VA interventions in an introductory biology course in a double-blind, randomized experiment at a large Midwestern university, across four semesters, in the first course of a two-course sequence. This foundational course, offered in both Fall and Spring semesters, is a prerequisite for 34 undergraduate biomedical majors at this university (e.g., biochemistry, neuroscience, nursing, zoology) and a critical gateway course for premedical preparation and further study in the biological sciences. Over these four semesters, 2,378 students were enrolled in this course, of whom 8% were underrepresented minority students (URM) and 21% were first-generation students (FG; i.e., no parent/guardian obtained a 4-year college degree).1 All consenting URM and FG students enrolled in the course were included in this study, as well as a randomly selected subset of continuinggeneration (CG) majority students (CG-majority students in this sample were 82% White, 18% Asian or Asian American). The remaining CG-majority students in the course received comparable assignments but were not included in the study. Of the 1060 undergraduate students who were eligible for this study across four semesters, 1,040 (417 male, 623 female) completed the course and gave consent for access to their academic records (6 students did not consent, and 14 dropped the course). Participants were 423

<sup>1</sup> This distribution of FG and URM students was comparable to overall university demographics for the time period of this study.

CG-majority, 427 FG-majority, 126 CG-URM (51 African American, 61 Hispanic, 14 Native American), and 64 FG-URM (26 African American, 35 Hispanic, 3 Native American) students.

The 15-week biology course covered three units: cellular biology, genetics, and either evolutionary biology (in Semesters 1 and 2), or animal physiology (in Semesters 3 and 4). Students met three times per week for 50-min lectures. Between one and three lecture sections were offered each semester (for a total of eight lecture sections across the four semesters). In addition to lectures, students attended a 3-hr laboratory, led by a graduate teaching assistant, once each week. There were approximately 15-40 laboratory sections in each semester. Students also attended a 50-min recitation each week, led by a different graduate teaching assistant.

### Interventions

Students were blocked on URM and FG status, gender, and lecture section and then randomly assigned to one of four conditions in a fully crossed 2 × 2 (UV Intervention × VA Intervention) experimental design. Instructors and teaching assistants were blind to experimental condition.

UV intervention. Students completed either three UV or three control assignments. These writing assignments were fully integrated into the course and were presented as a course assignment from the instructors. Three weeks prior to each unit exam, course instructors e-mailed the assignment to each student. Students were given 5 days to complete each essay and turned them in via an online course management site. In both conditions, students were asked to:

Select a concept or issue that was covered in lecture and formulate a question. Select the relevant information from class notes and the textbook, and write a 1-2 page essay.

The utility-value (UV) assignment varied slightly across the four semesters, but all UV assignments asked students to answer their question using course material and discuss the relevance of the concept or issue to their own life or to the lives of others:

Write an essay addressing this question and discuss the relevance of the concept or issue to your own life. Be sure to include some concrete information that was covered in this unit, explaining why this specific information is relevant to your life or useful for you. Be sure to explain how the information applies to you personally and give examples.

In contrast, the control assignment instructed students to address their question by summarizing course material:

Select the relevant information from class notes and the textbook, and write a one to two page response to your question. You should attempt to organize the material in a meaningful way, rather than simply listing the main facts or research findings. Remember to summarize the material in your own words.

Biology graduate students were hired to grade each assignment on scientific merit and to ensure that students followed directions. Although some graduate student graders were also teaching assistants, graders were never assigned to grade essays of students who were in their laboratory or recitation sections. The fact that assignments and graded feedback were turned in via a course management site (and not during lecture or lab time) ensured that all teaching assistants remained blind to their students' conditions. Grader feedback and essay

grades were provided to each student a few days before the unit exam. Each assignment was worth 0.6% of the final grade in the course; 1,034 students completed the first assignment, 1,017 students completed the second essay assignment, and 1,006 students completed the third essay assignment (95% of students completed all three assignments).

VA intervention. The VA intervention was administered in laboratory sessions early in the semester, and students wrote about personal values, as in previous research (Harackiewicz, Canning et al., 2014; Miyake et al., 2010). Students in the VA condition were instructed to write about why two or three values, selected from a list, were important to them. Students in the control condition were instructed to choose the two or three values that were least important to them, and to write about why other people might hold those values. Full methodological details regarding the implementation of VA are reported by Harackiewicz, Canning et al. (2014).

#### Baseline Measures

In the second week of the course, a questionnaire was administered in laboratory sections, with questions about attitudes about biology and demographic information. All questionnaire items were answered on a 7-point scale ranging from not at all true to very true or not at all to a lot, unless otherwise noted. Scale scores represent the mean of constituent items. Missing data (less than 1% on each measure) were handled by multiple imputation (Rubin, 1987).

Attitudes about biology. Biology background was measured with three items (for each of three topics covered in the course: ""I have a strong background in [cellular biology, genetics, and evolution or animal physiology];"" α = .84). Belonging uncertainty (Walton & Cohen, 2011) was measured with two items (""When something bad happens, I feel that maybe I don't belong at University X;"" ""Sometimes I feel that I belong at University X, and sometimes I feel that I don't belong at University X;"" a = . 83). Competence valuation (Harackiewicz & Sansone, 1991) was measured with two items (""It is important to me to do well in this course;"" ""I want to do well in Introductory Biology;"" α = .71). Desire to contribute to society was measured with one item (""I want to study biology because I want to make a contribution to society""). Confidence about performance was measured with three items (""I am confident that I will do well in Introductory Biology;"" ""I expect to get a good grade in this course;"" ""I am confident that I can obtain a final grade of B or better in this course;"" a = .82). Interest in biology was measured with five items (""I'm really looking forward to learning more about biology;"" ""Biology fascinates me;"" ""I think the field of biology is very interesting;"" ""I'm excited about biology;"" ""To be honest, I just don't find biology interesting,"" reversed; α = .93). Perceived utility value was measured with four items (""The material we are studying in this course is useful for everyone to know;"" ""This class is important to my future;"" ""I think what we are learning in Introductory Biology 151 is important;"" ""The study of biology is personally important to me;"" a = . 74).

Motives for attending college. We administered a shortened version of Stephens, Fryberg, Markus, Johnson, and Covarrubias' (2012) scale in which students were asked to indicate which of 10 items characterized their reasons for completing their college degree (checking as many as were relevant). Half the items referred to independent motives (i.e., ""Become an independent thinker;"" ""Learn more about my interests;"" ""Prepare for a future career;"" ""Expand my understanding of the world;"" and ""Expand my knowledge of the world""), whereas the other half referred to interdependent motives (i.e., ""Help my family out after I'm done with college;"" ""Give back to my community;"" ""Provide a better life for my own children;"" ""Show that people with my background can do well;"" and ""Be a role model for people in my community""). Independent and interdependent motives were measured by counting how many of the motives in each category were selected. In addition, we constructed a measure of helping motives by counting how many of three interdependent motives that demonstrate the instrumentality of a college education for helping others (""Give back to my community;"" ""Help my family out after I'm done with college;"" ""Provide a better life for my own children"") were selected.

Prior grade-point average (GPA) and high school poverty rate. We obtained students' GPA from prior semesters from university records (n = 978). We also obtained information about the high school each student attended, in terms of the percentage of students who received financial assistance for school meals (percent free or reduced lunch) at those schools, as an indicator of poverty at the school or neighborhood level (n = 979). However, given that some students were freshmen or transfers, and that high school information was not available for all students, we were missing some data on both measures. Thus, we used multiple imputation (Rubin, 1987) to create a measure of prior GPA and free/ reduced lunch (FRL) for all students.

#### Outcome Measures

Coding of articulated utility value and essay length. The utility-value and control writing assignments were coded for the level of utility-value articulated in each essay. Research assistants coded the assignments on a 0-4 scale based on how specific and personal the utility-value connection was to the individual. A ""0"" on this scale indicates no utility; a ""1"" indicates general utility applied to humans

generically; a ""2"" indicates utility that is general enough to apply to anyone, but is applied to the individual; a ""3"" indicates utility that is specific to the individual; and a ""4"" indicates a strong, specific connection to the individual that includes a deeper appreciation or future application of the material. Utility-value scores from the three essays were summed to create an overall measure of articulated utility value. Interrater reliability with this coding rubric was high, with two independent coders providing the same score on 91% of essays. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. Research assistants also recorded the number of words in each essay so that we could test whether students wrote more in UV conditions, or if certain groups of students wrote more, possibly reflecting higher levels of task engagement.

Biology course grade. Course instructors provided final course grades at the end of the semester (4.0 scale: A = 4.0, AB = 3.5, B = 3.0, BC = 2.5, C = 2.0, D = 1.0, F = 0). Grading standards were consistent across sections and semesters.

Results

# Overview

Table 1 presents descriptive statistics and intercorrelations for all measures. Although students were randomly assigned to condition at the student level, we used hierarchical linear modeling to account for the nested structure of the data (students nested within eight lecture sections, across four semesters; Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002). We tested a two-level random-intercept model in which students were nested within the eight lecture sections, taking into account the interdependencies in the data-between students in the same lecture section-by estimating within and between component variance. The intraclass correlation coefficient was small; lecture sections accounted for only 1.67% of the variance in biology course grade. Although this analysis demonstrated that the nesting of students would not have a large effect on our analyses compared to multiple regression models,

we modeled the nesting structure so that accurate standard errors would be obtained. We present comparisons of regression and HLM results for the primary analyses in Tables 2 and 3. Analyses with HLM and regression yielded consistent results. Regression results are reported here so that we can report effect sizes (betas).

## Background Differences for URM and FG Students

We tested the main effects of URM status (majority = - 1, URM = 1), FG status (CG = - - 1, FG = 1), and their interaction for each baseline measure, controlling for gender (female = 1,

Table 3 Effects of the UV Intervention, URM Status, and FG Status on Biology Course Grade

Note. UV = utility-value intervention condition (UV = +1, control = - 1); URM = underrepresented minority (URM = +1, majority = - 1); FG = first-generation (FG = +1, continuing-generation = - 1); GPA = grade-point average.

male = - 1) on all baseline measures.2 Table 2 presents the full regression and HLM results for all background variables.

Prior GPA and high school poverty rate. On prior GPA, there were independent negative effects for both URM and FG status, ß = - 0.13, p < . 001, and ß = - 0.16, p < . 001, respectively, indicating both a racial achievement gap (Cohen's d = 0.27) and a social-class achievement gap (d = 0.31), which when considered together, indicate that FG-URM students had the lowest prior university GPAs (Figure 1, Panel A). On high school poverty rate (FRL), independent positive effects for both URM and FG status, B = 0.21, p < . 001, and β = 0.34, p < . 001, respectively, revealed that URM students attended more impoverished schools than majority students, and that FG students attended more impoverished schools than their CG peers. Furthermore, the URM by FG interaction was also significant, ß = 0.14, p = . 001. FG-URM students attended the most impoverished high schools and, by implication, lived in the most impoverished neighborhoods (see Figure 1, Panel B).

Attitudes about biology and motives for attending college. There were no independent or interactive effects of URM or FG status on confidence about performance, interest in biology, perceived utility value, or independent motives for attending college, p > .100. There was a negative effect of URM status on biology background, ß = - 0.07, p = . 035, a positive effect of FG status on belonging uncertainty, ß = 0.08, p = . 049, as well as positive effects of URM status on competence valuation, ß = 0.07, p = .042, and desire to contribute, ß = 0.06, p = . 062. On helping motives, we found independent positive effects for both URM and FG status, ß = 0.15, p < . 00 and ß = 0.21, p < . 001, respectively, as well as a URM by FG status interaction, ß = 0.09, p = . 022, indicating that FG-URM students had the strongest motivation to help their families and communities.3 In fact, 80% of FG-URM students selected all three helping motives as reasons for attending college. Figure 2 presents these variables, standardized around the overall sample mean, for the four groups: CG-majority, FGmajority, CG-URM, and FG-URM. Considered together, these results show a unique pattern of challenges (higher high school poverty rate, lower prior GPA, weaker perceived biology background, higher belonging uncertainty) and positive motivations

(higher levels of competence valuation, desire to make a contribution, and helping motives) for the FG-URM students in this class.

Gender differences. We found significant effects of gender on five of 11 baseline measures. Females reported lower levels of confidence about performance, ß = - - 0.24, p < . 001, and higher levels of perceived utility value, ß = 0.08, p = . 008, competence valuation, ß = 0.12, p < . 001, belonging uncertainty, ß = 0.08, p = . 016, and helping motives as reasons for attending college, ß = 0.08, p = . 006, than male students. The effect of gender on prior GPA was not significant ß = 0.06, p = . 057, but women had slightly higher prior GPAs than men (d = 0.10). In contrast, men performed slightly better than women in this class (d = - 0.16), but this difference was also nonsignificant, p = . 22.

## Course Performance

The primary outcome measure was course grade. Preliminary analyses revealed that there were no significant effects of the VA intervention for any group (i.e., there was no main effect of VA, no VA × URM Status interaction, no VA × FG Status interaction, and no VA × URM × FG interaction), and no significant interactions of VA with UV (these statistical tests are reported below). Therefore, we collapsed across VA condition for the analyses reported here, resulting in a two-cell UV versus control design. We used confidence about performance as a covariate to control for baseline performance expectations, and prior GPA as a covariate to control for prior performance. The basic model, which was tested for biology course grade and related variables, included 11 terms: the main effects of the UV intervention, URM status, and FG status, 3 two-way interactions (UV Intervention × URM Status, UV Intervention × FG Status, and URM Status × FG Status), 1

<sup>2</sup> We also tested all interactions with gender and group status and found no significant interactions on any baseline measure, except for high school poverty rate (% free/reduced-priced lunch). An interaction between gender, URM and FG status, ß = - 0.09, p = . 025, revealed that FG-URM males came from the most impoverished high schools.

<sup>3</sup> This pattern also held for the five-item interdependent motives scale, of which helping motives were a three-item subset.

three-way interaction (UV Intervention × URM Status × FG Status), as well as the two covariates (confidence about performance and prior GPA), and 2 two-way interactions between the UV intervention and each of the covariates.4 Including both covariates and their interactions with the UV intervention allowed us to test whether the effects found here are consistent with previous studies that found the UV intervention was particularly effective for students with low performance expectations (Hulleman & Harackiewicz, 2009) and students with low grades (Hulleman et al., 2010). Table 3 presents the results for course performance in regression and HLM.

For course grade, there was a negative effect for URM status, ß = - 0.13, p < . 001, showing that majority students obtained higher grades in the class than URM students. There were also positive effects of confidence about performance, ß = 0.15, p < .001, and prior GPA, ß = 0.55, p < . 001, indicating that confident students and students with higher prior GPAs performed better in the course than students with lower confidence and students with lower prior GPAs, respectively.

Figure 2. Standardized baseline measures as a function of URM (majority or URM) and generational (CG or FG) status. URM = underrepresented minority: CG = continuing generation: FG = first-generation.

A significant UV main effect, ß = 0.08, p = . 024, showed that the UV intervention improved performance slightly for all students, on average (M = 2.81, 95% CI [2.74, 2.87]), relative to control (M = 2.76, 95% CI [2.68, 2.83]), d = 0.06. In addition, course performance was somewhat higher for URM students in the UV condition relative to control, compared with majority students, ß = 0.06, p = .092 for the two-way interaction of UV with URM status (Figure 3, Panel A). The performance gap for URM students was substantial in the control condition, d = .60, p < . 001. The treatment effect for URM students was .20 grade points (d = 0.23), resulting in a 40% reduction in the racial achievement gap.

However, this two-way interaction effect was qualified by a significant three-way interaction between the UV intervention, URM status, and FG status, ß = 0.08, p = . 015. The UV intervention was most effective for FG-URM students (Figure 3, Panel B). The performance gap for FG-URM students, relative to CGmajority students, was large in the control condition, .84 grade points, d = . 98, p < . 001. The treatment effect for FG-URM students was .51 grade points (d = 0.55), resulting in a 61% reduction in the achievement gap for these students.

UV replication analyses. The inclusion of the interactions between the UV intervention and both confidence about performance and prior GPA in our basic model allowed us to test for replication of prior utility-value research, and we found evidence for partial replication. Hulleman and Harackiewicz (2009) found that a UV intervention was most effective for students with low performance expectations. This finding was not replicated in our

<sup>4</sup> We tested all higher order interactions of the UV intervention, confidence about performance, prior GPA, URM status, FG status, and gender on course grade in a fully crossed model through the three-way level. There was not a significant effect of gender, nor were there any significant interactions between the intervention and gender; thus gender was excluded from the basic model. The UV × URM × FG interaction remained significant when all higher order effects were included, and the effect size did not change (Yzerbyt et al., 2004). We found no significant three-way interactions apart from the one reported in the text, and we therefore trimmed the model accordingly (Cohen, Cohen, West, & Aiken, 2003). However, the 2 two-way interactions between the UV intervention and confidence and prior GPA were retained in the basic model to test for replication of prior findings.

sample, ß = 0.03, p = . 203. However, there was a significant negative interaction between the UV intervention and prior GPA, ß = - 0.05, p = . 045, indicating that the UV intervention was most effective for students who had the lowest prior GPAs. This finding replicates previous research (Hulleman et al., 2010), and suggests that the UV intervention can help students with a history of poor performance, in addition to helping FG-URM students.

Testing the effects of high school poverty rate. Thus far we have focused on one important aspect of social class, firstgeneration student status. However, social class encompasses both generational status and poverty levels. In order to test high school poverty as a predictor of academic performance and determine whether UV effects were moderated by high school poverty, we added several new terms to our basic model. Specifically, we added the main effect of high school percent free/reduced lunch (FRL), 2 two-way interactions with FRL (UV Intervention × FRL and URM Status × FRL), and the three-way interaction between the UV intervention, FRL, and URM status. In this model, there was a significant main effect of FRL on course performance, t(1024) = 3.30, p = .001, β = - . 10, showing that students from poorer high schools obtained lower grades in the course. However, there were no significant interactions of FRL with either URM status or the UV intervention, ps > .30. In contrast, the positive main effect of the UV intervention remained significant, t(1024) = 1.93, p = . 05, ß = . 07, as well as the interaction between the UV intervention and prior GPA, t(1024) = 2.00, p = . 05, ß = - . 05. Most important, the UV × FG × URM interaction remained significant, t(1024) = 2.19, p = . 03, ß = . 08, with FRL controlled.3 These analyses suggest that although high school poverty and generational status both influenced academic performance, the UV intervention was effective for FG-URM students even when FRL was taken into account.

### Mediation Analyses

To understand the motivational processes underlying the effects of the UV intervention, we first examined the content of students' essays in terms of articulated utility value, with the basic model described above. As expected, students in the UV condition articulated more utility value (i.e., made more personal connections to curricular content) in their essays (M = 8.76, 95% CI [8.57, 8.95]) than controls (M = 1.56, 95% CI [1.44, 1.69]), ß = 0.87, p < . 001. This important manipulation check indicates that our curricular intervention was successful in encouraging students to make personal connections with the course material in their writing assignments. There was also a significant effect of prior GPA, ß = . 05, p = . 001, and a significant UV × GPA Interaction, ß = 0.06, p < .001; students with higher prior GPAs articulated more utility value in their essays, particularly in the UV condition. However, there were no significant interactions with FG or URM status (p > .40), suggesting that the effect of the intervention was comparable for all groups, in terms of helping students articulate the utility value of course topics.

Next, we examined the length of students' essays with the same regression model. There was a main effect of prior GPA, ß = 0.19, p < . 001; students with higher prior GPAs wrote longer essays. In addition, students wrote longer essays in the UV condition (M = 506 words, 95% CI [476.99, 534.49]) compared with control (M = 479, 95% CI [469.23, 488.39]), ß = 0.11, p = .008, suggesting that the UV intervention promoted engagement with curricular content, averaged across all students. A three-way interaction between the UV intervention, URM and FG status, ß = 0.12, p = .004, revealed that FG-URM students showed the largest intervention effect, writing longer essays in the UV condition (M = 506 words, 95% CI [476.99, 234.49]) than in control (M = 433, 95% CI [389.10, 476.32]), suggesting that they became particularly engaged with this assignment. Compared with their peers in the control condition, FG-URM students in the UV condition wrote, on average, about 73 more words in their essays (see Figure 4).

<sup>5</sup> We also tested higher order interaction terms, but none were significant. The effects of FRL were not limited to course performance. Ancillary analyses revealed a significant effect of FRL on prior GPA. t(1034) = 4.23. p < .001, ß = - 0.13, controlling for URM and FG status, which continued to be significant predictors, t(1034) = 3.03, p = . 002, ß = - 0.10 and t(1034) = 2.80, p = . 005, ß = - 0.12, respectively. This suggests that the effects of high school poverty on college grades are independent of the effects of URM and FG status.

Figure 4. Average essay length as a function of treatment condition (UV or control), URM status (majority or URM), and generational status (CG or FG). Error bars are 95% confidence intervals. UV = utility-value; URM = underrepresented minority; CG = continuing generation; FG = firstgeneration.

Considered together, these analyses suggest that students in the utility-value condition made more personal connections to the course material in their essays (as requested by the utility-value assignment) than in control conditions, but that FG-URM students became particularly involved in the process of writing about utility value, writing longer essays in the intervention condition. A critical question is whether essay length (an indicator of cognitive engagement) mediated the effects of the UV intervention on performance for FG-URM students, who wrote more words and who benefited most from the intervention, in terms of course performance.

Moderated mediation analysis. We tested the indirect effects of the UV intervention on course grade through essay length as a function of URM and FG status, in a test of moderated mediation (Hayes, 2013, Model 12). Table 4 shows the effects of UV intervention, URM status, FG status, and essay length on course grade and the indirect effect for each student group (i.e., CG-majority, FG-majority, CG-URM and FG-URM). The confidence interval testing the indirect effect of the UV intervention through essay length does not include zero for FG-URM (95% CI [0.010, 0.076]) and CG-Majority (95% CI [0.004, 0.028]) students.6 Thus we can conclude that essay length partially mediated the positive effect of the UV intervention on course grade for these two groups of students, with the largest indirect effect for FG-URM students, who wrote longer essays and benefitted most from the UV intervention.

#### Exploratory Text Analyses

To investigate essay content more fully, we used Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) text analysis to determine whether the content of the essays varied as function of the UV intervention and URM or FG status. LIWC software calculates the degree to which people use different categories of words (e.g., personal pronouns, social processes, cognitive mechanisms) in their writing by calculating how many words from each LIWC dictionary appear in each document. (Pennebaker, Booth, & Francis, 2007).

Utility-value assignments are designed to encourage students to write differently, in terms of both style and content, than when they are simply summarizing the course material (as in the control writing assignments). For example, UV assignments are designed to promote personal writing, which is expected to contain more references to the self and/or other people (i.e., social language) and use more ""everyday"" language than typical scientific writing. In addition, the process of making connections between course material and their own lives is expected to deepen students' cognitive processing and increase engagement with the material, which should also be reflected in the content of students' essays.

We selected nine LIWC dictionaries that might capture the style and content of UV writing. We hypothesized that the UV assignment would prompt the use of more personal pronouns and shorter words (i.e., simpler words and less technical vocabulary), as indexed by the LIWC personal pronouns (e.g., I, us, your) and longer words (> 6 letters) dictionaries.

We used the social processes dictionary (e.g., advice, discuss, encourage), and its three subcategories-family words (e.g., mom, daughter, brother), friend words (e.g., friend, buddy, neighbor), and human words (e.g., adult, baby, boy)-to explore the social content of students' essays. These dictionaries assess relationships and communication with others (Tausczik & Pennebaker, 2010). Finally, to explore content related to cognitive involvement, we chose the cognitive mechanism dictionary (e.g., cause, conclude, explain) and two subcategories-insight words (e.g., consider, idea, understand) and causal words (e.g., because, effect, hence). The insight dictionary assesses active learning, encoding, and understanding, and the causal dictionary connotes attempts to explain causes and effects (Klein & Boals, 2001; Pennebaker & King, 1999; Pennebaker & Stone, 2003).

We examined the number of words used from each of the nine LIWC categories as a function of the UV intervention, URM status, and FG status. In addition to the 11 terms of our basic model, our model for these exploratory text analyses also controlled for gender and the UV × Gender interaction, because previous research using LIWC has found gender differences in word usage (e.g., Newman, Groom, Handelman, & Pennebaker, 2008). For these analyses we were interested in the main effect of the UV intervention, to determine if students wrote differently in UV essays, compared with control essays. We were also interested in the UV × URM × FG interaction, to explore whether any treatments effects differed for FG-URM students. The regression results are shown in Table 5.

As expected, students in the UV condition used more personal pronouns, ß = 0.82, p < . 001, and fewer long words (> 6 letters), ß = - 0.16, p < . 001. In addition, UV essays contained more social words, ß = 0.53, p < . 001, family words, ß = 0.37, p < .001, friend words, ß = 0.11, p = . 009, and human words, ß = 0.25, p < . 001, than control essays. There were also more cognitive mechanism words, ß = . 21, p < . 001, and insight words, ß =

<sup>6</sup> We also tested for moderated mediation of the UV × GPA effect on performance by essay length, but found no evidence for mediation.

Table 4 Essay Length as a Mediator of the UV Intervention Effect

Note. UV = utility-value (UV = +1, control = −1); URM = underrepresented minority status (URM = +1, majority = - 1); FG = first-generation status (FG = +1, continuing-generation = - 1); GPA = grade-point average.

.33, p < .001, in UV essays, suggesting that students' writing in the UV condition was more characteristic of active cognitive engagement in the course content (Pennebaker & Francis, 1996; Pennebaker & King, 1999), but there were no significant effects on causal words. Considered together, these results indicate that the utility-value essays contained more personal writing and social themes, as well as greater evidence of cognitive engagement than control essays.

Interestingly, significant UV × URM × FG interactions on social words, ß = . 11, p = . 002, family words, ß = . 08, p = . 043, cognitive mechanism words, ß = . 10, p = . 02, and insight words, ß = . 11, p = . 005 (see Figures 5 and 6) indicated that FG-URM students, who wrote longer UV essays and benefitted most from the UV intervention, wrote essays that contained more social words, as well as more words indicative of cognitive involvement with the course material. Consistent with our finding that FG-URM students are especially oriented toward helping their families and communities, their UV essays contained more family words (but not more friend or human words, suggesting a relative emphasis on family).

#### Moderation Analyses

Another way to gain insight into the dynamics of the UV intervention is to examine moderation by individual-difference

variables. Our primary model revealed that the UV intervention was effective for students with low prior performance, as has been shown in previous research (Hulleman et al., 2010). Given that the intervention had a positive effect for FG-URM students controlling for this interaction with prior GPA, our results suggest that the efficacy of the UV intervention for FG-URM students is not completely explained by the efficacy of the UV intervention for students with low prior GPA.

To explore whether UV effects might be moderated by the background variable of helping motives, we tested whether the UV intervention was effective, more generally, for students who endorsed helping motives as a reason for attending college, regardless of prior GPA, ethnicity or generational status. Given that there was so little variance in helping motives among FG-URM students (80% of them selected all three helping motives as reasons for

<sup>7</sup> We tested whether these differences in essay content for FG-URM students mediated the effects of the intervention on performance with the same moderated-mediation model reported in Table 4, by testing all five potential mediators (i.e., word count, social words, family words, cognitive mechanism words, and insight words) first individually and then simultaneously. Word count was the only significant mediator, indicating that increased engagement in the material (as indexed by longer essays) rather than the specific content of the essays, accounted for the UV intervention effects on course performance for FG-URM students.

attending college), however, we could not test models that included these students. We therefore excluded FG-URM students in this analysis in order to test whether the UV intervention improved performance for other students who endorsed helping motives. Accordingly, we tested a variation of the basic model: in this exploratory model, we did not include the terms testing the FG × URM and UV × FG × URM interactions (because there were no FG-URM students in this analysis) and we controlled for the effect of gender and the UV × gender interaction (because gender was a significant predictor of helping motives in the baseline analyses). This resulted in a model with 13 terms: the main effects of the UV intervention, helping motives, URM status, and FG status, and 3 two-way interactions (UV Intervention × URM Status, UV Intervention × FG Status, and UV Intervention × Helping Motives), as well as three covariates (confidence about performance, prior GPA, and gender), and their two-way interactions with the UV intervention. 8

Of interest in this model was whether helping motives predicted performance or moderated the effects of the UV intervention. We found a negative effect of helping motives, ß = - 0.09, p = . 001, indicating that students who selected more helping motives as reasons for attending college received lower grades in the course. In this model, the main effect of the UV intervention was not significant, ß = - - 0.01, p = .813 (but recall that FG-URM students are omitted from the analysis), but we found a positive interaction between the UV intervention and helping motives, ß = 0.05, p = . 047, indicating that the UV intervention was most effective for students who endorsed more helping motives. Notably, the UV × Prior GPA interaction was somewhat reduced, but still nearly significant, ß = - 0.04, p = . 094, indicating that the helping moderation observed in this model was independent of the prior GPA moderation documented earlier. This result supports our hypothesis that the UV intervention can be particularly effective for students who are motivated by a desire to help others.

# Failure to Replicate Previous Values Affirmation Finding

In a previous study in the same context, we had tested the VA intervention alone (i.e., without implementing the UV intervention) in a single semester, and found that it improved performance for FG students, relative to CG students (Harackiewicz, Canning et al., 2014). This effect did not differ according to URM status, and the VA intervention did not affect performance for URM students. In the present study, in which the UV and VA interventions were

<sup>8</sup> We also tested higher order interaction terms, but none were significant.

both implemented across four semesters, the positive effect of VA for FG students was not replicated. Table 6 presents the model testing the UV intervention crossed with the VA intervention and shows that there were no significant effects of VA, and that all the UV effects reported previously remained significant when VA terms were included in the model. Here we consider four possible reasons for this nonreplication: (a) the earlier finding could have been a false positive; (b) continued administration of the VA exercise over many semesters may have reduced its effectiveness; (c) the size of achievement gaps may have been different in the earlier study than in the current one; and (d) students had more writing assignments in the current study than in the earlier study, and the UV intervention, which involved more writing, could have outweighed the effects of the VA intervention.

Although it is possible that the earlier finding was a false positive, the results were consistent with previous work in college courses (Miyake et al., 2010), as well as a conceptual replication of several earlier studies in different contexts (Cohen et al., 2006; Cohen & Sherman, 2014). Indeed, the VA intervention has proven effective at addressing achievement gaps in various educational contexts. However, there have been some previous failures to replicate these effects (e.g., Dee, 2014; Kost-Smith et al., 2012), and it is important to explore other factors that might account for nonreplication.

Although the VA intervention was administered with methods identical to those employed in this same context by Harackiewicz, Canning et al. (2014), it is possible that the continued administration of VA (and UV) interventions over a 3-year period in the same course led to some communication between students or teaching assistants that weakened the impact of the interventions in this study. This issue may be more critical in the case of ""stealth"" interventions such as the VA intervention, however, because communication about the intervention can undermine treatment efficacy (Cohen et al., 2012; Cohen & Sherman, 2014). Curricular interventions such as the UV intervention may be more robust to such effects. We monitored the administration of both interventions carefully, and detected no problems, but in a large course with multiple sections of large lectures, many instructional staff, and several discussion and laboratory sections, there may have

been undetected factors that detracted from implementation efficacy (Cohen et al., 2012).

Another possibility is that achievement gaps differed between the samples. We examined achievement gaps in course grades in the control condition of each study, to examine performance in the biology class for students who received neither intervention (25% of students in the current study, n = 226) or did not receive a VA intervention (50% of students in the Harackiewicz, Canning et al. (2014) study, n = 396). We conducted 2 × 2 regression analyses of the effects of FG status, URM status, and their interaction, on course grade, controlling for gender and confidence about performance, in the control group of each sample. Table 7 shows course performance for all four groups of students in the control conditions of each study. In the Harackiewicz, Canning et al. (2014) sample, we found a significant effect for FG status, ß = - - 0.30, p < . 000, and a significant effect for URM status, ß = - 0.14, p = .006. In the current sample, we found that the FG effect was not significant, ß = - 0.07, p = . 417, but that the URM effect was, ß = - 0.19, p = . 005. These analyses indicate that the performance difference between majority and URM students in the control condition (i.e., the racial achievement gap in this course) was comparable in the two studies (mean grade point difference of .38 and .36, respectively), but that the difference in performance between FG and CG students (i.e., the social-class achievement gap in this course) in the control condition was much larger in the Harackiewicz, Canning et al. (2014) study than in the current study (mean grade point difference of .48 and .08, respectively). This occurred mainly because FG controls in the current study performed considerably better than those in the previous one; in addition, CG students in the current study performed slightly less

well than those in the previous study. It is likely that VA is more effective when achievement gaps are larger, and previous research substantiates this view (Hanselman, Bruch, Gamoran, & Borman, 2014).

It is also possible that differences in the educational context account for differences in treatment efficacy. Although the structure and content of the biology course was constant across the two

studies, there may have been differences in the way the course was taught by different instructors, and this may have influenced how the VA intervention worked. In fact, one important feature of the course differed by design: in the present sample, three writing assignments (the UV/control essays) were added to the curriculum. Thus students were required to do more writing in the biology course in the present study compared to the same course in the Harackiewicz, Canning et al. (2014) and this may have changed students' experiences of the course. It is possible that the VA intervention was less effective because the course was more writing-intensive or seemed to place a greater emphasis on personal writing. Given that the UV and the VA interventions both involve personal writing, it also seems possible that the extensive writing in the three UV essay assignments outweighed the brief VA writing exercises conducted in laboratory sessions in the present study, thereby dampening the effect of the VA intervention. This suggests that it may not work to combine different types of writing interventions in a single semester (Walton, Logel, Peach, Spencer, & Zanna, 2014).

Our results, considered together with other nonreplications of VA effects (Dee, 2014; Kost-Smith et al., 2012), suggest that although values affirmation can have powerful positive effects, it is sensitive to contextual and sample differences in ways that we do not yet fully understand (Walton, 2014; Yeager & Walton, 2011). More research is needed to identify factors that moderate the effectiveness of the VA intervention in college contexts, and future research should also examine how VA interventions work in conjunction with other interventions.

#### Discussion

There have been many attempts to address achievement gaps in high school and college classes, but researchers have typically focused on just the racial achievement gap or just the social class gap (Cohen et al., 2006; Harackiewicz, Canning et al., 2014; Sherman et al., 2013; Stephens et al., 2014; Walton & Cohen, 2011). To our knowledge, this is the first intervention study designed to close achievement gaps that has also been designed to disentangle the effects of race from the effects of social class. Our findings illustrate the importance of analyzing the separate and interactive effects of URM and FG status when evaluating interventions intended to close achievement gaps. Focusing on one gap to the exclusion of the other overlooks the challenges and motivational patterns unique to each group. We found that our UV intervention was particularly helpful for a unique group of underrepresented students-FG-URM students-who came into this course with the lowest grades, highest levels of high school poverty, and weakest biology background. In other words, the UV intervention was most effective for the students who began the course with the most disadvantages.

On average, the UV intervention promoted performance for all students. Thinking about how course topics relate to their own life, or the lives of others, made biology more relevant to students, and helped them stay engaged in their coursework. Students wrote longer essays when thinking about utility value, and this may reflect greater engagement with course topics (Elliot & Klobucar, 2013). The assignment may also have promoted deeper cognitive processing of the material, facilitating learning (Harackiewicz, Tibbetts et al., 2014), and this is supported by the text analysis

findings. Students in UV conditions used more cognitive mechanism words, especially insight words, which Pennebaker and King (1999) argue reflect active thinking and learning. Considered together, these results contribute to a growing body of work showing that curricular interventions based on psychological principles can promote active engagement and performance in college science classes (Deslauriers, Schelew, & Wieman, 2011; Haak, HilleRis-Lambers, Pitre, & Freeman, 2011).

For interventions to close achievement gaps, however, the effects must be strongest for disadvantaged groups, and we found the largest UV intervention effect for FG-URM students in this study. This result highlights the potential of the UV intervention to address important achievement gaps in college classes. Moreover, content analyses revealed that writing about utility value was particularly effective for FG-URM students. Although all students articulated more utility value in UV conditions, the process of articulating utility value was particularly effective for FG-URM students. They wrote longer essays in the UV condition, and mediation analyses revealed that this increased engagement with course material contributed to their increased performance in the course. Moreover, LIWC text analyses revealed that their essays contained more words indicative of active thinking, which may help account for their improved performance in these conditions (Klein & Boals, 2001).

#### First-Generation Underrepresented Minority Students

What accounts for the greater responsivity of FG-URM students to the UV intervention? Our analyses provide some insight into the mechanisms at work for these students. One possibility is that the intervention was most effective for FG-URM students because UV interventions are most effective for students with lower prior grades (Hulleman et al., 2010), and FG-URM students had the lowest prior GPA among the categories of students. Notably, the positive effect of the UV intervention for FG-URM students remained significant after accounting for the effect of prior GPA and for the positive effects of the intervention for students with lower prior grades. This suggests that the UV intervention may work to promote engagement and close achievement gaps for multiple reasons that go beyond the issue of prior performance.

For example, the UV intervention may also work by helping students connect course material to important personal goals. Our moderation analysis, in which we tested whether individual differences in helping motives moderated the effects of the UV intervention, revealed that the UV intervention was more effective in improving performance for students who endorsed helping motives. This suggests that the UV intervention may be particularly impactful for FG-URM students, who endorsed more helping motives for attending college than any other group of students.

Consistent with previous research, FG-URM students in this study were highly motivated to succeed in the course, and they were particularly motivated by communal goals, such as helping others, contributing to society, or giving back to their families and communities (Smith et al., 2014; Smith, Brown, Thoman, & Diener, 2015; Stephens et al., 2012). From the perspective of both Stephens' cultural mismatch theory and Diekman's goal congruity theory, the UV intervention may have been especially powerful for FG-URM students because it gave them the opportunity to explore connections between the course content and their communal goals, thereby alleviating a sense of goal incongruity or cultural mismatch. Indeed, the LIWC text analyses revealed that FG-URM students in the UV condition were most likely to include content related to social processes, and family words in particular, in their essays. Discovering and appreciating the utility value of curricular content for their communal values and goals may, in turn, have increased their engagement with curricular content (as evidenced by their longer essays and more frequent use of cognitive engagement words in UV conditions), and inspired them to work harder in the course. Rather than addressing a deficit, the UV intervention may work for these students by relating the curriculum to students' strengths-their positive motivations for studying biology.

In contrast, the UV intervention did not help FG-majority students, and our baseline analyses offer some insight into why our intervention was more effective for some groups than others. Our findings suggest that FG students (both majority and URM) tended to feel more uncertainty about belonging, and we would not expect a UV intervention, which is specific to curricular content, to impact a student's more general sense of belonging in college. For these students, targeting their uncertainty about belonging might prove more effective (Ostrove & Long, 2007; Walton & Cohen, 2011). Interventions that target social belonging processes, such as Walton and Cohen's (2011) belonging intervention, focus on students' experiences or sense of fit in the academic environment (Walton, 2014), and might be more effective with FG students. Indeed, Stephens et al. (2014) found that a difference-education intervention in which freshmen FG students heard stories about positive FG student experiences was effective in helping FG students adjust to college and perform better in their classes.

Different interventions address different psychological processes, and it is important to consider the motivational patterns of the students targeted by interventions. Given that different interventions may not work well together (Walton et al., 2014), it is especially important for intervention researchers to understand the characteristics of the group they hope to help, in order to identify the most effective interventions to implement with that particular group. Only by considering the independent and interactive effects of race and social class were we able to identify the unique background and motivational profile of FG-URM students and document the full potential of the UV intervention to promote performance for the underrepresented students most at risk in this course.

#### The Intersection of Race and Social Class

We tested both the additive and interactive effects of race and social class, as well as the three-way interaction of race, social class, and the UV intervention, on academic and motivational variables and found evidence for both the main effects and the interactional approach to intersectionality. We measured 11 baseline variables, including prior GPA, high school poverty rate, confidence, baseline interest, and helping motives, and found a mixed pattern of results. On some measures (e.g., baseline interest, confidence) we found no group differences; on others, we found a single main effect (e.g., URM students reported lower levels of biology background than majority students and FG students reported higher levels of belonging uncertainty than CG students). On other measures, we found two main effects but not an interaction (e.g., prior GPA), supporting the additive model of inter-

sectionality. On the measures of high school poverty and helping motives, however, we found two main effects and a significant interaction, supporting the interactive model. The interaction effect on high school poverty, for example, indicates that FG-URM students came from more impoverished schools and neighborhoods than either their race or generational status would predict. The interaction effect on helping motives suggests that FG-URM students are particularly motivated to help others and give back to their communities. Only by measuring a number of baseline variables were we able to gain a nuanced understanding of differences between student groups and intersecting categories. These findings indicate the power of this statistical approach to identify important intersectionalities, and may contribute to development of more effective interventions in the future.

With respect to the primary outcome of course grade, we were able to explore additive and interactive models of intersectionality in moderating treatment effects. On course performance, we found a main effect of race, but not FG status, nor a URM × FG interaction. Perhaps most interesting, the three-way interaction with the intervention was significant (UV × URM × FG, Table 4, Figure 3), demonstrating that intersectionality can apply to the effects of an intervention. That is, the intervention was differentially effective as a function of both the race and social class of the students and was particularly beneficial for FG-URM students.

This same three-way interaction was also found for essay length; the intervention had a strong effect for FG-URM students, who became particularly engaged in the utility-value writing assignments. In the variables derived from LIWC analyses, this three-way interaction was found for social-process words, family words, cognitive-mechanism words, and insight words, in all cases showing the pattern that the intervention was especially potent for FG-URM students. Overall, then, the findings point to the importance of considering the intersection of social categories in intervention research. Whereas prior gap-closing intervention studies have focused on single social categories, our results suggest that this approach may neglect important within-group differences that only an intersectional approach can fully address. By considering students' intersecting identities, intervention researchers can develop a more nuanced understanding of both the populations they seek to help and the effectiveness of their interventions.

## Implications for Expectancy-Value Theory

In this study we attempted to identify variables that may account for differential effects of the UV intervention, and our findings suggest that the relationships are complex. We found that the UV intervention was moderated by social class, race, prior GPA, and helping motives. The UV intervention implemented in an introductory biology course was effective for FG-URM students (a doubly disadvantaged category of students; Jack, 2014), for students with low prior GPAs (an academic background category), and for students with high helping motives (a motivational category). These findings extend the range of groups who can benefit from a UV intervention, and contribute to our understanding of how UV interventions work, and to expectancy-value theory more generally.

By testing both prior performance and baseline performance expectations (confidence about performance) as moderators of the UV intervention effects in the same model, we were able to test which variable was more important in this context. We found that prior performance was the more critical moderator of UV effects, whereas performance expectancies did not moderate the effects of the UV intervention. This helps us understand the expectancy side of the expectancy-value model (Eccles, 2009). Prior research has employed one moderator or the other; in laboratory studies with new learning activities, for example, researchers typically test self-reported expectancies as the moderator, because there is no history of prior performance to consider (Canning & Harackiewicz, 2015; Shechter, Durik, Miyamoto, & Harackiewicz, 2011). In classroom studies, researchers have used either self-reported performance expectations (Hulleman & Harackiewicz, 2009) or prior exam performance (Hulleman et al., 2010) to assess expectancies. Expectancies are of course shaped by prior performance experiences (Eccles, 2009; Pajares, 1996), but one measure reflects performance history and the other is more forward-looking. In an introductory college course, however, students may not be able to gauge how well they will do in the course (in fact, we found no group differences in confidence at baseline, despite eventual group differences in course grades), and thus prior performance may be the more relevant moderator in this context. Therefore, to determine which expectancy variables are important moderators of UV intervention effects, it is important to consider both self-reported expectancies and prior performance in any given context.

Furthermore, our mediation and content analyses provide some insight into UV mechanisms, and here we address the value side of the expectancy-value model. Our results help us understand how writing about utility value may help to promote performance-by increasing engagement in the writing assignments, by providing opportunities to write differently (i.e., including more personal and social content), and by encouraging active thinking about course topics. Although were able to show that engagement in the writing assignment (measured in terms of essay length) mediated course performance, most of our other analyses were more exploratory, and highlight a need for future research. One important question concerns the connections between these mechanisms. For example, in writing UV essays, do students first find personal examples and then become more engaged with course content, or does greater engagement help students make more personal connections? Are these separate processes, and how might we measure them more objectively? It is difficult to conduct fine-grained process analyses in a large-scale classroom intervention study, and future research may require controlled laboratory studies to advance our understanding of the motivational mechanisms that underlie the effectiveness of the intervention. Overall, this research contributes to a better understanding of how students think about value in science classes, and illuminates the value side of expectancy-value theory, which is understudied compared with the expectancy side (Harackiewicz, Rozek, Hulleman & Hyde, 2012). Our results show the power of utility value in enhancing students' academic achievement, and highlight new areas for future research.

## Strengths and Limitations

Although our sample was large enough to disentangle the effects of racial and generational status, sample sizes of different racial/ ethnic groups were not large enough to explore differences between racial groups. In particular, we considered African American, Latino, and Native American participants together in a single URM category, and were not able to separate these groups in analyses because of limited sample sizes. Our findings point to the importance of considering intersectionality in social science research, and it will be particularly important for future research to address intersectionality on a more specific level (e.g., the intersection of African American and FG identities). Different interventions may be more or less effective for different racial and cultural groups, and these are important issues to pursue in future research.

Similarly, the use of first-generation college student status as a measure of social class captures an important aspect of social class in the higher education context, but a dichotomous measure does not capture the full range of parental educational levels that may contribute to students' experiences in college. Furthermore, FG status does not capture all aspects of social class that may contribute to achievement gaps. For example, limited financial resources and the need to work part- or even full-time while attending college are major barriers for low socioeconomic status (SES) students (Pascarella, Pierson, Wolniak, & Terenzini, 2004) and we would not expect a psychological intervention to address these financial barriers. Indeed, by including high school free/reduced lunch (as a proxy for poverty at the school and neighborhood levels) as a predictor, we found that high school poverty had an independent negative effect on performance, over and above the effects of FG and URM status. Nonetheless, the effects of FG and URM status remained, as well as the positive effect of the UV intervention for FG-URM students. These issues will be important to address in future research with more direct measures of income and poverty level, as well as ways to capture high school quality directly.

Finally, although we inferred that FG-URM students in our sample perceived an incongruity or mismatch between their motivations and values and the norms of science, we did not collect measures of students' perceptions of incongruity or mismatch. We hypothesized that the UV intervention provided FG-URM students the opportunity to make course content congruent with their own values and goals, and indeed, the treatment effects on social process and family words for FG-URM students suggests that the content of their essays was congruent with communal goals. However, we were not able to measure whether the UV intervention changed perceptions of incongruity, and thus our analysis remains speculative. If the UV intervention is particularly powerful because it helps FG-URM students resolve a mismatch between their communal goals and their perceptions of scientific fields, it will be important to measure these perceptions as well as the psychological experience of mismatch in future research.

## Conclusions

Racial and social class achievement gaps are a major issue in higher education. When these gaps occur in introductory science courses, they can lead URM and FG students to abandon STEM majors and careers. Our utility-value intervention successfully reduced the achievement gap for URM students by 40% and for FG-URM students by 61%. Moreover, the intervention was designed for implementation within the curriculum in large-lecture classes, making it practical for widespread implementation at low cost. This simple curricular change-asking students to reflect on personal connections to course material in course assignmentscould help students remain engaged in introductory courses and ultimately widen the STEM pipeline.

Michael Schaerer Singapore Management University Martin Schweinsberg ESMT Berlin

## Roderick I. Swaab INSEAD

This research demonstrates that people can act more powerfully without having power. Researchers and practitioners advise people to obtain alternatives in social exchange relationships to enhance their power. However, alternatives are not always readily available, often forcing people to interact without having much power. Building on research suggesting that subjective power and objective outcomes are disconnected and that mental simulation can improve aspirations, we show that the mental imagery of a strong alternative can provide some of the benefits that real alternatives provide. We tested this hypothesis in one context of social exchange-negotiations-and demonstrate that imagining strong alternatives (vs. not) causes powerless individuals to negotiate more ambitiously. Negotiators reached more profitable agreements when they had a stronger tendency to simulate alternatives (Study 1) or when they were instructed to simulate an alternative (Studies 3-6). Mediation analyses suggest that mental simulation enhanced performance because it boosted negotiators' aspirations and subsequent first offers (Studies 2-6), but only when the simulated alternative was attractive (Study 5). We used various negotiation contexts, which also allowed us to identify important boundary conditions of mental simulations in interdependent settings: mental simulation no longer helped when negotiators did not make the first offer, when their opponents simultaneously engaged in mental simulation (Study 6), and even backfired in settings where negotiators' positions were difficult to reconcile (Study 7). An internal meta-analysis of the file-drawer produces conservative effect size estimates and demonstrates the robustness of the effect. We contribute to social power, negotiations, and mental simulation research.

Social conflict is pervasive. One of the most common ways to resolve conflict is through negotiation. Negotiation can be defined as a discussion aimed at resolving a perceived divergence of interests between two or more parties (Pruitt & Carnevale, 1993), which can include individuals, groups, organizations, or even countries. For example, individuals negotiate their job offers, groups divide a pool of resources, organizations negotiate mergers and acquisitions, and countries negotiate trade agreements or peace accords. Negotiating parties are usually interested in securing profitable agreements. To help negotiators achieve their goals, scholars and practitioners recommend to identify strong alternatives before the negotiation because alternatives provide the necessary power to ask for more (Fisher, Ury, & Patton, 2011; Thompson, 2011) and even negotiators themselves prefer having alternatives over no alternatives (Schaerer, Swaab, & Galinsky, 2015). The notion that having alternatives is beneficial is also supported by empirical evidence: Decades of negotiations research shows that negotiators with strong alternatives secure more profitable agreements than negotiators with weak or no alternatives (e.g., Malhotra & Bazerman, 2007; Pinkley, Neale, & Bennett, 1994; Schaerer et al., 2015; Thompson, 2011; Thompson, Wang, & Gunia, 2010).

Despite the benefits of strong alternatives, negotiators are not always able to obtain outside options. In fact, more often than not, negotiators have no alternative at all. For example, 60% of psychology students graduate college without any job offer (NACE, 2014) and many business school graduates need to negotiate jobs in the absence of an outside offer (GMAC, 2015; Grant, Nurmohamed, Ashford, & Dekas, 2011). This poses significant challenges for negotiators as the absence of alternatives lowers their aspirations (Wong, 2014), feelings of confidence (Schaerer et al., 2015), and willingness to negotiate (Magee, Galinsky, & Gruenfeld, 2007)-all of which are critical for achieving a profitable agreement. Unfortunately, little research has investigated how negotiators can overcome the lack of a strong alternative. Examining this question would address an important theoretical gap in the social power literature, which has focused almost exclusively

on the benefits of powerfulness at the expense of understanding whether and how the powerless can compete successfully (Schaerer, du Plessis, Yap, & Thau, 2016). An answer to this question would also be of practical importance because a lack of alternatives causes negotiators to settle on suboptimal outcomes (Pinkley et al., 1994; Thompson & Hrebec, 1996). For example, a job candidate who does not have an alternative offer (compared with a candidate who has an alternative) may be more likely to think that negotiating a job offer is inappropriate, even if doing so could leave both candidates and recruiters better off.

Negotiators who lack alternatives typically fail to secure profitable agreements because they do not set sufficiently high aspirations, preventing them from making ambitious offers (Galinsky, Ku, & Mussweiler, 2009; Zetik & Stuhlmacher, 2002). This implies that if negotiators without alternatives were able to set more ambitious aspirations, they could demand more from their opponent and overcome some of the disadvantages of being powerless. The present research investigates a mechanism that could motivate powerless negotiators to do so: the mental simulation of having an attractive alternative. We propose that the mental simulation of an attractive alternative causes negotiators to set higher aspirations when they lack an actual alternative which, in turn, motivate them to demand more from their opponent and improve their final agreements.

The current studies contribute to the literatures on social power, negotiations, and mental simulation in important ways. First, the majority of social power research has focused on the consequences of being high in power (Schaerer, du Plessis, et al., 2016), at the expense of understanding powerlessness. The current research advances the psychology of powerlessness by proposing a novel mechanism through which those in a seemingly disadvantaged position can perform more effectively in competitive social interactions. Second, past research has suggested that strong alternatives not only serve as a safety net that prevents negotiators from accepting a bad deal but also serve as ambitious reference points that boost negotiators' aspirations. The present research finds that when alternatives are unavailable and aspirations are naturally low, mentally simulating alternatives may be a way for negotiators to reap at least some of the cognitive advantages that real alternatives typically offer. Third, the present research extends research on mental simulation (Epstude & Roese, 2008; Roese, 1994) by being one of the first to take the broader social context into account. We leverage the dynamic nature of bargaining and the diversity of negotiation contexts to identify several boundary conditions of mental simulation in a context where individuals' behaviors and outcomes are inherently interdependent. Finally, by employing real and incentivized negotiation paradigms (Studies 3-5) we also answer a call for increasing the external validity of experimental social power research (Schaerer, Lee, Galinsky, & Thau, in press).

#### The Power of Alternatives

The negotiation literature suggests that the most important source of power is a negotiator's alternatives and that negotiators with no alternatives will find it hard, if not impossible, to achieve profitable agreements because powerlessness undermines their aspirations (for a review, see Galinsky, Schaerer, & Magee, 2017). Negotiation power is typically conceptualized as the quality of a negotiator's alternative, or BATNA (Best Alternative to a Nego-

tiated Agreement, see Fisher et al., 2011). Negotiators with stronger alternatives set higher aspirations (Pinkley et al., 1994; Wong, 2014), demand more from their opponent (de Dreu, 1995), and behave more agentically to achieve their goals (Magee et al., 2007). In addition, negotiators with stronger alternatives use more threats (Lawler, 1992), take more risk (Anderson & Galinsky, 2006), claim larger shares of total payoffs (Komorita & Leung, 1985; Pinkley et al., 1994), and are influenced less by their counterparts' emotions (Van Kleef, De Dreu, Pietroni, & Manstead, 2006). Thus, not having a strong alternative makes it challenging for negotiators to be ambitious and engage in behaviors that help them secure profitable agreements.

The idea that obtaining alternatives is a precondition to negotiating ambitiously and securing profitable agreements is rooted in the assumption that the functional value of alternatives primarily lies in the power they provide. For example, alternatives can help put pressure on the counterpart or signal one's worth in the marketplace (e.g., Kim, Pinkley, & Fragale, 2005; Pinkley, 1995; Pinkley et al., 1994). In contrast to this assumption, however, recent research has suggested that negotiation alternatives serve a dual role: they not only provide power but also act as salient anchors that influence negotiators' decision-making (Schaerer et al., 2015). This implies that the absence of structural power does not necessarily prevent one from setting high ambitions. Indeed, Schaerer and colleagues (2015) found that, despite feeling less powerful, negotiators without any alternative secured more profitable agreements than negotiators with a weak alternative. This occurred because weak alternatives served as low anchor values that weighed down both negotiators' aspirations and the value of their first offer. Thus, powerful negotiators do not always make aggressive first offers and powerless negotiators do not always open modestly.

## Acting More Powerfully Without Power

The research reviewed above suggests that negotiators may be able to take advantage of the disconnect between power and ambition and behave more ambitiously, even when they lack actual alternatives. Specifically, we propose that mentally simulating an attractive alternative (i.e., thinking about what it would be like to have a strong alternative) should cause negotiators to set higher aspirations, demand more from their opponent, and in turn help them achieve more advantageous outcomes. Our proposal that the mental image of an alternative causes people to set higher aspirations is based on mental simulation research (Kahneman & Miller, 1986; Roese, 1997). Mental simulation involves the construction of hypothetical possibilities, or counterfactuals, that highlight the usefulness of a particular action, which is then translated into a corresponding behavioral intention and goal-directed behavior (Epstude & Roese, 2008). For example, students who were asked to generate hypothetical thoughts about performing better on a recent exam subsequently reported greater intentions to engage in performance-facilitating behavior for future exams (Roese, 1994). Mental simulation can even affect task performance. In one study, participants who imagined performing well on an anagram task expected to be more successful and, as a result, also performed better in a subsequent anagram task (Sherman, Skov, Hervitz, & Stock, 1981). Thus, the imagery of a possibility is a precursor to expectancy and expectancy is a precursor to reality.

98

Mental simulations also play an important role in negotiations. For instance, negotiators who had their first offer immediately accepted (compared with those who had to negotiate) were less satisfied after the negotiation because they engaged in greater counterfactual thinking, mental simulations about ""what might have been"" had they made a different offer (Galinsky, Seiden, Kim, & Medvec, 2002). Likewise, negotiators who negotiated more (vs. fewer) issues felt worse about their outcome because their preoccupation with a larger number of issues generated more counterfactual thoughts about better possible outcomes (Naquin, 2003). Other research investigating the influence of mental simulation on negotiation outcomes has focused on learning from a negotiation that has already occurred and on the relative performance of different types of counterfactuals (Kray, Galinsky, & Markman, 2009; Wong, Haselhuhn, & Kray, 2012). For example, Kray and colleagues (2009) found that negotiators who generated additive counterfactuals about a past negotiation (e.g., ""If only I had made the first offer . . . '') gained a competitive advantage over those who generated subtractive counterfactuals (e.g., ""If only I had not made the first offer. . . ."") because the former facilitated learning. Despite these insights, it remains unclear whether mental simulation (a) affords negotiators a bargaining advantage, (b) affects performance in an upcoming negotiation without having to rely on a salient experience from a recent negotiation, (c) operates through routes other than learning, and (d) under what conditions mental simulation is unlikely to be effective and potentially even backfires.

We propose that mental simulation can improve negotiators' performance by cognitively changing a negotiator's expectations. Specifically, the link from mental simulation to expectancy is driven by activating a script, or knowledge, that guides the pursuit of relevant goals (Epstude & Roese, 2008; Roese & Olson, 1993). For example, Smallman and Roese (2009) demonstrated that counterfactual judgments (compared with control judgments) reduced the RTs to respond to content-specific prompts, suggesting that counterfactual judgments made such knowledge more readily accessible. Such activated knowledge, in turn, can cause people to anchor on a goal-relevant reference point and encourages them to pursue this goal more strongly (Chapman & Johnson, 1999). This process tends to be more effective for more attractive reference points (Epstude & Roese, 2008; Roese, 1994).

Based on these findings, we propose that negotiators who generate cognitions about what it would be like to have a strong alternative activate information (e.g., ""a strong alternative would allow me to negotiate more successfully"") will also set higher expectations (e.g., ""I should be more ambitious""). In negotiations, such expectations are usually reflected in a negotiator's aspiration price-the best outcome that a negotiator can reasonably hope to achieve (Walton & McKersie, 1965). Thus, powerless negotiators who mentally simulate a strong alternative are likely to set higher aspirations than those who do not engage in mental simulation or those who simulate unattractive alternatives (Hypothesis 1).

Negotiators with higher aspirations, in turn, should make more ambitious first offers. Aspirations can have a strong influence on how individuals approach negotiations (e.g., White & Neale, 1994). For example, negotiators who focus on their (high) aspirations tend to open the negotiation more assertively by making higher first offers compared with those who do not or those who focus on their (low) walkaway point instead (Galinsky & Muss-

weiler, 2001; Schaerer et al., 2015). Thus, we further predicted that negotiators who mentally simulate a strong alternative would make more ambitious first offers than those who do not engage in mental simulation (Hypothesis 2) because the former have higher aspirations (Hypothesis 3).

These predictions have important implications for the remainder of the negotiation. Past research has established strong correlations between the value of the first offer and the final negotiation outcome (see Loschelder, Trötschel, Swaab, Friese, & Galinsky, 2016 for a review) such that more ambitious first offers result in a larger piece of the bargaining pie (Galinsky et al., 2009). Although the first mover advantage emerges in both single and multiissue negotiations (Gunia, Swaab, Sivanathan, & Galinsky, 2013), it is driven by how much negotiators demand from the distributive issues (i.e., issues for which the parties hold opposing interests and that are of similar importance to each party), not by how much they ask on the integrative issues (i.e., issues for which parties hold opposing interests of differing importance that allow trade-offs) or compatible issues (i.e., issues of mutual interests). Thus, negotiators who mentally simulate a strong alternative should claim more value from the negotiation than those who do not engage in this simulation (Hypothesis 4) because they demand more from the distributive issues (Hypothesis 5). Our theoretical model is depicted in Figure 1.

# Interpersonal and Structural Limitations of Mental Simulations

An additional goal of this research was to identify and test potential limitations of mental simulation in interdependent contexts. Past research on mental simulation has primarily relied on laboratory settings in which individuals' performance was independent of the behavior of other social actors and in which there were few, if any, structural constraints (Epstude & Roese, 2008; Roese, 1994, 1997). Even the few studies that tested the effects of mental simulation in contexts where actors are naturally interdependent generally focused on the cognitions and behavior of an isolated party or utilized tasks where agreement was relatively easy to achieve in contexts such as negotiations (e.g., Galinsky et al., 2002; Kray et al., 2009), group decision-making (e.g., Galinsky & Kray, 2004), or intergroup settings (e.g., Stathi & Crisp, 2008; Turner, Crisp, & Lambert, 2007). Thus, it remains unclear whether the effectiveness of mental simulation is contingent on the behavior of the counterparty or structural aspects of a situation that make agreements more difficult to achieve. These are critical gaps in our understanding of mental simulation effects because most interpersonal interactions, including negotiations, do not operate in a social vacuum free of structural constraints. Thus, to further test our theoretical model of mental simulations we examined three

distinct interpersonal and structural factors in the context of negotiation that can either attenuate or reverse the positive effect of mental simulations.

## First Offer Order

First, we propose that mentally simulating attractive alternatives should only result in a negotiation advantage when the focal negotiator makes the first offer. Indeed, prior research has repeatedly demonstrated that high aspirations are particularly likely to translate into better negotiation outcomes when negotiators move first (Gunia et al., 2013; Loschelder et al., 2016). However, when negotiators move second, they are strongly influenced by the first offer they receive from their opponent and may rely less on their own aspirations when making counteroffers (e.g., Galinsky & Mussweiler, 2001; Schaerer, Loschelder, & Swaab, 2016). As a result, we propose that mentally simulating attractive alternatives will increase final negotiation outcomes when the focal negotiator makes the first offer, but less so when they move second (Hypothesis 6).

#### Simultaneous Mental Simulation

Second, we propose that imagining attractive alternatives will only yield a bargaining advantage when the mental simulation across negotiators is asymmetric. That is, mental simulation should be particularly helpful when focal negotiators have sufficient room to convert their high aspirations into more value claimed. In contrast, doing so is likely more challenging when the opponent is also engaging in mental simulation and more ambitious in their aspirations as a result. Thus, we predict that imagining attractive alternatives is more effective when the focal negotiator engages in mental simulation but their opponent does not (Hypothesis 7).

## Nonoverlapping Walkaway Points

Finally, we propose that imagining alternatives may backfire when parties' walkaway-points for a particular issue do not overlap sufficiently and make agreement challenging, or even impossible (e.g., Galinsky, Maddux, Gilin, & White, 2008; Maddux, Mullen, & Galinsky, 2008; Sinaceur, Maddux, Vasiljevic, Perez Nückel, & Galinsky, 2013). Indeed, when the bargaining zone (i.e., the distance between negotiators' walkaway-points) for a particular issue is negative, setting high aspirations and making ambitious offers increases the difficulty of finding an agreement because negotiators are unlikely to accept offers below their walkawaypoints (e.g., Pruitt & Rubin, 1986; Thompson, 1995). Instead, negotiators have to be creative and identify additional issues to transform negative bargaining zones on an issue into mutually beneficial agreements. This is less likely to occur when negotiators have very high aspirations and make very demanding offers that only set the parties' positions further apart.

The idea that mentally simulating alternatives can be detrimental in negotiations with a negative bargaining zone is consistent with prior research suggesting that negotiators who are too aspirational and too strongly focused on the outer boundaries of settlement are likely to lose sight of solutions that benefit themselves as well as their opponent (White & Neale, 1994). For example, past research showed that overly ambitious negotiators have a higher likelihood of reaching an impasse than less ambitious negotiators (e.g., Huber & Neale, 1987; Korobkin, 2002; Morris, Nadler, Kurtzberg, & Thompson, 2002). Similarly, negotiators who made extreme first offers at the onset of the negotiation were less likely to reach a deal with their counterpart (Schweinsberg, Ku, Wang, & Pillutla, 2012). Thus, because boosting aspirations through mental simulation has the potential to increase the perceived distance between the two parties' positions, we predict that simulating strong alternatives will be detrimental in integrative contexts where negotiators have to reconcile their seemingly incompatible preferences (Hypothesis 8).

#### Overview of the Present Research

We test our predictions in seven studies that both measured and manipulated the mental simulation of alternatives to explore their impact on different types of mixed-motive interactions: tasks with differing preferences and priorities (Study 1), competitive zerosum interactions (Studies 2-6), and tasks with conflicting positions that mask the compatibility of underlying interests (Study 7). Specifically, Study 1 validates a scale measuring the extent to which people imagine strong alternatives in their negotiations and correlates this with negotiators' ability to claim value during an interactive, face-to-face negotiation including multiple issues. Study 2 examines whether actively imagining alternatives prior to a negotiation can lead to more ambitious first offers because it increases negotiators' aspirations (Hypotheses 1-3). Study 3 uses a sequential negotiation paradigm with simulated opponents to test the effects of mental simulation on negotiation outcomes (Hypotheses 4-5). Study 4 is a face-to-face negotiation conducted in the laboratory and uses a confederate to manipulate negotiators' alternatives. In addition, Study 4 tests whether the effects of mental simulation on negotiation outcomes remain robust when participants are incentivized and negotiate about a real item. Study 5 is not only a constructive replication of the previous studies but also examines whether a distributive advantage emerges when negotiators imagine any alternative or only when they imagine an attractive alternative. Study 6 uses a professional sample and an interactive negotiation via e-mail to test whether the effects of mental simulation are weakened when the opponent makes the first offer (Hypothesis 6) and when the opponent also engages in mental simulation of attractive alternatives (Hypothesis 7). Finally, Study 7 examines whether the high aspirations generated by imagined alternatives backfire when negotiators' positions are difficult to reconcile in an interactive, face-to-face negotiation (Hypothesis 8). In our studies, we report all conditions and measures that were collected. Sample size and exclusion criteria were determined in advance.1

# Study 1: Imaginary Alternatives and Value Claiming

Study 1 assessed the extent to which negotiators have a tendency to simulate better alternatives and whether this tendency is associated with the amount of value claimed in a multiissue negotiation. Given the empirical evidence showing that higher

<sup>1</sup> Although we decided to exclude outliers for all experiments prior data collection, we also report robustness checks when outliers were included (see supplementary online materials).

aspirations are most likely to translate into more value claimed in distributive negotiations (e.g., Freshman & Guthrie, 2009; Galinsky & Mussweiler, 2001; Thompson, 1995; Van Poucke & Buelens, 2002; White & Neale, 1994), we predicted that negotiators who mentally simulate better alternatives would claim more value on the distributive issues (i.e., issues on which negotiators' interests are diametrically opposed). The negotiation task in Study 1 also contained integrative issues with a positive bargaining zone and compatible issues. Because integrative issues (i.e., issues on which negotiators have differential preferences and that require creativity for better performance) and compatible issues (i.e., issues on which both negotiators have the same preferences) are not naturally affected by aspirations (Huber & Neale, 1987) and first offers (Gunia et al., 2013; Loschelder, Swaab, Trötschel, & Galinsky, 2014), we did not expect mental simulations to affect these issues.

## Method

Participants. Participants were 91 professionals (mean age = 29.33; SD = 2.09; 31.9% female) enrolled in a negotiation course as part of their Master of Business Administration program. Participants were randomly matched with a negotiation partner at the beginning of their interactive, face-to-face negotiation.

Procedure. Once assigned to their dyad, participants either took the role of the candidate or the recruiter in the New Recruit negotiation (Neale, 1997). New Recruit is a multiissue negotiation in which parties negotiate the terms of a new employment contract (e.g., salary, vacation time, starting date). Negotiators' preferences were created by assigning points to each of eight issues and participants received a scoring system detailing the point structure (see supplemental online materials). Two issues were distributive (e.g., candidates wanted a higher and recruiters a lower salary), two issues were compatible (e.g., both parties wanted the job to be in San Francisco), and the remaining four issues were integrative (e.g., bonus was more important to the candidate and vacation time to the recruiter; as a result, both negotiators could benefit from a large bonus packaged with little vacation time). Negotiators did not have an alternative (i.e., an impasse resulted in zero points) and could negotiate a maximum of 13,200 points. Participants were given confidential role instructions one week before the negotiation and were allowed 45 min to negotiate a deal face-to-face in their individual breakout rooms. After the negotiation, participants reported their outcomes to the course instructor and were debriefed.

## Measures.

Imaginary alternatives. The extent to which negotiators engaged in mental simulation of attractive alternatives was measured in an unrelated survey at the end of the negotiation course several weeks apart from the actual study. We developed a five-item measure (see supplemental online materials) to capture this construct. Participants rated their tendency to imagine alternatives (e.g., ""When I negotiate, I think about what it would be like to have a better offer."") on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). A pilot study with 100 participants recruited from across the United States via Amazon's Mechanical Turk (mean age = 33.55; SD = 12.00; 54.0% female) confirmed that the scale was internally reliable (α = . 83; M = 4.94; SD = 1.19).

To assess discriminant validity from other constructs that influence aspirations and negotiation outcomes, we analyzed how participants' imaginary alternative score correlated with sense of power (Anderson, John, & Keltner, 2012), optimism (Revised Life Orientation Test; Scheier, Carver, & Bridges, 1994), and the Big 5 personality traits (Gosling, Rentfrow, & Swann, 2003). None of these constructs correlated highly with our imaginary alternatives scale (all rs < . 13; see Table 1).

To assess convergent validity, we examined to what extent participants' imaginary alternatives score correlated with their maximization tendencies (Schwartz et al., 2002). The maximization scale should covary with the imaginary alternatives scale as some items of the maximization scale assess how satisfied people are with their current situation and/or to what extent they hold themselves to high standards (Nenkov, Morrin, Schwartz, Ward, & Hulland, 2008). Indeed, there was a small correlation between the two constructs, r = .26, p = .01. To confirm that the imaginary alternatives scale and maximization tendencies are distinct constructs, we conducted an exploratory factor analysis with varimax rotation. Neither the maximization scale (nor any of the other constructs) cross-loaded highly with the imaginary alternatives factor as the primary factor, or vice versa (all loadings < . 46). However, all five imaginary alternatives items loaded highly onto a single factor (all loadings > .71).

Negotiation outcome. We measured negotiators'individual points achieved on the distributive, integrative, and compatible issues, as well as their overall outcome.

Control variables. To rule out alternative explanations for our prediction, we controlled for negotiators' self-reported strategic intentions (3 item scale, a = .66, e.g., ""I tend to behave in a strategic way"") and creativity (3 item scale, a = .88, e.g., ""People would describe me as a creative negotiator""), their perceived power (3 item scale, a = . 84, e.g., ""In general, I feel powerful""), and their Big-5 personality trait scores (neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness) using the revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-3) developed by McCrae, Costa, and Martin (2005). To address potential endogeneity concerns, we also controlled for whether negotiators were in the buyer or seller role, their age, and their gender. To account for withindyad effects and rule out concerns over nonindependence of individual observations, we clustered negotiators in their respective dyads and controlled for it using a Generalized Estimated Equations (GEE) regression model with a multilevel structure.

\* p ≤ .01.

All dyads reached an agreement. Hypothesis 1 predicted that negotiators who have a stronger tendency to simulate having attractive alternatives would also claim more value on the distributive negotiation issues, but not the integrative or compatible issues. This is what we found. Negotiators' imaginary alternatives score positively predicted value claimed on the distributive issues, b = . 16, SE = . 06, Wald(1) = 6.07, p = . 014 (Model 1, Table 2), and this effect remained robust when we included the control variables in the model, b = . 26, SE = . 12, Wald(1) = 4.91, p = .027 (Model 2, Table 2). However, mental simulation neither predicted performance on the integrative issues (ps > .28; Models 3-4, Table 2) nor on the compatible issues (ps > . 15; Models 5-6, Table 2).

The significant effect of the tendency to simulate alternatives on negotiators' distributive outcomes combined with the effects on the integrative and compatible issues resulted in a significant effect on the overall negotiation outcome, b = . 24, SE = . 10, Wald(1) = 5.96, p = . 015. (Model 7, Table 2). This effect was marginally significant when we included the control variables, b = . 29, SE = .17, Wald(1) = 2.83, p = . 093 (Model 8, Table 2).

## Discussion

Study 1 found that negotiators who lacked an actual alternative claimed more value on the distributive issues as their tendency to engage in mental simulation increased. Consistent with our theorizing, mental simulation had no discernible effect on performance on the integrative or compatible issues. However, Study 1 did not manipulate the mental simulation of alternatives, preventing us from making causal inferences about the effects of mental simulation on performance and leaving it unclear whether negotiators actually simulated alternatives during the negotiation. In addition,

Study 1 did not allow us to examine the underlying mechanisms because we could not measure aspirations and first offers. Study 2 addressed these issues by manipulating the mental simulation of alternatives immediately before the negotiation and examining its subsequent effects on negotiators' aspirations and first offers.

## Study 2: Manipulating Imaginary Alternatives

The aim of Study 2 was to (a) establish a causal link between the mental imagery of strong alternatives and negotiators' first offers and (b) show that this relationship is mediated by negotiator aspirations.

#### Method

Participants and design. Three hundred six participants (mean age = 34.33; SD = 10.35; 42.8% female) were recruited on Amazon's Mechanical Turk in exchange for US\$.50. Participants were randomly assigned to a strong alternative condition, a no alternative condition, or an imaginary alternative condition.

Two participants took part twice (i.e., duplicate IP addresses), two participants failed the attention check, and 14 participants reported extreme values (±3 SDs) for aspirations and/or first offers and were thus excluded from the analyses, leaving 288 participants in our final sample. These exclusion criteria were determined before data collection and applied consistently across all studies using online participants.

Procedure and experimental manipulation. Participants were instructed to sell a second-hand CD and were informed that a potential buyer asked them to make a first offer. Participants then received information about the alternative offers that they had secured or not. In the strong alternative condition, participants read: ""You also know that another buyer has offered you \$8 for the

CD. Thus, if you can't reach an agreement in the current negotiation, you will get \$8 for the CD."" Participants in the no alternative condition read: ""You also know that nobody else has offered you money for the CD. Thus, if you can't reach an agreement in the current negotiation, you won't get any money for the CD."" Participants in the imaginary alternative condition received the same instructions as those in the no alternative condition, but also encountered an additional page of instructions asking them to complete a short thought exercise. Specifically, they were told:

Imagine yourself in a situation in which you have already secured a strong alternative offer from another buyer before entering the negotiation. Imagine what this strong alternative offer would look like, how it would feel like, and how it would affect your upcoming negotiation.

## Dependent measures.

First offer and aspiration price. Following the manipulation, participants made a first offer to the buyer and indicated their aspiration price (i.e., the ideal price they would like to achieve in the negotiation).

Manipulation check. To assess participants' awareness of the imaginary alternatives manipulation, participants answered the question ""While completing the task, I was instructed to imagine an alternative offer that I did not have"" on a scale from 1 (completely disagree) to 7 (completely agree).

Finally, participants completed an attention check developed for online studies (Oppenheimer, Meyvis, & Davidenko, 2009) and reported demographic information.

## Results

Manipulation check. Participants in the imaginary alternative condition reported that they were instructed to simulate having an alternative offer that they did not have to a greater extent (M = 5.51, SD = 1.95) than those in the strong alternative condition, (M = 3.07, SD = 2.35), t(285) = 7.32, p < . 001, and those in the no alternative condition, (M = 3.20, SD = 2.55), t(285) = 6.97, p < . 001. The latter two conditions did not differ (p = . 71).

Aspiration price. Consistent with Hypothesis 1, negotiators in the imaginary alternatives condition had higher aspirations (M = 9.72, SD = 5.81) than those in the no alternative condition (M = 7.45, SD = 4.81), t(285) = 3.54, p < .001, d = .71. Those who had a strong alternative also set higher aspiration prices (M = 10.08, SD = 2.29) than those who had no alternative, t(285) = 3.46, p = . 001, d = . 91. The strong alternative and imaginary alternative conditions did not differ (p = . 92).

First offer. Consistent with Hypothesis 2, negotiators in the imaginary alternative condition made higher first offers (M = 11.20, SD = 6.53) than those in the no alternative condition (M = 8.65, SD = 5.67), t(285) = 3.44, p = . 001, d = . 42 (see Figure 2). Those who had a strong alternative also made higher first offers (M = 10.68, SD = 2.17) than those who had no alternative, t(285) = 2.75, p = .006, d = .47, but did not differ from those in the imaginary alternative condition (p = .49).

Mediation analysis. Next, a mediation analysis tested the prediction that imagining a strong alternative would lead to higher first offers because negotiators had higher aspirations. Because the independent variable was multicategorical, we used the indicator coding recommended by Hayes and Preacher (2014). The indirect

effect of the indicator for the imaginary alternatives condition (1 = imaginary alternatives condition; 0 = all other conditions) was tested while controlling for a second indicator (1 = strong alternatives condition; 0 = all other conditions).2 Negotiators' aspiration prices mediated the effect of simulating an alternative on first offers. A bootstrapping procedure with 5,000 resamples and a 95% bias-corrected bootstrap confidence interval (Preacher & Hayes, 2004) confirmed that there was a significant indirect effect, 95% CI [.8173, 3.758] (see Figure 3). These findings are consistent with the possibility that negotiators who simulated an attractive alternative (vs. those who had no alternative) made higher first offers because they set more ambitious aspiration prices (Hypothesis 3).

# Discussion

Study 2 establishes that instructing negotiators to imagine attractive alternatives when they do not have any actual alternatives causes them to more ambitious first offers and that this may occur because of higher aspirations. Thus, this study demonstrates for the first time that actively imagining an alternative provides considerable benefits to negotiators who do not have an alternative.

#### Study 3: Negotiation Outcomes

The purpose of the third study was to examine not only whether mental simulation boosts negotiators' first offers but also whether this offer advantage translates into more profitable negotiation agreements. A second goal of Study 3 was to create a more realistic negotiation setting than in Study 2 by leading participants to believe that they actually had an alternative (or not) and were interacting with another individual rather than asking them to imagine this. To do so, we created a sequential negotiation paradigm whereby participants completed two negotiation rounds. The

<sup>2</sup> There was also a significant indirect effect when the strong alternatives condition was dropped and only the no alternatives and the imaginary alternatives conditions were compared, 95% CI [.8336, 3.797].

first negotiation round manipulated whether participants had an actual alternative or not because participants either received an attractive offer from a buyer (strong alternative condition) or were explicitly told that this buyer did not make them an offer (no alternative condition and imaginary alternative condition). Participants in the strong alternative condition could not accept their offer at this point and had to enter the second negotiation first. All participants were then told that they would negotiate with another buyer in a second negotiation round, in which we measured their performance. Before this second round started, participants in the imaginary alternative condition were asked to mentally simulate having an attractive alternative. Thus, participants were led to believe that they had an actual alternative or not and also that they were negotiating over the course of two rounds with two different buyers. The study procedure is illustrated in Figure 4. We predicted that negotiators who did not receive an alternative (i.e., those who did not receive an offer in the first negotiation round) but simulated an attractive alternative, would reach more profitable agreements in the second negotiation round than those who did not receive an alternative and did not engage in mental simulation. We further predicted that this effect would be mediated by the size of the first offer.

## Method

Participants and design. Participants were 154 individuals (mean age = 34.21; SD = 9.37; 48.1% female) recruited on

Amazon's Mechanical Turk in exchange for US\$1.50. Participants were randomly assigned to a strong alternative condition, a no alternative condition, and an imaginary alternative condition. We excluded duplicate IP addresses (N = 1), extreme values for first offers and outcomes (±3 SDs; N = 2), and participants who indicated that their (simulated) negotiation counterpart was not a real person (N = 2), resulting in a final sample of 149 participants.

Procedure and experimental manipulation. We took several steps to ensure that participants would perceive the negotiation as a real interaction with a real counterpart. First, the study was advertised as an interactive negotiation with other participants. Second, at the start of the study, participants entered a simulated online waiting room where a counter indicated the number of participants who were presumably waiting for the study to begin. After about 30 seconds, the counter indicated that 20 participants had arrived in the waiting room at which point the participants proceeded to the following page where they read their role instructions. Third, participants were informed that they would conduct multiple rounds of negotiations with different participants and were also asked to enter a screen name that would ostensibly be shown to their negotiation partners. They then entered another waiting room, where they were led to believe that they would be matched with their first opponent and randomly assigned to the seller or buyer role (in reality, all participants assumed the role of the seller).

Before entering their first negotiation, participants received seller-specific information. They were told that their task was to sell a Starbucks Logo Mug, that the average market price for such mugs was approximately \$5, and that even if the first buyer made them an offer that they would be willing to accept, they had to negotiate with the second buyer first before deciding on which offer to accept. The system then ostensibly selected either them or their opponent to make an initial offer. In reality, the simulated opponent in the first round always made the opening offer. In the strong alternative condition, the simulated opponents offered \$8 for the participants' mug, along with the following message: ""Hey. I'm interested in your mug and my offer for it is \$8.00. I'm unable to pay more than \$8.00. This is my final offer-take it or leave it!"" Participants in this condition could not accept this offer without

first going through the second negotiation. In the no alternative condition and the imaginary alternative condition, the simulated opponent made no offer: ""Hey. Unfortunately, I am unable to make you an offer for your mug. Sorry!"" (see Figure 4).

Participants were then told that the first negotiation had ended and that they would be randomly matched with a different opponent for their second negotiation. This time, all participants were led to believe that they were ""randomly"" selected to make the first offer. Before making a first offer, participants in the imaginary alternative condition were instructed to imagine having an attractive alternative using the same manipulation as in Study 2 (see Figure 4). Thereafter, all participants made a first offer to the simulated opponent. The opponent then made a counteroffer at a predetermined, increasing percentage of the participant's first offer. The participant could then choose to accept this offer or make a counteroffer. The negotiation opponent was programmed such that there would be a maximum of 10 negotiation rounds (each round including one offer and counteroffer).3 The counteroffer schedule also left open the possibility for negotiators to reach an impasse (six negotiations indeed ended with no agreement). The negotiation ended when (a) participants accepted their simulated opponent's offer, (b) participants' offers were lower than the simulated opponent's preprogrammed offer in the next round, or (c) after no offer had been accepted after 10 rounds.

### Dependent measures.

First offer and final agreement. We recorded participants first offer to the simulated buyer as well as their negotiation outcome in the second negotiation round.

Suspicion check. To further increase our confidence that participants believed that they interacted with real people, they were also asked to describe what their overall impressions of their opponents were. Our simulated negotiation setting was experienced as realistic because only two participants (1.3%) suspected that one or more of their opponents may not have been real.

Finally, participants reported demographic information and were debriefed.

Impasses. Six of the 149 participants did not reach an agreement; four in the strong alternative condition, one in the no alternative condition, and one in the imaginary alternative condition. Impasses did not significantly differ across conditions, x2(2, N = 149) = 3.23, p = . 20.

First offer. Consistent with Hypothesis 2, sellers in the imaginary alternatives condition made higher first offers (M = 8.27, SD = 5.62) than those in the no alternative condition (M = 6.56, SD = 2.21), t(140) = 2.40, p = . 018, d = . 41. Those with a strong alternative (M = 9.70, SD = 1.03) made higher first offers than those in the imaginary alternatives condition, t(140) = 1.95, p = .054, d = . 35, and higher first offers than those in the no alternatives condition, t(140) = 4.36, p < .001, d = 1.79 (see Figure 5).4

Final agreement. Consistent with Hypothesis 4, sellers in the imaginary alternatives condition negotiated better agreements (M = 5.44, SD = 3.57) than sellers in the no alternative condition (M = 4.34, SD = 1.70), t(140) = 2.26, p = .026, d = .40. Those with a strong alternative (M = 7.30, SD = 1.32) reached more profitable agreements than those in the imaginary alternatives condition, t(140) = 3.72, p < .001, d = .69, and those in the no

alternatives condition, t(140) = 6.03, p < . 001, d = 1.93 (see Figure 5).

Mediation analysis. We applied the same indicator coding procedure as in Study 2 to test whether first offers mediated the effect of imaging alternatives on final agreements. As predicted, the amount of the first offer made by the seller mediated the effect of imaginary alternatives on final agreements. A bootstrapping

<sup>3</sup> The counteroffer by the simulated opponent followed a logarithmic schedule with the first counteroffer reflecting 50% of the participant's first offer and the opponent's last (i.e., 10th) counteroffer reflecting 90% of the participant's first offer. The logarithmic counteroffer factor (.50, .62, .69, . . . , . 90) automatically rounded to the next tenth of a dollar (e.g., \$9.46 was rounded to \$9.50) to prevent suspicions that offers were calculated by a computer.

<sup>4</sup> These patterns did not change when we included impasse dyads. Those who imagined to have an alternative made higher first offers than those who had no alternative, t(146) = 2.42, p = . 017, d = . 40. Also, those with a strong alternative made higher first offers than those in the imaginary alternatives condition, t(146) = 2.00, p = . 047, d = . 35, and significantly higher first offers than those in the no alternatives condition, t(146) = 4.47, n < . 001. d = . 74.

procedure with 5,000 resamples confirmed a significant indirect effect, 95% CI [.2128, 4.060] (see Figure 6).5 These findings are consistent with the possibility that negotiators who simulated an attractive alternative (relative to those who had no alternative) may have achieved more advantageous final agreements because they made more ambitious offers (Hypothesis 5).

## Discussion

Study 3 replicates the positive effect of imaginary alternatives on first offers and finds similar patterns for final agreements. In addition, Study 3 used a sequential negotiation design where powerless negotiators more vividly experienced not having an alternative and thought that they would interact with other individuals.

#### Study 4: Face-to-Face Negotiation With Incentives

Study 4 improves upon the previous studies in a number of ways. Although Study 3 demonstrated that mental simulation can affect negotiation outcomes in a simulated interaction, there was no actual face-to-face contact between negotiators and their counterparts. Study 4 was therefore conducted in the laboratory and participants negotiated with a real opponent. Second, the stakes in Studies 1-3 were relatively low as negotiators' remuneration was not tied to their negotiation performance. However, past research has demonstrated that rewards may alter the dynamics of competitive social interactions (e.g., Kelley et al., 1970; Tenbrunsel, 1998) and moderate the influence of power differences on behavior more generally (for a review, see Schaerer et al., in press). In the current study, negotiators could therefore earn monetary rewards and/or keep the negotiation item, depending on their role and bargaining performance. Third, for the current study, we preregistered our predictions, sample size, and planned analyses on the Open Science Framework (OSF).6

### Method

Participants and design. Three hundred undergraduate and master's students (mean age = 23.08; SD = 3.47; 70.0% female) participated in a laboratory study in exchange for €5. Participants also had the opportunity to receive additional rewards contingent on their negotiation performance. We randomly assigned participants to 150 dyads and one of three experimental conditions: a strong alternative condition, a no alternative condition, or an imaginary alternatives condition. In line with the preregistration

protocol, we excluded one dyad that did not follow the instructions (i.e., incorrect first offer order) and three dyads that reported extreme values for the two numeric dependent measures (+/ -3SDs), leaving 146 dyads for our analyses.

Procedure and experimental manipulation. The negotiation task was similar to the one used in Study 3. Focal negotiators were assigned to the role of the seller and were tasked with selling a coffee mug to another person. In addition, sellers participated in two sequential negotiations with different counterparts, whereby the outcome of the first negotiation served as the alternatives manipulation for the second negotiation.

Upon arrival at the lab, participants were randomly assigned to seller and buyer roles and accompanied to isolated cubicles by the lab assistant. Buyers and sellers first read their role instructions in their individual cubicles. Sellers were informed that their task was to sell a coffee mug at the highest price possible, that they would negotiate with two potential buyers, and that they should sell the mug to the seller who is willing to pay the most. Buyers were told that they should buy the mug at the lowest price possible, but that they should not pay more than €10. Buyers only negotiated with one seller. All participants were also told that the prices for mugs like these typically range from €3 to €10, with an average price of around €5. In contrast to the previous studies, each negotiator also entered in a lottery with a 10% chance of earning an incentive based on their negotiation performance. Specifically, sellers could win the exact monetary amount for which they sold the mug to the buyer (e.g., if they won the lottery, a seller who sold the mug for €6 would receive €6). Buyers could win the mug plus the difference between the sales price and their reservation price of €10 (e.g., if they won the lottery, a buyer who bought the mug for €6 would receive the mug plus € 4).

After reading their role instructions, sellers were informed that they would receive a phone call from the first potential buyer (played by a male confederate) in their individual rooms. This first negotiation served as our alternatives manipulation (see Figure 7). Sellers in the strong alternative condition received a phone call from the confederate who offered them €8. They were told that they would first negotiate with a second buyer before deciding on whether to accept this offer, but that they could later fall back on this offer in case they could not reach a better deal in the second negotiation. Sellers in the no alternative condition and in the imaginary alternative condition also received a phone call from the confederate who indicated that he is not interested in the mug and would thus not be able to offer any money for the mug. After the call and still in their individual cubicles, sellers in the imaginary alternative condition completed a similar mental simulation exercise as in Studies 2 and 3. Specifically, they were asked to briefly describe what it would be like to have an attractive offer from another buyer, what this offer would look and feel like, and how it would affect their upcoming negotiation with the second buyer. Sellers in the other two conditions directly proceeded to the second negotiation (see Figure 7).

<sup>5</sup> There was also a significant indirect effect when the strong alternatives condition was simply dropped and only the no alternatives and the imaginary alternatives conditions were compared, 95% CI [.1044, 2.249].

Upon completion of the first negotiation, sellers were guided to a different room by the lab assistant where they encountered the second buyer (played by another participant). Sellers and buyers were seated at opposite ends of a table and instructed to negotiate the price of the coffee mug. Sellers opened the negotiation by making a first offer to the buyer.

Dependent measures. After the negotiation, both negotiators completed a short questionnaire in which they reported who made the first offer (to ensure that participants followed the instructions), what the first offer was, and what sales price (if any) they agreed on. First offers served as the mediating variable and final agreements as the dependent variable.

Participants then reported their demographics (e.g., gender, age), participated in the lottery by drawing a random ticket from a basket, and received their payment (as well as a bonus payment and/or a coffee mug if they won the lottery).

## Results

Impasses. One of the 146 dyads did not reach an agreement in the second negotiation. Impasses did not significantly differ across conditions, x2(2, N = 146) = 1.99, p = . 37.

First offer. Consistent with Hypothesis 2, sellers in the imaginary alternative condition made higher first offers (M = 9.62, SD = 3.25) than those in the no alternative condition (M = 7.80, SD = 1.77), t(142) = 3.95, p < . 001, d = . 70 (see Figure 8). Those with a strong alternative (M = 9.48, SD = 1.29) made significantly higher first offers than those in the no alternative condition, t(142) = 3.66, p < . 001, d = 1.09, but did not differ from those in the imaginary alternative condition, t(142) = . 31, p = . 76, d = - . 06.7

in the imaginary alternative condition, t(142) = 1.09, p = . 29, d = .21 (see Figure 8).

Mediation analysis. We used the same indicator coding procedure as in Studies 2 and 3 to test whether first offers mediated the effect of mental simulation on negotiation outcomes. As predicted, sellers' first offers mediated the effect of imaginary alternatives on final agreements. A bootstrapping procedure with 5,000 resamples confirmed a significant indirect effect, 95% CI [.2252, 4.9279] (see Figure 9).9 These findings are consistent with the possibility that negotiators who simulated an attractive alternative (vs. those who had no alternative) may have achieved more advantageous final agreements because they made more ambitious offers (Hypothesis 5).

## Discussion

Study 4 successfully replicates the effects found in the previous studies. In addition, Study 4 demonstrates that mental simulation continues to provide a distributive advantage in a setting where negotiators interacted with each other face-to-face and when negotiators' incentives were contingent on their performance at the bargaining table.

5 There was also a significant indirect effect when the strong alternatives condition was simply dropped and only the no alternative and the imaginary alternative conditions were compared, 95% CI [.1044, 2.249].

Final agreement. Consistent with Hypothesis 4, sellers in the imaginary alternative condition reached better agreements (M = 6.52, SD = 1.49) than sellers in the no alternative condition (M = 5.38, SD = 1.19), t(142) = 4.31, p < . 001, d = . 84. Those with a strong alternative (M = 6.80, SD = 1.17)8 reached more profitable agreements than those in the no alternative condition, t(142) = 5.42, p < .001, d = .1.20, but did not differ from those

<sup>7</sup> These patterns did not change when we included the dyad who reached an impasse. Those who imagined to have an alternative made higher first offers than those who had no alternative, t(143) = 3.88, p < . 001, d = . 68. Also, those with a strong alternative made higher first offers than those in the no alternatives condition, t(143) = 3.59, p < . 001, d = 1.05, but did not differ from those in the imaginary alternative condition, (143) = .31, p = 76, d = - 06.

<sup>8</sup> The fact that some of the sellers in the strong alternative condition reached a deal that was lower than the offer of the first buyer (8 euros) is likely a reflection of the fact that participants believed that they could fall back on their deal from their first negotiation if they reached a worse deal in the second negotiation. Furthermore, past research has documented that << a substantial portion of individuals [reach] an agreement that [is] inferior to their best alternative>> (p. 312) and that this occurs due to impasse aversion (Tuncel, Mislin, Kesebir, & Pinkley, 2016).

# Study 5: Simulating Attractive Versus Unattractive Alternatives

The purpose of the next study was to further examine the psychological mechanism by testing how mental simulation influences negotiators' thoughts and behavior. According to Epstude and Roese (2008), two pathways exist through which mental simulation can influence behavior. The content-specific pathway suggests that ""the particular information contained in the counterfactual (i.e., the lesson learned, or the belief in the causal effectiveness of a particular action) is funneled directly into a behavioral intention and, as a consequence, behavior"" (p. 171). Indeed, prior research has shown that upward mental simulation (e.g., thinking about how things could be better) is more likely to generate goal pursuit than downward simulation (e.g., thinking about how things could be worse; Epstude & Roese, 2008; Roese, 1994). The content-specific view is consistent with our reasoning that mentally simulating attractive alternatives causes negotiators to form more ambitious intentions (i.e., setting a higher aspiration price) which then translate into corresponding behavior (i.e., making more aggressive offers). According to this logic, simulating an unattractive alternative should not lead to better negotiation performance, as the latter counterfactual does not contain aspirationboosting information.

In contrast, the content-neutral pathway implies that mental simulation leads to ""the activation of a more general style of information processing, or motivation to expend greater effort that results in behavior change"" (Epstude & Roese, 2008, p. 171). In other words, mental simulation operates independently of the specific information contained in the counterfactual. For example, Galinsky and Moskowitz (2000) demonstrated that the consideration of counterfactual alternatives led to the activation of a ""counterfactual mindset"" and subsequently affected thought and behavior on unrelated tasks. If the effect of mental simulation on negotiators' aspirations and behavior is driven by changes in more generalized processing styles or motivations, then the simulation of unattractive alternatives should activate an equally strong counterfactual mindset as attractive alternatives and thus lead to higher ambitions and more profitable negotiation outcomes.

To test whether the effects documented in the previous studies are attributable to the specific information contained in the mental simulation or due to the activation of a ""counterfactual mindset,"" the present study instructed negotiators to simulate either an attractive or an unattractive alternative. Based on our theorizing, we predicted that simulating attractive alternatives would lead to better negotiation outcomes, whereas simulating unattractive alternatives would not.

A second purpose of Study 5 was to test a possible downside of mental simulation. It is possible that thinking about fictitious outside options may lead to reduced commitment to the focal negotiation and motivate opportunism (Malhotra & Gino, 2012). This is particularly problematic for powerless negotiators as it may cause them to forgo an opportunity on which they depend. Thus, we tested whether negotiators experienced different levels of commitment across the experimental conditions. A third goal of Study 5 was to test the complete causal chain in our theoretical model (see Figure 1) which proposed that the effect of mental simulation is sequentially mediated by negotiators' aspirations and their subsequent first offers.

## Method

Participants and design. We recruited 1,200 participants (mean age = 34.81; SD = 12.57; 55.8% female) from Amazon's Mechanical Turk in exchange for US\$1.00. Participants were randomly assigned to an attractive imaginary alternative condition,

an unattractive imaginary alternative condition, or a no mental simulation condition. As in Study 3, we excluded 31 participants because they took part twice (i.e., duplicate IP addresses; N = 4), because they reported extreme values for aspirations, first offers, and/or negotiation outcomes (±3 SDs, N = 20), and/or because they suspected that their (simulated) negotiation counterpart was not a real person (N = 7, 0.6%). The final sample consisted of 1,169 participants.

Procedure and experimental manipulation. The task was similar to the one used in Study 3. Participants assumed the role of a seller and completed two sequential negotiations with simulated buyers. However, in the current study, participants were instructed to sell an old car (rather than a coffee mug). They were given several pieces of information about the car such as model, color, purchase year, original price (\$23,000), and mileage. They were also told that a friend who is a car mechanic estimated the price at a maximum of \$2,500 and that a car pricing website placed the car value somewhere in the range of \$0 to \$2,000. Another difference to Study 3 was that in the current study the first negotiation always ended without a deal for the seller because the present design did not include a strong alternative condition. Thus, none of the participants had an alternative.

Before entering the second negotiation, participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions. Participants in the two treatment conditions were asked to mentally simulate having either an attractive or unattractive alternative. Specifically, participants in the attractive imaginary alternative conditions read:

Imagine yourself in a situation in which you have received a very attractive offer for your old car from another buyer. Imagine what this very attractive offer would look like, how it would feel like, and how it would affect your behavior in the upcoming negotiation with Chris [simulated buyer].

Participants in the unattractive imaginary alternative condition received identical instructions, except that the word ""attractive"" was replaced by ""unattractive"":

Imagine yourself in a situation in which you have received a very unattractive offer for your old car from another buyer. Imagine what this very unattractive offer would look like, how it would feel like, and how it would affect your behavior in the upcoming negotiation with Chris [simulated buyer].

Participants in the no mental simulation condition received no additional instructions and directly proceeded to the second negotiation.

#### Dependent measures.

Aspiration price. After completing the first negotiation (and mental simulation where applicable), sellers indicated their aspiration price. Aspiration price served as the first-stage mediator.

First offer. We recorded sellers' first offers to the simulated buyers in the second negotiation, which served as our second-stage mediator.

Final agreements. Final agreements were recorded at the end of the negotiation and served as our primary dependent measure.

Finally, participants completed the same suspicion check as in Study 3, reported demographic information, and were debriefed.

#### Results

Impasses. Nine of the 1,169 participants did not reach an agreement; five in the no alternative condition, two in the attractive imaginary alternatives condition, and two in the unattractive imaginary alternative condition. Impasses did not significantly differ across conditions, x2(2, N = 1,169) = 1.91, p = . 39. Because the purpose of this study was to examine the mediating effect on negotiation outcomes, we report aspiration and first offer data excluding participants who reached impasses. However, the predicted effects remain significant when impasses are included (all ps < . 05).

Aspiration price. Consistent with Hypothesis 1 and replicating the effect found in Study 2, negotiators who simulated an attractive alternative set higher aspiration prices (M = 2,361, SD = 867) than those who did not engage in mental simulation (M = 1,981, SD = 770), t(1,157) = 6.93, p < .001, d = .46. Negotiators who simulated unattractive alternatives, on the other hand, had lower aspirations (M = 1,753, SD = 627) than those who did not engage in mental simulation, t(1,157) = - 4.19, p < .001, d = - . 32.

First offer. Consistent with Hypothesis 2 and replicating Studies 2-4, negotiators who simulated an attractive alternative also made more ambitious first offers (M = 2,416, SD = 895) than those who did not engage in mental simulation (M = 2,080, SD = 821), t(1,157) = 5.83, p < . 001, d = . 39. In contrast, negotiators who simulated unattractive alternatives made lower first offers (M = 1,929, SD = 665) than those who did not engage in mental simulation, t(1,157) = - 2.64, p = . 008, d = - . 20.

Final agreements. Consistent with Hypothesis 4 and replicating Studies 3-4, negotiators in the attractive imaginary alternative condition achieved more profitable agreements (M = 1,622, SD = 638) than those who did not engage in mental simulation (M = 1,359, SD = 569), t(1,157) = 6.36, p < . 001, d = . 44. Negotiators who simulated unattractive alternatives, on the other hand, achieved lower outcomes (M = 1,272, SD = 507) than those who did not engage in mental simulation, t(1,157) = - 2.10, p = . 036, d = - . 16 (see Figure 10).

Mediation analysis. Next, we tested whether aspiration prices and first offers sequentially mediated the effect of the attractive imaginary alternatives manipulation on negotiation outcomes. As in the previous studies, we estimated the indirect effect of the attractive imaginary alternatives indicator (1 = attractive imaginary alternatives condition; 0 = all other conditions) while controlling for a second indicator (1 = unattractive imaginary alternatives condition; 0 = all other conditions).10 A bootstrapping procedure with 5,000 resamples and a 95% bias-corrected bootstrap confidence interval (Preacher & Hayes, 2004) confirmed that the indirect effect was significant, 95% CI [152.15, 291.57] (see Figure 11). These findings are consistent with the idea that negotiators who simulated an

Commitment. Sellers' commitment to the negotiation with the second buyer was measured by asking them to indicate ""How committed were you to your second negotiation?"" on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 7 (to a great extent).

<sup>10</sup> There was also a significant indirect effect when the unattractive imaginary alternative condition was dropped and only the no alternatives and the attractive imaginary alternative conditions were compared, 95% CI [156.09, 269.79].

attractive alternative (vs. those who had no alternative) may have achieved more advantageous final agreements because they first set more ambitious aspirations which then led them to make more demanding offers (Hypotheses 3 and 5).

Commitment. Finally, we also tested whether negotiators' commitment to the second negotiation would vary as a function of whether they simulated alternatives or not. There were no significant differences of commitment across the three conditions (all ps > .30).

## Discussion

Study 5 replicates the findings from the previous studies. More importantly, Study 5 tested the full serial mediation, which is consistent with the idea that simulating attractive alternatives may allow negotiators to reach better outcomes because it causes them to set higher aspirations that then translate into more ambitious first offers. Importantly, Study 5 also rules out the possibility that simply thinking about any alternative can lead to a distributive advantage. Negotiation outcomes only increased when negotiators mentally simulated an attractive alternative, but not when they simulated an unattractive one. Instead, mental simulation of an unattractive alternative resulted in lower aspirations, offers, and final agreements. This confirms our reasoning that mental simulation unfolds its effect by changing negotiators' behavioral intentions through specific information contained in the counterfactual (i.e., the content-specific pathway) rather than through differences in more general processing styles, or the activation of a ""counterfactual mindset"" (i.e., the content-neutral pathway). Finally, we found no evidence that mental simulation may cause negotiators to disengage from the subsequent negotiation and potentially lead to the loss of a valuable opportunity.

# Study 6: The Contingent Effects of First Offer Order and Simultaneous Mental Simulation

In the sixth study, we wanted to test the hypothesized effects of first offer order and simultaneous simulation. Specifically, we

predicted that mentally simulating attractive alternatives is most effective when the focal negotiator moves first and the opponent is not engaging in mental simulation, but less effective when the focal negotiator moves second and/or when the opponent also engages in mental simulation.

# Method

Participants and design. Participants were 514 professionals (mean age = 30.46; SD = 4.42; 38.2% female) pursuing a Master of Business Administration degree. The negotiation was part of an introductory leadership class in the first semester of the program. Participants completed the negotiation in dyads as part of their class preparations. Negotiators were randomly assigned to one of eight experimental cells of a 2 (focal negotiator: control vs. mental simulation) × 2 (opponent: control vs. mental simulation) × 2 (first mover: focal negotiator vs. opponent) between-subjects factorial design.11 As in the previous studies, we excluded extreme values (±3 SDs, N = 4) for our dependent measure of interest (i.e., final agreements). All of the dyads followed the instructed first offer order, resulting in a sample of 510 observations.

Procedure. Participants were randomly assigned to the role of a job candidate or a recruiter in a single-issue negotiation of a bonus payment (Galinsky & Mussweiler, 2001; Schaerer, Loschelder, et al., 2016). Both parties were told that they had already agreed on most terms of the job offer (salary, starting date, benefits), but that the signing bonus was yet to be discussed. Participants had five days to complete the negotiation over e-mail and were allowed to exchange as many e-mails as they wanted to.

## Experimental manipulation.

Imaginary alternatives manipulation. Participants in both the candidate and recruiter roles were randomly assigned to one of two alternatives conditions. Candidates [recruiters] in the control condition were told that they had secured a job offer at a comparable firm but without a signing bonus [they would not be able to hire any candidate if they did not reach an agreement]. Candidates [recruiters] in the mental simulation condition read the same information as those in the no bonus condition but were also instructed to complete a thought exercise:

Before starting the current bonus negotiation, imagine yourself in a situation in which you have already secured another comparable job offer but with a very high bonus from another company [you have the option to hire another comparable candidate for this position but for a very low bonus]. Imagine what this very high [low] bonus would look like, how it would make you feel, and how it would affect your upcoming bonus negotiation.

Both recruiters and candidates were also told that bonuses have averaged €12,000 in the past. Candidates were instructed that they should aim for a bonus as high as possible but that any bonus would be better than ending up with no agreement. Recruiters were instructed that they should pay as little as possible but that they

<sup>11</sup> Because in this study the negotiation was only about the bonus-aspect of the offer and we manipulated mental simulation for both sellers and buyers, we labeled the « no alternatives condition » as « control condition » (offer without bonus for candidate; no other candidate for recruiter) and the « imaginary alternative condition » as « mental simulation condition » instead.

would end up without a new recruit if they cannot settle on a bonus of less than €30,000.

First offer order. After reading their role materials, negotiators were instructed to initiate the negotiation by reaching out to their opponent with an offer or wait for their opponent to make a first offer, depending on their condition. In half of the dyads, candidates were instructed to move first, and in the other half of the dyads, recruiters moved first.

Dependent measure. Upon completion of the negotiation, dyads reported their negotiation outcomes to the course assistant.

### Results

110

Impasses. Of the 255 dyads in our sample, 18 dyads did not reach an agreement. None of the manipulations significantly predicted impasse likelihood (ps > .65) and there were no significant interaction effects (ps > .32), suggesting that impasses were about equally distributed across the experimental conditions. Because the purpose of the study was to examine the limiting effects of simultaneous mental simulation and first offer order on negotiation outcomes, dyads who reached an impasse were excluded from the analyses (see also Tripp & Sondak, 1992).

Final agreement. As the purpose of this study was to test the effects of the focal negotiators' mental simulation as a function of opponent behavior, we analyzed the data at the individual level. To account for the nesting of individual negotiators in dyads, we used a mixed model approach with dyad as the cluster variable. In addition, we controlled for role to make sure that any effects we find would be independent of whether negotiators took the role of seller or buyer (results did not change when role was excluded as a covariate). We also standardized the negotiation outcomes of sellers and buyers such that a higher z score indicates a better deal.

We hypothesized that the effects of mental simulation on negotiation outcomes would be weaker when the opponent moved first (Hypothesis 6) and when the opponent also engaged in mental simulation (Hypothesis 7). This is what we found (see Figure 12). There was a significant three-way interaction of the focal negotiator's mental simulation, the opponents mental simulation, and first offer order, F(1, 466) = 9.12, p = . 003. Follow-up contrasts showed that when focal negotiators moved first and their opponents did not engage in mental simulation, focal negotiators who engaged in mental simulation reached better negotiation outcomes (M = . 16, SD = . 93) than those who did not engage in mental simulation (M = - . 30, SD = 1.03), F(1, 466) = 6.84, p = . 009, d = . 47. However, this effect was no longer significant when opponents moved first (MNo = . 30, SDNo = 1.03; MImaginary =

.10, SD maginary = .95; F(1, 466) = 1.33, p = .25, d = .20), when opponents also engaged in mental simulation (MNo = - 10, SDNo = . 95; M Imaginary = - . 21, SD Imaginary = . 87; F(1, 466) = .45, p = .50, d = .13), or when opponents moved first and engaged in mental simulation (Mxs = = .06, SDNo = . 94; Mmaginary = . 21,
SD1maginary = .87; F(1, 466) = 2.47, p = . 12, d = . 30).12

## Discussion

Study 6 again replicated the effects of mental simulation on negotiation outcomes documented in the previous studies, but also uncovered additional boundary conditions of mental simulation. Negotiators no longer benefitted from mental simulation when their opponent moved first-likely because they were anchored by their opponents' first offer-and/or when their opponent simultaneously engaged in mental simulation-making it tougher for negotiators to translate their higher aspirations into more value claimed.

#### Study 7: When Mental Simulation Backfires

Across six studies we found that mental simulation of strong alternatives can lead to a distributive advantage by increasing powerless negotiators' aspirations and first offers when the focal negotiator makes the first offer and when their opponent does not engage in mental simulation. However, we also predicted that more ambitious negotiation behavior would create a roadblock to agreement when the dominant issue in the negotiation is difficult to reconcile for the parties involved. To test this final hypothesis, Study 7 examined the impact of mental simulation on agreement likelihood in a negotiation context where the bargaining zone was negative.

#### Method

Participants and procedure. Participants were the same Master of Business Administration students as in Study 1, but assigned to a different negotiation partner and a different interactive, face-to-face negotiation task. Sample size (N = 97) and

<sup>12</sup> Although the focus in this study was to examine the effects of mental simulation, opponent behavior, and first offer order on negotiation outcomes, we also found consistent results when we analyzed the effects of mental simulation and first offer order on first offers size. Engaging in mental simulation (vs. not) led to more ambitious offers (p < . 001) when focal negotiators moved first, but had no effect when the opponent moved first (p = . 64).

demographic characteristics (mean age = 29.24; SD = 2.19; 33.3% female) varied slightly compared with Study 1 because of differences in class attendance. Participants were randomly assigned to the role of the buyer or seller in the Les Florets negotiation (negotiationexercises.com), which involved the sale of a restaurant. The negotiation made it impossible to reach a deal based on sale price of the restaurant alone because it involved a negative bargaining zone such that the buyer's reservation price (the maximum he or she was authorized to pay) was lower than the seller's reservation price (the minimum he or she was willing to accept). Although the bargaining zone was negative for the sales price, the two parties had a common underlying interest that made agreement possible (although difficult). Specifically, the buyer wanted to hire a qualified manager to run the restaurant, and the seller needed a job upon return from a trip around the world. Thus, the two parties could agree to a sale price below the seller's reservation price as long as the buyer would provide future employment to the seller. However, reaching this deal was challenging because it required participants to discover this alternative solution during the negotiation process. Participants were given their confidential role instructions one week before the negotiation and were allowed 35 min to negotiate a deal in individual breakout rooms.

#### Measures.

Imaginary alternatives. Our independent variable was the same imaginary alternatives scale as in Study 1.

Impasses. The dependent variable measured whether negotiators declared an impasse (1) or reached a deal within the boundaries of the role instructions (0).

Control variables. As in Study 1, we controlled for selfreported strategic intentions, creativity, perceived power, the Big-5 personality traits, negotiator role, age, and gender. To account for within-dyad effects and rule out concerns over nonindependence of individual observations, we clustered negotiators in their respective dyads and controlled for it using a multilevel regression model.

# Results

We predicted that impasses would be more likely for negotiators who think more strongly about better alternatives. Sixty-eight percent of negotiations resulted in an impasse, confirming that it was difficult for negotiators to reach a deal without uncovering their mutual interests. Because the individual negotiators were nested in dyads and the dependent measure was dichotomous, we analyzed the data using multilevel General Linear Equations (GLE) model with a binomial distribution and logit link. Consistent with Hypothesis 8, we found that impasses were more likely the more negotiators reported to engage in mental simulation of alternatives, b = . 55, SE = . 18, Wald(1) = 9.49, p = . 002 (Model 1, Table 3). This effect remained robust when we included the control variables, b = . 84, SE = . 30, Wald(1) = 7.85, p = . 005 (Model 2, Table 3).

### Discussion

Study 7 supports our prediction that mentally simulating better alternatives not only facilitates claiming value, but also decreases the likelihood of an agreement when the negotiators' positions are difficult to reconcile. When negotiators face a negative bargaining zone, high aspirations and ambitious offers resulting from mental simulations hurt rather than help.

### Internal Meta-Analysis

To test the robustness of our effects and generate an effect size estimate free of publication bias, we conducted a meta-analysis

(e.g., Cumming, 2014) of the 5 experimental studies reported in this manuscript and an additional 8 studies not included in the current version of the manuscript (e.g., studies that were included in the original submission, underpowered or tested additional moderators). A fixed-effects meta-analysis comparing the average standardized mean difference between the baseline condition (no alternative) and the experimental condition (imaginary alternative) revealed a significant effect of mental simulation on aspiration prices, k = 6, d = .48, 95% CI [.38, .58], Z = 9.31, p < . 001, first offers, k = 13, d = . 41, 95% CI [.33, .49], Z = 10.11, p < . 001, and negotiation outcomes, k = 7, d = . 42, 95% CI [.32, .52], Z = 7.96, p < . 001. These findings speak to the robustness of the reported effect and corroborate the idea that simulating alternatives enables powerless negotiators to compete more effectively.

#### General Discussion

Practitioners, scholars, and people's lay perceptions all suggest that negotiators should obtain alternatives, because alternatives are the most important source of power in a negotiation. Despite the well-documented benefits of strong alternatives, negotiators are not always able to generate these. In fact, negotiators are often unable to obtain any alternatives at all, which causes them to lower their aspirations (Wong, 2014), decreases their willingness to negotiate (Magee et al., 2007), and results in less profitable agreements (Pinkley et al., 1994). Counter to this assumption, we proposed that powerless negotiators are not destined to fail and can still set higher aspirations, make more extreme first offers, and reach more profitable agreements when they simulate having attractive alternatives.

Across seven simulated and interactive negotiations conducted online, via e-mail, and face-to-face, we found that both measured and manipulated mental simulations of attractive alternatives can help negotiators overcome their disadvantaged position. Our stud-

ies provide compelling evidence for when and why the mental simulation of alternatives is desirable. First, we found that negotiators who have a tendency to simulate attractive alternatives also claimed more value on the distributive issues in an integrative negotiation (Study 1). Second, we found that these mental simulations led to higher aspirations (Studies 2 and 5) as well as more extreme first offers (Studies 2-5). Higher aspirations and more ambitious first offers in turn may have led to more profitable negotiation outcomes (Studies 3-6), but only when the simulated alternative was attractive (Study 5) and when negotiators moved first and their opponent did not simultaneously engage in mental simulation (Study 6). Importantly, our final study (Study 7) showed that the aspiration-boosting effect of imaginary alternatives could also hurt when negotiators' positions are already difficult to reconcile.

## Theoretical Contributions

Competing effectively from a position of powerlessness. The present research makes important contributions to the literature on social power (e.g., Anderson & Brion, 2014; Galinsky, Rucker, & Magee, 2015) by answering a call for more research on powerlessness (e.g., Kopelman, Hardin, Myers, & Tost, 2016). Past power studies have primarily been concerned with investigating the cognitive, motivational, and behavioral implications of being powerful but have neglected to more thoroughly examine the psychology of being powerless (Schaerer, du Plessis, et al., 2016). The present studies extend this research by illuminating the mechanisms that allow powerless individuals to reap some of the benefits that power provides in mixed-motive interactions. These findings also align with a growing body of work (e.g., Mishra, Barclay, & Lalumière, 2014; Pitesa & Thau, 2013; Zitek, Jordan, Monin, & Leach, 2010) investigating the psychological experiences associated with being powerless and identifying ways in which the disadvantaged negotiate hierarchical differences. Our studies suggest that the mental imagery of what it would be like to be in a better position can be a powerful way for powerless individuals to compete more effectively.

Reaping the cognitive benefits of real alternatives. In addition, the present research advances our understanding of the influence of alternatives on negotiator cognition and behavior. Specifically, it shows that some of the benefits that alternatives provide can also be achieved through different means. Research on power and negotiations assumes that alternatives are a prerequisite to negotiating successfully (Kim et al., 2005; Magee et al., 2007; Pinkley, 1995; Pinkley et al., 1994; Thompson et al., 2010). That is, actual alternatives are perceived as an instrument that enables negotiators to exercise pressure on their opponents and that serves as a safety net that protects against a bad deal. Yet, more recent research has begun to highlight the dual nature of alternatives: strong alternatives not only provide leverage, but also serve as salient anchors that cause negotiators to make more ambitious first offers (Schaerer et al., 2015). Thus, alternatives offer both power and cognitive benefits. According to this logic, negotiators need not have actual alternatives to reap the cognitive benefits that strong alternatives provide. The present studies are consistent with this insight by showing that negotiators can generate their own ambitious aspiration prices through mental simulations, which eventually translate into higher offers and more profitable agreements when negotiators' interests overlap. Thus, negotiators can act more powerfully without having power.

One question directly emerging from this discussion is whether simulated alternatives are as effective as real alternatives. Although our studies have shown that engaging in mental simulation (vs. not) can lead to substantial improvements in negotiation outcomes, there are certain benefits of having real alternatives that mental simulation cannot replace. For example, having a strong alternative allows negotiators to make a credible threat about leaving the negotiation table if their expectations are not met by the opponent. Although negotiators who mentally simulate alternatives may still be able to make such threats (e.g., by bluffing; see also Shalvi, Dana, Handgraaf, & De Dreu, 2011), doing so can backfire if an opponent tries to verify the validity of such threats. In addition, merely simulating an alternative may reduce negotiators' motivation to generate actual alternatives. Thus, despite the considerable benefits of mental simulation, negotiators should always try to obtain a strong alternative first, and only engage in mental simulation as a complimentary measure.

Mental simulation in interdependent contexts. The present research also contributes to existing theoretical perspectives on the social psychology of mental simulations in competitive interactions and illustrates the boundary conditions in interdependent settings. First, our findings extend the functional view of counterfactual thinking (e.g., Epstude & Roese, 2008) by providing a clear example of how counterfactual thoughts increase economic gains in mixed-motive interactions. We also extend research on the link between counterfactuals and negotiation behavior (Kray et al., 2009), which has contrasted the strength of different types of counterfactual thinking with each other (i.e., additive vs. subtractive counterfactuals) by examining reflections about past negotiation. However, this research did not show whether mental imagery could result in economic advantages over baseline participants. The present studies show that it does.

Second, our research provides evidence for a novel mechanism through which mental simulations affect negotiations. Prior research has primarily argued that counterfactual reflections allow negotiators to learn from their past experiences and negotiate more effectively as a result (Kray et al., 2009; Wong et al., 2012). The current studies extend these findings by uncovering a cognitive, aspiration-based route through which counterfactual thoughts may influence behavioral outcomes. The comparison of mentally simulating attractive versus unattractive alternatives (Study 5) revealed that the type of information that is simulated matters and that simply simulating any alternative is not sufficient to generate a distributive advantage. In doing so, our studies provide support for the content-specific pathway of mental simulation (Epstude & Roese, 2008) and rule out the alternative explanation that mental simulation simply led to more general differences in negotiators' processing style, or a ""counterfactual mindset.""

Finally, the present studies are among the first to show the boundary conditions of mental simulation in the context of interdependence. Past research has primarily studied the effects of mental simulation on individuals' thoughts and behavior without systematically taking into consideration the broader social context (for reviews, see Epstude & Roese, 2008; Roese, 1997). Extending this research, our studies show that when one's outcomes are diametrically opposed to those of another individual, mental simulation is no longer effective when both individuals use this strategy or when one does not have the opportunity to move first (Study 6). Moreover, Study 7 showed that mental simulation can even backfire. When the situation makes it hard for two negotiators to reconcile their preferences and positional behavior is not useful as a primary strategy, mental simulation may pose a roadblock to agreement.

# Strengths, Limitations, and Future Directions

The present research has a number of strengths. First, in examining the influence of imaginary alternatives on negotiator cognition, behavior, and outcomes, we systematically replicated our effect across various studies including scenarios, simulations, laboratory experiments, and negotiations between experienced professionals. This not only enabled us to establish the existence of the effect, but also allowed us to demonstrate the generalizability of the distributive advantages mental simulations can have across a wide range of negotiations. Second, we conducted an internal meta-analysis including the file-drawer to provide both a more precise (i.e., narrower confidence intervals) and a more accurate (i.e., free of publication bias) estimate of the effect. In doing so, we not only demonstrate the robustness of our findings but also respond to a call for more meta-analytic research and unlocking the file-drawer (Cumming, 2014; Franco, Malhotra, & Simonovits, 2014) to provide more conservative effect size estimates (Ioannidis, 2008). Third, we go beyond prior research on power and negotiation by manipulating the presence of alternatives through a sequential study design (see Studies 3-5) in which the outcome of a first negotiation serves as the power manipulation for a second negotiation and thus provides a more vivid and realistic experience of having or lacking an alternative. Past research has primarily provided information about alternatives through artificial point systems presented in the task materials (Galinsky & Mussweiler, 2001; Pinkley, 1995; Pinkley et al., 1994). To further increase the external validity of our findings, we also provided real incentives and rewarded negotiators financially depending on their performance (Study 5). In doing so, we answer a call for systematically taking into account organizational realities into experimental social power research (Schaerer et al., in press).

The current research also has limitations that provide exciting opportunities for future research. First, a potential downside of boosting one's aspirations through mentally simulating attractive alternatives could be that it lowers satisfaction with the negotiation outcome. Evaluations are often contrastive (Kahneman, 1992) and so whether a particular outcome is perceived as a gain or loss depends on a reference point's relative position. Individuals who compare their outcomes with a low reference point tend to be more satisfied than those who compare their outcome to a high reference point (Galinsky, Mussweiler, & Medvec, 2002; Medvec, Madey, & Gilovich, 1995; Medvec & Savitsky, 1997). Thus, negotiators who mentally simulate aspirational alternatives may end up feeling less satisfied about a financially better outcome. Because negotiators tend to care strongly about both objective and subjective outcomes (Curhan, Elfenbein, & Xu, 2006), future research could investigate whether negotiators would prefer an objectively better, but less satisfying, outcome over an objectively less attractive, but more satisfying outcome, and how this would affect their propensity to engage in mental simulation.

Second, our findings may appear to be at odds with other research suggesting that contrasting one's own position with a higher standard, or reference point, can be ego-deflating and thus have a negative effect on aspirations (e.g., Collins, 1996). However, Lockwood and Kunda (1997) suggest that a critical factor that determines whether ""high"" reference points lead to selfenhancement or self-deflation is the extent to which those reference points are attainable. Reference points tend to have positive effects on aspirations when they are within the realm of the possible, but negative effects when they are unattainable (Lockwood & Kunda, 1997). Thus, it is likely that the negotiators in our studies simulated alternatives that they considered as attainable, which, in turn, had a positive effect on their aspirations and negotiation outcomes. Future research may test whether explicitly instructing negotiators to simulate unrealistically high alternatives may attenuate the distributive advantage documented in the present research.

Third, Studies 1 and 7 were correlational in nature and thus do not allow us to make causal claims about the effects of mental simulation on negotiation performance. Although we demonstrated the divergent validity of the scale measuring the propensity to engage in mental simulation and controlled for a variety of alternative explanations, it is possible that other constructs may affect both mental simulation and changes in negotiation performance. Nevertheless, the fact that mental simulation positively predicted negotiation performance on the distributive issues (Study 1) and at the same time negatively predicted the likelihood of finding an agreement when the bargaining zone was negative (Study 7) provides indirect support for our conclusions. We encourage future research to more systematically compare and contrast individual differences in the propensity to engage in mental simulation versus spontaneous mental simulation, as well as the contexts in which they might differentially affect behavior.

Fourth, the present research primarily focused on a type of mental simulation that can improve negotiators' individual outcomes. However, mental simulation may also be a fruitful way to promote integrative behavior and cooperative attitudes. For example, mental simulation has been shown to increase information sharing in groups (Galinsky & Kray, 2004) and may even promote more positive perceptions in intergroup interactions (Crisp & Turner, 2009). Future research may test whether mental simulation can help negotiators to maximize their joint profit instead of their individual profit. For example, simulating how negotiation attributes are malleable (vs. fixed) may lead to a reduction in fixed-pie perceptions (Thompson & Hastie, 1990), one of the major reasons why negotiators fail to realize integrative potential. Future research may also find ways to combine the two, such that mental simulation not only leads to better individual gains but simultaneously maximizes joint gains.

Finally, in studying powerlessness in negotiations, we chose to focus on the most extreme case of powerlessness in which negotiators lack an alternative altogether. However, sometimes negotiators have little power not because they lack an alternative but because their alternative is very unattractive (e.g., a low-ball offer from another buyer). Although we did not test our hypotheses in the context of weak alternatives, we believe that mental simulation should still be effective in such cases. We noted earlier that lacking alternatives lowers negotiators' aspirations, confidence, and willingness to negotiate (e.g., Magee et al., 2007; Wong, 2014) and that mental simulation helps improve aspirations. Recent research suggests that weak alternatives can also have a detrimental effect on negotiators' ambitiousness, as weak alternatives serve as low anchors that ""weigh down"" negotiators' aspirations and first offers (Schaerer et al., 2015). In addition, we believe more research is needed to better understand the differences between having a weak or no alternative. For example, although receiving unemployment benefits is at least in theory-a viable alternative for job candidates without any other offers, people may not consider it as an alternative and see themselves as having no power at all. Whether negotiators include alternatives in their choice set may depend on factors such as informational relevance and similarity between the potential alternative and the issue to be negotiated.

# Conclusion

Although there is little doubt that strong alternatives are key to bargaining success, more often than not, negotiators come to the negotiation table without an alternative. The studies reported here, however, suggest that the mental imagery of an attractive alternative can still afford negotiators a distributive advantage and compensate for some of the ambitiousness that strong alternatives typically provide. Mental simulation proved to be a subtle way for negotiators to escape their powerless situations when there was sufficient room for more ambitious offers to translate into more profitable agreements, but may not be effective when counterparts do the same, make the first offer, or when negotiators' positions are difficult to reconcile.
