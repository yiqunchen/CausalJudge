Cumulative Childhood Trauma, Emotion Regulation, Dissociation, and Behavior Problems in School-Aged Sexual Abuse Victims

#### Abstract

Background: Child sexual abuse is associated with a plethora of devastating repercussions. A significant number of sexually abused children are likely to experience other forms of maltreatment that can seriously affect their emotion regulation abilities and impede on their development. The aims of the study were test emotion regulation and dissociation as mediators in the association between cumulative childhood trauma and internalized and externalized behavior problems in children victims of sexual abuse.

Methods: Participants were 309 sexually abused children (203 girls and 106 boys; Mean age = 9.07) and their non-offending parent. Medical and clinical files were coded for cumulative childhood trauma. At initial evaluation (T1), parents completed measures assessing the children's emotion regulation abilities and dissociation. At Time 2, parents completed a measure assessing children's behavior problems. Mediation analyses were conducted with emotion regulation and dissociation as sequential mediators using Mplus software.

Results: Findings revealed that cumulative childhood trauma affects both internalized and externalized behavior problems through three mediation paths: emotion regulation alone, dissociation alone, and through a path combining emotion regulation and dissociation.

Limitations: Both emotion regulation and dissociation were assessed at Time 1 and thus the temporal sequencing of mediators remains to be ascertained through a longitudinal design. All measures were completed by the parents.

Conclusions: Clinicians should routinely screen for other childhood trauma in vulnerable clienteles. In order to tackle behavior problems, clinical interventions for sexually abused youth need to address emotion regulation competencies and dissociation.

Cumulative Childhood Trauma and Behavior Problems: The Mediating Effect of Emotion Regulation and Dissociation

#### Introduction

Child sexual abuse (CSA) affects one out of five women and one out of ten men worldwide (Stoltenborgh et al., 2011). This highly prevalent social problem is associated with an array of long-term psychological, physical, and behavioral problems such as depression, suicidal ideations and attempts, substance dependence, posttraumatic stress disorder, sexual risk behaviors, and increased use of healthcare for physical health problems (Fergusson et al., 2013). While the last decades have seen major developments in research investigating long-term consequences of CSA among adults, studies of short-term correlates among children have been sparser, resulting in significant gaps in the scientific literature. Available studies indicate that sexually abused children are at higher risk of presenting a plethora of difficulties compared to non-abused children and even to children having sustained other forms of maltreatment (i.e., physical or emotional abuse, neglect), including behavior problems (Lewis et al., 2016; Maniglio, 2015), posttraumatic stress and dissociation symptoms (Hébert et al., 2016), as well as emotional dysregulation (Langevin et al., 2016; Shipman et al., 2000). Given the detrimental impacts of CSA on multiple aspects of child development, it is essential to further our understanding of the associated consequences of CSA with children samples and explore the possible mechanisms linking CSA to negative outcomes.

#### Cumulative Childhood Trauma

Although CSA alone is sufficient to produce major dysfunctions, synergistic effects of cumulative childhood adversity - meaning that the interaction between two or more adverse experiences produces a greater combined effect than the sum of the individual effects - have

#### Running head: CCT, ER, DISSOCIATION, AND BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS 5

been uncovered with adult samples in empirical studies (Putnam et al., 2013). Indeed, Putnam and colleagues found that the presence of four or more childhood adversities was associated with increased risk of presenting complex adult psychopathology. Furthermore, synergistic effects were found with specific combinations of trauma, several of which involved CSA (Putnam et al., 2013). Recently, a longitudinal study investigating adult functioning of survivors of childhood abuse and neglect found that exposure to a greater number of early adversities was associated with fewer years of education, higher levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms, and increased criminal arrests in adulthood (Horan & Widom, 2015). Number of trauma types also appears to be positively associated with dissociative symptoms in adults (Briere, 2006).

A study using a nationally representative sample of youth in the U.S. identified the occurrence of multiple trauma as a frequent phenomenon (Turner et al., 2015). According to this study, 21.3% of youth aged 10-17 years old have been victimized at school and at home, while 17.8% of them experienced polyvictimization (i.e., victimization occurring in multiple settings and involving multiple perpetrators). Polyvictimized children presented the worst outcomes in terms of delinquency and trauma symptom scores (Turner et al., 2015). Number of trauma types experienced was also associated with self-reported and caregiver-reported symptom complexity (i.e., clinical elevations in a variety of symptom clusters) in a clinical sample of school-aged children (Hodges et al., 2013). Finally, a study of sexually abused children found that cumulative childhood trauma was positively associated with emotional dysregulation and internalized and externalized behavior problems (Choi & Oh, 2014). Overall, studies tend to indicate that cumulative childhood trauma leads to more severe behavioral and psychological consequences than single experiences of trauma, both in adults and youth samples.

#### Emotion Regulation and Dissociation

#### Running head: CCT, ER, DISSOCIATION, AND BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS 6

Emotion regulation difficulties and dissociative symptoms have been documented as potential consequences associated with CSA and cumulative childhood trauma in children and adults. While the two concepts of emotion regulation and dissociation are often studied separately, there are conceptual and empirical associations between them. Some authors view dissociation as a regulatory strategy falling in the category of over-modulation or over-regulation of emotions (Bennett et al., 2015; Lanius et al., 2010), while others perceive it as the consequence of failed emotion regulation attempts (Kalill, 2013; Chaplo et al., 2015). Ford (2013) advocates for a vision of dissociation as a biologically based self-regulatory response to extreme emotions. He suggests that fostering self-regulation abilities is essential to the treatment of dissociation. Dissociation was also conceptualized as an avoidance strategy used to face emotions that overwhelm internal affect regulation capacities following a trauma (Briere et al., 2010). Therefore, while some scholars view dissociation as an emotion regulation strategy, more experts in the field tend to see it as a result of deficits in the ability to effectively self-regulate intense emotions. Thus, deficits in the area of emotion regulation are hypothesized to precede the occurrence of dissociation symptoms. \_

Consistent with this idea, empirical studies found that emotional dysregulation predicted dissociative symptomatology in trauma-exposed adults and sexually abused youth offenders (Briere, 2006; Chaplo et al., 2015; Power et al., 2015). In a sample of maltreated teenagers, emotional dysregulation was found to predict dissociation symptoms over and beyond the forms of maltreatment experienced, the number of perpetrators involved, as well as the age of onset (Sundermann & DePrince, 2015). Another study with an adult sample found that affect dysregulation mediated the effect of cumulative interpersonal trauma on dysfunctional avoidance (i.e., dissociation, tension reduction behaviors, substance abuse, and suicidality) (Briere et al.,

#### Running head: CCT, ER, DISSOCIATION, AND BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS 7

2010). In trauma-exposed youth offenders, higher levels of emotional dysregulation - including both over and under-regulation of emotional arousal – were found in individuals presenting high levels of dissociation, when compared to those presenting low levels of dissociation. In sum, coherent with theoretical models, a number of empirical reports indicate that emotional dysregulation might predict dissociation levels in traumatized adults and adolescents. However, no available study, that we are aware of, has investigated these associations in a children sample.

#### Mediational Analysis with Emotion Regulation and Dissociation

To understand how variables are associated with each other, mediation and moderation analyses are indicated (Hayes, 2013). A number of past mediation and moderation studies investigated the patterns of associations among maltreatment, emotion regulation, and mental health outcomes. Eisenberg and Morris (2002) offered a conceptualization of self-regulation, including emotional self-regulation, involving three styles of control: overcontrol, undercontrol and optimal control. Overcontrolled children are thought to exert excessive control over their emotions and behaviors, and are therefore at-risk for developing internalizing problems. On the other hand, undercontrolled children tend to be less able to regulate themselves effortfully and are therefore at-risk for developing externalizing problems (Eisenberg et al., 2013). This conceptualization highlights the theoretical associations between emotion regulation and behavior problems. ~

Empirical findings tend to confirm this association. A study involving a sample of young adults found that emotional dysregulation mediated the association between high-betrayal trauma (i.e., abuse perpetrated by a close individual, as opposed to abuse perpetrated by a stranger or trauma that are not caused by another human being) and various mental health symptoms including anxiety, depression, intrusions, and avoidance (Goldsmith et al., 2013). Emotion

regulation was also found to mediate the association between maltreatment and internalized and externalized behavior problems in school-age samples (Alink et al., 2009; Kim-Spoon et al., 2013). In one of these studies, the mediation effect was only found in insecurely attached children (Alink et al., 2009). In another study of school-age children, emotion regulation mediated the association between cumulative childhood trauma and internalized and externalized behavior problems in sexually abused children (Choi & Ho, 2014). Finally, a study indicated that, even in the preschool period, emotion regulation mediated the association between CSA and parental reports of child behavior problems (Langevin et al., 2015).

The association between dissociation and behavior problems has been less studied in maltreated children samples. However, a recent study showed that internalized behavior problems were associated with dissociation over and beyond the effects of maternal dissociation and depression/anxiety, number of traumatic events, and child gender in a sample of preschool children (Hagan et al., 2015). Kisiel and Lyons (2001) found that dissociation mediated the association between CSA and behavior problems in children aged 10-18 years old. Furthermore, dissociation was found to mediate the relationships between CSA and a number of mental health symptoms (i.e., depression, somatization, compulsive behavior, phobic symptoms, and borderline personality disorder) in a clinical sample of women (Ross-Gower et al., 1998). Berthelot et al. (2012) also found that dissociation mediated the association between CSA and internalized and externalized behavior problems in their sample of children aged 2 to 12 years old. They suggested that dissociation predicts the onset of behavior problems because it prevents the integration, resolution, and mentalization of the traumatic event. As a result, sexually abused children might be kept in a state of powerlessness and confusion favoring the emergence of behavioral difficulties (Berthelot et al., 2012). Overall, past studies tend to indicate that emotion
# Running head: CCT, ER, DISSOCIATION, AND BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS 9

regulation and dissociation symptoms explain, at least partially, the associations between traumatic events and mental health and behavioral problems in various samples of children and adults.

Against this backdrop, this study aims to further our understanding of CSA associated consequences in childhood by testing two mediation models investigating the relationships among cumulative childhood trauma, emotion regulation, and internalized and externalized behavior problems in a sample of sexually abused school-aged children. Figure 1 illustrates the hypothesized mediation model. Even though the two mediators were measured concurrently, we suggest a sequence where emotion regulation deficits precede dissociation symptoms based on previous theoretical and empirical works described earlier.

#### Methods

#### Participants

The sample consisted of 309 sexually abused children (203 girls, 106 boys) aged 6-12 years old (M= 9.07, SD = 2.17) and their non-offending parent (85.8% maternal figure, 9.6% father figure, 4.6% other known adult). Exclusion criteria were to not speak French or English and/or the presence of a developmental delay preventing from understanding the questionnaires. Children were recruited in five intervention centers offering services to abused children and their parents in the BLIND FOR REVIEW]. Time 1 assessment was conducted in the intervention settings and Time 2 assessment (5 months later) was conducted at the centers or at the home of the participants. A total of 21.9% of children lived in their family of origin, the remaining lived in single-parent families (32.1%), stepfamilies (25.5%), or foster families (20.5%). Maternal education level corresponded to elementary school (2.8%), high school diploma (38.8%) or the

# Running head: CCT, ER, DISSOCIATION, AND BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS 10

equivalent of 12 to 14 years (41.3%), while 17.1% completed an undergraduate or graduate level. Close to half of families (52.3%) reported an annual income level of less than 40,000\$ (CAN).

#### Measures

Cumulative childhood trauma. Data regarding children's victimization history were gathered through various means in order to ensure a comprehensive assessment. Medical/clinical files were analyzed and data regarding past situations of CSA, physical abuse, psychological abuse, exposure to family violence, and neglect were coded using a modified version of the History of Victimization Form (HVF; Wolfe et al., 1987) and the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children (K-SADS; Kaufman et al., 1997). Data from the Revised Conflict Tactics Scale (Straus et al., 1996) completed by parents were also used to assess exposure to family violence. A continuous cumulative childhood trauma score ranging from 0 to 5 was derived from these data. Zero meant that, to our knowledge, the children only experienced the CSA event that brought him/her to the intervention center. Children with scores ranging from 1 to 5 had experienced 1 to 5 additional victimization experiences (i.e., another CSA situation, physical abuse, psychological abuse, neglect, and/or exposure to family violence). See Figure 2 for detailed distribution.

Emotion regulation. At Time 1, emotion regulation was assessed using parent reports on the 24-item Emotion Regulation Checklist (ERC; Shields & Cicchetti, 1997; French version: Langevin et al., 2010) a widely-used questionnaire known to discriminate between wellregulated and dysregulated children (Shields et al., 2001). The ERC measures emotional lability, intensity, flexibility, and situational appropriateness. Sample items include ""is easily frustrated"", ""is impulsive"", ""is a cheerful child"", and ""is able to delay gratification"". Parents were invited to

# Running head: CCT, ER, DISSOCIATION, AND BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS 11

rate their children's behaviors in general with a Likert-scale ranging from 0 (never) to 3 (almost always). A total score of emotion regulation, ranging from 0 to 72, was calculated by reversing negatively weighted items and summing the scores on each item. A higher score reflects better emotion regulation competencies. In the present study, internal consistency for the total score was high (α = .84).

Dissociation. At Time 1, parents reported on the dissociation level of their children using the Child Dissociative Checklist (CDC; Putnam et al., 1993; French version: Hébert & Parent, 2000), a 20-item measure. The CDC is a well-renown measure of dissociation in children, and the reliability and validity of the scale was demonstrated by Putnam and his colleagues (1993). Sample items include ""Child shows rapid changes in personality"", and ""Child has difficult time learning from experience, e.g. explanations, normal discipline or punishment do not change his or her behavior"". Parents were invited to rate their children's behavior on a three-point Likertscale (0 = not true to 2 = very true). A total score ranging from 0-40 was obtained by summing scores on every item. In this study, internal consistency for the total score was adequate (α = .80).

Behavior problems. At Time 2, children's behavior problems were assessed using parent reports on the Child Behavior Checklist - School-Age Version (CBCL; Achenbach & Rescorla, 2001). The CBCL is a widely-used 113-item measure of behavior problems from which two global subscales can be derived: internalized behavior problems (32 items) and externalized behavior problems (35 items). The internalized behavior subscale includes items related to anxiety/depression (13 items), social withdrawal/depression (8 items), and somatic complaints (11 items), while the externalized behavior subscale includes items related to antisocial behaviors (17 items) and aggression (18 items). Parents were invited to rate their children's

# Running head: CCT, ER, DISSOCIATION, AND BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS 12

behaviors in the past two months on a three-point Likert-scale (0 = never true to 2 = often or always true). T-scores were derived from parents' answers. Psychometric qualities of this questionnaire were demonstrated by Achenbach and Rescorla (2001). In this study, internal consistencies of the internalized behavior problems and externalized behavior problems subscales were high (a = . 87 and .92 respectively).

## Procedure

Children and their parents were recruited in five intervention centers in [BLIND FOR REVIEW]. Both parent and child informed written consent were obtained, and the questionnaires were completed at the intervention centers. A small financial compensation was offered to parents and a gift certificate to children. This research project was approved by the [BLIND FOR REVIEW].

#### Results

### Data Analysis

In order to determine how cumulative childhood trauma affects internalized and externalized behavior problems, mediation analyses were conducted with emotion regulation and dissociation as sequential mediators using Mplus software, v.7.31. A multiple mediator model based on the product of coefficients approach was selected as an appropriate method to test the hypotheses (Preacher & Hayes, 2008). Bootstrapping method (Shrout & Bolger, 2002) was used for testing the significance of the specific indirect effects. This technique has been advocated as preferable to causal steps approach (Baron & Kenny, 1986) for testing the indirect effects (MacKinnon et al., 2002, 2004; Preacher & Hayes, 2004). The principle of bootstrapping method consists of drawing a large number (10,000 in this study) of resamples with replacement, from the observed dataset, and then estimate the total and the specific indirect effects within each

# Running head: CCT, ER, DISSOCIATION, AND BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS 13

bootstrap sample. These estimates are in turn used to construct bias-corrected confidence intervals for the indirect effects. An indirect effect is said to be statistically significant when its corresponding bias-corrected confidence interval does not include zero. Missing data were treated with full information maximum likelihood estimation (FIML) implemented in Mplus (Muthén & Muthén, 2015).

## Correlation between variables

Pearson's correlations were performed using SPSS 22 in order to examine the strength of the association among study variables. Table 1 presents the means, standard deviations and correlation between the variables. Results revealed a significant, medium, negative correlation between emotion regulation and the two variables measuring behavior problems. Correlation between emotion regulation and dissociation was significant, negative, and high. Dissociation showed a high positive correlation with internalized behavior problems and a medium positive correlation with externalized behavior problems. The correlation between internalized and externalized behavior problems was significant, positive and high. Cumulative childhood trauma showed a significant, low, positive correlation with both dissociation and externalized behavior problems. Correlation between cumulative childhood trauma and emotion regulation was also significant and low, but negative. Results indicated a non-significant correlation between cumulative childhood trauma and internalized behavior problems and between age and all other study variables.

#### Mediation Analyses

The first mediation analysis explored the relationship between cumulative childhood trauma and internalized behavior problems in the presence of the two sequential mediators. As

presented in Table 2, cumulative childhood trauma was significantly associated with both emotion regulation (ß = - 1.10, p < 0.05) and dissociation (ß = 0.51, p < 0.05), but not with internalized behavior problems when controlled for the mediators (ß = -0.55, p = 0.26). Emotion regulation and dissociation were both related with internalized behavior problems (ß = -0.14, p < 0.05 and ß = 0.86, p < 0.001, respectively). The results also showed that emotion regulation was significantly associated with dissociation (ß = - 0.31, p < 0.001). These results suggest that cumulative childhood trauma has an indirect effect on internalized behavior problems through its association with emotion regulation and dissociation.

The second mediation analysis showed similar results for the relationship between cumulative childhood trauma and externalized behavior problems. As presented in Table 2, both emotion regulation and dissociation had a significant effect on externalized behavior problems (β = - 0.26, p < 0.01 and ß = 0.56, p < 0.001, respectively). The direct effect of cumulative childhood trauma on externalized behavior problems was not significant once controlled for emotion regulation and dissociation (8 = 0.55, p = 0.25), suggesting a full mediation effect for externalized behavior problems.

The models explained 26% of the variance of internalized behavior problems and 25% of the variance of externalized behavior problems.

Figure 3 illustrates the different paths of influence of cumulative childhood trauma on behavior problems and Table 3 displays the estimation results of indirect effects of cumulative childhood trauma on internalized and externalized behavior problems through the two mediators. Results revealed that cumulative childhood trauma affects internalized behavior problems through three mediation paths: through emotion regulation alone (0.15, CI [0.02, 0.39]), through

# Running head: CCT, ER, DISSOCIATION, AND BEHA VIOR PROBLEMS 15

dissociation alone (0.44, CI [0.17, 0.77]), and through the path containing the two mediators (0.29, CI [0.12, 0.54]). The numbers in brackets refer to the estimated indirect effects and their corresponding 95% bias-corrected confidence intervals. The total indirect effect of cumulative childhood trauma on internalized behavior problems through emotion regulation and dissociation was significant (0.89, CI [0.50, 1.33]). Results also showed a total indirect effect of cumulative childhood trauma on externalized behavior problems via the two mediator variables (0.77, CI [0.42, 1.20]). Here again, the three specific indirect effects were significant: (0.29, CI [0.09, 0.63]) for the specific indirect effect passing via emotion regulation, (0.28, [0.11, 0.56]) for the specific indirect effect passing via dissociation and (0.19, [0.08, 0.39]) for the specific indirect effect passing via both emotion regulation and dissociation.

A multi-group analysis was conducted to test for possible difference between girls and boys in the two mediation models. A chi-square difference test was used to compare the model where parameters were constrained to equality across sex with the model where parameters were allowed to differ across sex. When the chi-square statistic is non-significant, the constrained model is preferable and the two sex groups do not differ. The chi-square difference test results showed no difference between girls and boys in the first and the second mediation model (AX = 7.62, p = 0.38; △x2 = 11.29, p = 0.13, respectively).

#### Discussion

The aim of this study was to examine the possible mediation effect of emotion regulation and dissociation in the relationships between cumulative childhood trauma and internalized and externalized behavior problems in a sample of school-aged CSA victims. In line with our

# Running head: CCT, ER, DISSOCIATION, AND BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS 16

hypotheses and with results of past studies, cumulative childhood trauma was associated with higher levels of emotional dysregulation, dissociation, and behavior problems (Briere, 2006; Choi & Oh, 2014; Hodges et al., 2015; Horan & Widom, 2015). Furthermore, descriptive analyses revealed CSA rarely occurs alone. Coherent with past studies (Turner et al., 2015), our data suggest that 75% of sexually abused children experienced at least one other form of child maltreatment and close to one out of five children experienced three other forms of maltreatment apart from the CSA. These findings underline the relevance of studying the negative outcomes associated with cumulative childhood trauma in sexually abused children.

Furthermore, multiple mediation paths were found. Cumulative childhood trauma was found to be indirectly associated with internalized behavior problems via its effect on emotion regulation, the association between emotion regulation and dissociation, and the effect of dissociation on internalized behavior problems. The same was true for externalized behavior problems. Although emotion regulation and dissociation were measured concurrently, the significant direct effect of emotion regulation on dissociation and the indirect paths including both mediators provide support to previous conceptual and empirical reports suggesting that dissociation could be the result of failed emotion regulation attempts (Chaplo et al., 2015; Kalill, 2013; Sundermann & DePrince, 2015). In addition, the direct and indirect paths identified confirmed the hypothesized associations between emotion regulation, and behavior problems. Nonetheless, the sequence identified needs to be interpreted with caution.

Our results are in line with those of Choi and Oh (2014), but they also further our understanding of the associations between cumulative childhood trauma and behavior problems by including dissociation symptoms into the models tested. While the association between dissociation and behavior problems was less documented than the link with emotion regulation,

# Running head: CCT, ER, DISSOCIATION, AND BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS 17

our results converge with those of Hagan et al. (2015), Kisiel and Lyons (2001), and Ross-Gower et al. (1998), showing that this is a relevant variable to explore when aiming to understand the mechanisms linking cumulative childhood trauma and behavior problems in childhood.

Finally, when emotion regulation and dissociation were accounted for, the effect of cumulative childhood trauma on externalized behavior problems became non-significant, pointing to a complete mediation effect of these variables. Regarding internalized behavior problems, three indirect paths starting with cumulative childhood trauma and including these variables were significant. These results highlight that emotion regulation and dissociation appears to play a major role in the relations between cumulative childhood trauma and behavior problems in our school-age sample. These findings, if replicated, has significant implications for practice.

#### Implications and contributions

While our findings still need replication, especially with non-concurrent measures of emotion regulation and dissociation, important clinical implications can be derived. Cumulative childhood trauma, emotion regulation, dissociation, and behavior problems should be routinely assessed when sexually abused children consult for treatment. Parent-report validated questionnaires, like those used in this study, are easily available and could provide useful information. Psychiatrists and mental health practitioners should be aware of the patterns of association between study's variables in order to elaborate efficient treatment plans. To reduce behavior problems, professionals might need to specifically address emotion regulation competencies and dissociation using targeted therapeutic strategies (e.g., emotion awareness skills, emotion understanding skills, empathy skills, grounding strategies, dissociation-focused
# Running head: CCT, ER, DISSOCIATION, AND BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS 18

interventions) (Silberg, 2014; Southam-Gerow, 2013). Emotion regulation appears to be of particular relevance.

### Limitations

Research implications can also be derived from this study and are directly related with its limitations. The two mediators of interest (emotion regulation and dissociation) were both assessed at Time 1. While previous findings and theoretical models advocate for a direction of the effect where emotion regulation deficits precede dissociation symptoms, the cross-sectional nature of the relation between these two variables in the present study does not allow to draw such a conclusion. Therefore, it could be argued that dissociation symptoms might predict emotion regulation deficits. In line with this hypothesis, Hulette (2011) found that dissociation predicted alexithymia and difficulty describing feelings in adults, two constructs related to emotion regulation. On the other hand, Kalill's results (2013) tend to indicate that the relation between emotion regulation and dissociation could be bidirectional. Indeed, emotion regulation was found to mediate the association between peritraumatic dissociation and later dissociation in young adults. Clearly, more studies are needed to be able to confirm the sequence of associations between emotion regulation and dissociation, and only longitudinal designs could achieve such an objective.

Another limitation is that all measures were derived from parent-reports, while it is now recognized that a multi-informant, multi-method approach is ideal in developmental studies. It would be essential to replicate our findings using self-report measures, as well as measures derived from parents, mental health practitioners, and/or teachers. Observational measures could also be used to strengthen the design. While no gender effect were found in the current models, it is still possible that some CSA correlates unfold or evolve differently in boys and girls over the

## Running head: CCT, ER, DISSOCIATION, AND BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS 19

course of longer periods of assessment. For example, the evolution of emotion regulation deficits and dissociation symptoms were found to be gender related in preschool victims of CSA over one year (Bernier et al., 2013; Langevin et al., 2015; Séguin-Lemire et al., 2016).

In conclusion, this study provides meaningful information regarding the short-term correlates of CSA and cumulative childhood trauma in school-age children. Emotion regulation in particular, but also dissociation, appear to be key factors in the well-established association between trauma and later behavior problems. Future studies should pursue this line of investigation to procure valuable knowledge for practitioners working with traumatized children. This enhanced understanding of traumatic dynamics could be useful to foster resilience in children that were, unfortunately, exposed to horrifying events before even reaching adolescence.

## Abstract

The glutamic acid decarboxylase 1 (GAD1) gene is a major determinant of y-Aminobutyric acid (GABA), the most abundant inhibitory neurotransmitter modulating local neuronal circuitry. GABAergic dysfunction and expression of GAD1 have been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, and in working memory impairment. We examined the influence of the functional GADI rs3749034 variant on white matter fractional anisotropy (FA), cortical thickness, and working memory performance in schizophrenia patients and healthy controls (N=197). Using transcranial magnetic stimulation with electroencephalography (TMS-EEG), we subsequently examined the effect of rs3749034 on long-interval cortical inhibition (LICI) in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in schizophrenia patients and healthy controls (N=66). We found that the rs3749034 T-allele carrier risk group had lower voxel-wise FA in prefrontal cortex region (PFWE-corrected (0.05) but not cortical thickness. Mixed-model regression revealed a significant effect on attentional processing and working memory across four performance measures (F1.182=11.5, p=8x10""). FA in the prefrontal cortex was associated with digit-span performance. Voxel-wise mediation analysis revealed that the effect GAD1 on poorer digit-span performance statistically predicted the lower white matter FA (PFWE-orrected <0.05). In exploratory analysis, we found a prominent GADI genotype-by-diagnosis interaction on DLPFC LICI (F1.56=14.3, p=4.1x10 ). Our findings converge on variation in GADI gene predicting a susceptibility mechanism that affects white matter FA, GABAergic inhibitory neurotransmission in the DLPFC, and working memory performance. Furthermore, via voxel mediation of FA and TMS-EEG intervention, we provide evidence for a potentially causal mechanism through which aberrant DLPFC GABA signaling may contribute to working memory dysfunction.

## Introduction

Working memory dysfunction is a central feature of schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders. In patients with schizophrenia, working memory deficits are associated with dysfunction of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) connectivity, and disruption of neurotransmitter input such as y-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) inhibitory neurotransmission (Lewis et al, 2012). There is a genetic contribution to working memory dysfunction. Unaffected co-twins of schizophrenia patients perform significantly worse than controls on spatial and verbal working memory tasks (Pirkola et al, 2005). For example, the letter-number-sequencing task (LNS; a measure of working memory) has been identified as an endophenotype of schizophrenia with a moderately high heritability (h2=0.39) (Greenwood et al, 2007).

Heritability studies have also demonstrated that prefrontal and temporal gray matter volumes are strongly influenced by genetics factors in comparison to other regions of the cortex (Thompson et al, 2001). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) heritability studies generally reported the greatest impact of genetic factors on fractional anisotropy (FA) in cingulate gyrus, uncinate fasciculi, and the corpus callosum (Kochunov et al, 2014). Together, this suggests that the working memory functioning is mediated, in part, by genetic factors driving brain structure and function. However, it could be argued that imaging-genetics studies of working memory are intrinsically correlational, showing only associations among genetic variants, brain structure and cognitive performance (Kanai and Rees, 2011). To date, few studies have examined if the genetic contribution to working memory is mediated by brain structure (Aarts et al, 2010; Green et al, 2013; Klumpers et al, 2014), and none have examined whole brain relationships.

One method that may resolve the causal relationship among genes, brain structure and working memory performance is transcranial magnetic stimulation with electroencephalography (TMS-3 Tristram A. Lett

EEG). Combined TMS-EEG applied over the DLPFC can be used to measure the effects of GABAergic inhibitory neurotransmission on neural oscillations and synchrony that are thought to be integral to higher order cognitive function including working memory (Daskalakis et al, 2008; Lett et al, 2014; McClintock et al, 2011). Paired-pulse cortical stimulation can elicit cortical inhibition or facilitation that is suggested to underlie neurotransmission at the synapse. In particular, long-interval cortical inhibition (LICI) has been linked to metabotropic GABAB receptor transmission (Deisz, 1999; McDonnell et al, 2006). DLPFC LICI has been correlated with performance on the N-back (r=0.63), LNS (r=0.68), and Sternberg (accuracy: r=0.58; reaction time: r=0.48) working memory tasks in healthy controls (Daskalakis et al, 2008; Hoppenbrouwers et al, 2012; Rogasch et al, 2014). Therefore, DLPFC LICI may represent an important mechanism linking GABAergic inhibitory neurotransmission and working memory performance.

Convergent evidence suggests a compelling role for the glutamate decarboxylase 1 (GADI) gene in GABAergic neurotransmission as it relates to working memory. GADI codes for the glutamic acid decarboxylase (GADG) enzyme that metabolizes glutamate to GABA and is responsible for the production of the majority of GABA in the brain (Lewis et al, 2005), although activityinduced GABA synthesis has been shown to be induced by GAD65 (Patel et al, 2006). Downregulation of GAD67 in the parvalbumin-positive (PV) interneurons of the DLFPC is a well-replicated postmortem finding in schizophrenia (Torrey et al, 2005). In the mouse PFC, GADo deficits in the parvalbumin interneurons have been causally linked to inhibitory transmission and network disinhibition (Lazarus et al, 2013). Given the linkage disequilibrium structure of GADI, the rs3749034 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) covers a large proportion of the variance in the promoter/5' region; rs3749034 has been associated with

Tristram A. Lett

downregulation of GAD67 in the DLPFC as well as the progressive switch from GAD25 to GAD67 expression and KCC2 to NKCC1 expression (Hyde et al, 2011; Straub et al, 2007). This switch is thought to be the hallmark of the shift from GABA excitatory function to inhibitory function underlying synaptic wiring and refinement of local neuronal circuits (Ben-Ari et al, 2012). Furthermore, a 5 '-promoter SNP in linkage disequilibrium with rs3749034 is associated with variation in working memory performance and DLPFC function in vivo (Straub et al, 2007). Therefore, the GAD1 rs3749034 SNP may reflect changes in cortical connectivity and local inhibitory circuits that are involved in working memory performance.

In the present study, we set out to provide convergent evidence that the relationship between GADI and working memory performance may be mediated by brain structural connectivity and DLPFC inhibitory neurotransmission. Since GADI is expressed ubiquitously expressed across the cortex, we examined whole brain associations of cortical thickness and white matter FA connecting these cortical regions. Further, it is unclear if GAD1 would predict specific working memory domains or general executive functioning. Therefore, we tested associations among the GADI promoter variant rs3749034 neurocognitive tasks spanning attention in addition to verbal and non-verbal components of working memory. Using LICI, we explored the association among the rs3749034 SNP and DLPFC cortical inhibition.

## Materials and Methods

#### Participants

Two independent samples were examined. Participants for both the imaging-genetics sample and the TMS-EEG sample were recruited under separate study protocols approved by the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) in Toronto, Canada in accordance with the Declaration in Tristram A. Lett 5

Helsinki. All participants were identified as Caucasian based on self-reported ethnicity of three out of four grandparents. They were administered the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Disorders (First MB, 1995), and were interviewed by a psychiatrist to ensure diagnostic accuracy. Individuals with previous head trauma with loss of consciousness, neurological disorders, current or past substance and a history of a primary psychotic disorder in first-degree relatives were excluded.

For the imaging-genetics sample, all clinical assessments occurred at CAMH while T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) scans were performed at a nearby general hospital. Eighty patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 115 healthy control subjects in this sample completed all imaging and genetics protocols; three healthy controls did not complete DW-MRI protocols. Seventy patients and 121 healthy controls completed cognitive testing, and genetics protocols. IQ was measured using the Wechsler Test for Adult Reading (WTAR) (Wechsler, 2001) and all participants were screened with the Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE) for dementia (Folstein et al, 1975) and a urine toxicology screen. The Hand Dominance Questionnaire was used to examine handedness. Comorbid physical illness burden was measured by administration of the Clinical Information Rating Scale for Geriatrics (CIRS-G) (Miller et al, 1992). All subjects underwent a battery of cognitive test that been previously described (Voineskos et al, 2012). See supplement 1 for detail on the assessment of working memory.

For the TMS-EEG sample, all clinical assessments and TMS-EEG recordings occurred at CAMH. The sample has been described previously (Radhu et al, 2015). For the purpose of this study, only participants of Caucasian ethnicity were included in the analysis resulting in 33 healthy control and 23 patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder with Tristram A. Lett 6

completed TMS-EEG and genetics protocols. Exclusion criteria established by international safety standards for TMS were followed (Rossi et al, 2009). The TMS adult Safety Screen was administered to all subjects (Keel et al, 2001).

## Genetics

Genotyping of the rs3749034 variant (GADI) was performed using a standard ABI (Applied Biosystems Inc.) 5' nuclease Taqman assay-on-demand protocol in a total volume of 10 µL. Postamplification products were analyzed on the ABI 7500 Sequence Detection System (ABI, Foster City, California, USA) and genotype calls were performed manually. Results were verified independently by laboratory personnel blind to demographic and phenotypic information. Genotyping accuracy was assessed by repeating 10% of the sample with 100% accordance in all genotype calls.

### Image Acquisition

High-resolution axial inversion recovery-prepared spoiled gradient recall MR images were acquired using a 1.5-T GE Echospeed system (General Electric Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI; echo time (TE): 5.3 ms, repetition time (TR): 12.3 ms, time to inversion: 300 ms, flip angle 20, number of excitations=1; 124 contiguous images, 1.5 mm thickness). For DW-MRI acquisition, a single-shot spin-echo planar sequence was used with diffusion gradients applied in 23 non-collinear directions, b=1000 s/mm², and two b=0 images. Fifty-seven slices were acquired for whole-brain coverage oblique to the axial plane (2.6 mm isotropic voxels; field of view was 330 mm, 128 × 128 mm2 acquisition matrix; TE=85.5 ms, TR=15 000 ms; the sequence was repeated three times to improve signal-to-noise ratio). Quality control for each raw diffusion-weighted scan was conducted manually by an experienced operator prior to inclusion 7 Tristram A. Lett

of the images into the research study. Each scan was visually inspected for artifacts or motion including: horizontal stripes, checker effects, inter-slice intensity. Cortical thickness mapping and tract-based spatial statistics are explain in detail in Supplement 1, methods and materials.

#### Cluster-based measure of long-interval cortical inhibition

LICI was assessed among all electrodes at frequencies ranging from 1-50 Hz. Cluster-based analysis has been previously described in detail in this sample (Garcia Dominguez et al, 2014; Radhu et al, 2015), and based on analyses described by Maris and Oostenveld (Maris and Oostenveld, 2007). Clusters are defined in a time-frequency-space domain, a 4-dimensional entity, since space is the two dimensional grid of electrodes plus one dimension for time and another for frequency. Cortical inhibition was assessed at every time-frequency-spatial value using a one-tailed, paired t-test testing if the single-pulse condition was significantly greater than the paired-pulse stimulation. The significant threshold was set at a<0.01 after 10,000 permutations of trials from the two conditions, paired and single pulse. The number of significant voxels within the biggest cluster of inhibition was calculated for every subject, and it was determined as the degree of LICI after stimulation to the DLPFC. This measure of DLPFC LICI was left-skewed, therefore we applied a log transformation. See Supplement 1 for detail on localization of the DLPFC for TMS-EEG, LICI assessment, EEG recording and processing.

## Statistics

Given the low frequency of the TT genotype, these cases were grouped with CT genotypes and referred to as 'T allele carriers' for all statistical tests (Table S1). Analyses were performed examining the relationship between GADI genotype group (C allele homozygotes or T allele 8 Tristram A. Lett

carriers) for cognitive performance, brain morphology and DLPFC LICI. Adherence to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and case-control allelic frequency association (using x) were determined using Haploview 4.2.

Differences in demographic characteristics between healthy controls and schizophrenia patients were assessed by independent t-tests for continuous variables and x2 tests for count variables using SPSS (Version 21). For cortical thickness and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) analyzes, we examined a diagnosis by GADI genotype interaction, and main effects of diagnosis and genotype on the FA skeleton with age and sex as covariates. A false discovery rate (FDR) correction of q=0.05 was applied for cortical thickness, and a family-wise error (FWE) rate of 5% for white matter FA comparisons. Multiple comparison corrections were performed within each analytic imaging modality.

To determine potential confounders of working memory, we first evaluated if age, sex, IQ, and three measures of education (participant, father, mother) were predictors of task performance (LNS, digit-span) in healthy controls or schizophrenia patients via the linear mixed model. Task performance scores were the within-subject variable. GAD1 genotype, diagnosis, and their interaction were the between-subject factors. Follow-up analysis was done using the general linear model (GLM). Covariates of no interests were only included in our model if they were below a significance threshold of p = 0.1. The influence of GADI as a predictor of cognitive performance, diagnosis, and their interaction was then analyzed via the GLM with our covariates of no interest. Four GLMs were performed with LNS score, Digit-Span, Stroop (Time/Item), and Stroop ratio. Associations were deemed significant at P=0.05 after Bonferroni correction for four comparisons.
#### Voxel-wise mediation analysis

Mediation was assessed at each FA voxel from the TBSS skeleton. GAD1 rs3749034 genotype was the independent variable, neurocognitive performance was the dependent variable, and each FA voxel was the mediator. Age, sex, and diagnosis were included as covariates. Significant mediation was assessed via the Sobel Z statistic at each voxel creating a TBSS skeleton map of Sobel Z statistics that then under-went threshold-free clustering enhancement (TFCE). Significant after family-wise correction was assessed by maximum whole skeleton TFCE value from 10000 permutations (randomization). See Supplement 1 for a detailed description of the voxel-wise mediation analysis.

### Results

#### Participants

There was no significant deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for the rs3749034 genotype (p=1; Table S1). The rs3749034 minor allele frequency of the healthy controls (0.22) was similar to Hapmap CEU population (0.18; Hapmap Build #27) (Gibbs et al, 2003). The frequency of the rs3749034 T allele was significantly greater in schizophrenia patients (0.29) than controls (0.22, x =3.8, p=0.05), and the association is in the same direction as the most recent findings from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (T risk allele; p=0.007)(Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics, 2014). For both samples, age, sex, and handedness were not significantly different between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls (p>0.05). In the imaging-genetics sample, patients had lower IQ, education, and highest level of education of either parent (p<0.05; Table 1).

#### Association between GAD1 and brain structure

We found no effect of genotype or genotype by diagnosis interaction at any cortical thickness vertex after covarying for age and using FDR correction of 5%. We found a significant main effect in which T allele risk carries were associated with lower FA, predominately in the prefrontal cortex including the genu of the corpus callosum (PrwE-corrected>0.05; Figure S1). There was no significant GADI genotype-by-diagnosis interaction on FA after correcting for FWE.

### Association between GAD1 and neurocognitive performance

We included age and IQ as covariates of no interest in our analyses since they were significantly associated with our working memory outcome measures (Digit-Span and LNS) in schizophrenia patients and healthy controls (p<0.05). Sex and education were not associated with digit-span forward or LNS performance in either patients or controls (p>0.1); therefore, they were not included in as covariates. In a linear mixed model, we included performance of our four cognitive measures (digit-span forward, LNS, Stroop time/item, Stroop Ratio) as within-subject variables because of the correlation among these performance scores in healthy controls and schizophrenia patients (Supplementary Table S3).

There was a significant between-subject effect of GAD1 genotype (F1.182=11.5, p=8 x 10+), but no significant genotype-by-diagnosis interaction (F1,182-2.3, p=0.13). Further, there was a significant within-subject effect (task-by-genotype) association with GADI genotype (p=0.03). Follow-up analyses in each task revealed a significant effect of GADI on digit-span forward performance (F1.188 = 7=8.0, p=0.005) and a nominally significant effect on the LNS task performance (F1188 = 5.0, p=0.026), after covarying for subject age and IQ. There also was a Tristram A. Lett 11

significant association with Stroop ratio (F11188=7.0, p=0.009), but not time per item. No significant GADI genotype-by-diagnosis interaction was observed for any cognitive task (Table 2, Supplementary Figure S2).

#### Voxel-wise mediation analysis

Since there was a significant association between main effect of GADI risk genotype and white matter FA as well as working memory, we employed voxel-wise mediation analysis across all subjects. For mediation to occur, we first needed to establish if white matter FA predicted working memory performance (corrected for IQ). Voxel-wise analysis of the TBSS skeleton revealed higher FA was associated with better digit-span forward performance after covarying for the effect of age, particularly in the corpus callosum and the right superior longitudinal fasciculus (PFWE-corected 0.05; Figure S3). FA did not predict LNS performance or Stroop ratio after correcting for family-wise error; therefore, we did not perform any mediation analyses for these tasks. White matter skeleton FA mediated the association between GAD1 risk genotype and digit-span performance, particularly in the prefrontal and right inferior parietal regions, suggesting that lower FA in this regions is statistically causing poorer digit-span performance (PFWE-corrected<0.05; Figure 2).

#### Long-interval cortical inhibition

In the TMS-EEG sample, GAD1 genotype and diagnosis were not associated with DLPFC LICI cluster size (GADI genotype: F156=0.6, p= 0.43; diagnosis: F1.56=1.7, p=0.20); however, we found a prominent GADI genotype-by-diagnosis interaction explaining 22% of the variance in LICI DLPFC cluster size (R2=0.22, F156=13.5, p=4.2x104; Figure 3). Given the significant genotype-by-diagnosis interaction we examined the association between GAD1 and LICI cluster Tristram A. Lett 12

size separately in healthy controls and patients with schizophrenia. In healthy controls, GADI risk genotype predicted greater DLPFC LICI cluster size (R2-0.25, F1.33=10.1, p=0.003). In contrast, GAD1 risk genotype was associated with lower DLPFC LICI cluster size in patients with schizophrenia (R2=0.19, F1.23=5.4, p=0.04).

#### Discussion

We have provided evidence that the GAD1 rs3749034 risk variant is associated with lower white matter FA that may be related to poor working memory performance and frontal executive functioning that is independent of diagnosis. Carriers of the GADI risk allele had poorer working memory, and lower white matter FA in the prefrontal cortices. Furthermore, our exploratory analysis indicates that the GAD1 risk variant differentially predicts DLPFC LICI depending on diagnosis. Last, white matter FA positively correlates with digit-span performance independent of diagnosis, and we could statistically infer a causal relationship via white matter FA mediates the effect on GAD1 on digit-span performance.

To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to examine the effect of rs3749034 genotype on white matter FA. Our finding that T-allele risk carriers predicted lower FA, predominately in the genu of the corpus callosum, is consistent with the literature on top-down modulation of posterior brain regions during inhibition and attention tasks (Hopfinger et al, 2000). The T-allele was also associated with worse performance on both the working memory tasks and the Stroop reaction time. This may suggest that the effect of GADI genotype may be acting on general frontal executive function rather than working memory specifically. This is bolstered by the association of genotype with prefrontal FA, and is line with the concept that genetic variation can delineate brain structure or function that is common among multiple cognitive functions.

Furthermore, we found the effect of rs3749034 on FA and working memory performance was consistent across diagnostic groups. This suggests that genotypic variation in GADI acts as a modifier of brain structure and related cognitive function. GAD1 may explain some of the heterogeneity of brain structure and cognitive function reported within schizophrenia, despite the potential confounders within disease. While our vertex-wise analysis did not replicate previous association between the GADI risk variant and the left parahippocampus (Brauns et al, 2013), our exploratory analysis revealed that the GADI risk variant may be associated with temporal lobe cortical thickness although the effects may be modest. Replication is necessary to confirm the association.

This study is also the first to examine the effect of genetic variation on DLPFC LICI. Our exploratory TMS-EEG analysis yielded an unexpected result. In healthy controls, GADI T allele carriers had greater LICI cluster size in contrast to schizophrenia patients in which T allele carriers had lower cluster size. One speculative explanation could be that in healthy controls, T allele carriers have less efficient LICI and need to incorporate more cortical areas to achieve the same inhibition. In contrast, schizophrenia patients may have reduced prefrontal connectivity, and the T allele carriers are unable to elicit a LICI response to wider area. The link between disrupted GABA synthesis and GABAB receptor function, which is primarily measured by LICI, is not completely elucidated yet. Furthermore, the association among GADI genotype and LICI may be reliant on other neurotransmitter systems disrupted in schizophrenia. GABAA receptor neurotransmission generates a tonic conductance, in addition to phasic activations, suggesting that LICI may also index efficient GABAA receptor functioning (Farrant and Nusser, 2005). Additionally, in vivo NDMA receptor agonist treatment leads to reduced GAD1 expression suggesting upstream control of inhibition (Lisman et al, 2008). GABAx receptor and NMDA

receptor abnormalities observed in schizophrenia could explain the opposite effect of GADI genotype on LICI cluster size in healthy controls and schizophrenia patients (Akbarian et al, 1995; Uhlhaas and Singer, 2010). However, it is important to be remain cautious about these interpretations given the exploratory nature of the analysis.

Our finding may have clinical implications in the treatment of working memory dysfunction in schizophrenia. Currently, there are no currently approved treatments that are clinically effective although some preclinical studies have shown effects of brain stimulation. For example, it has been reported that bilateral rTMS treatment to the DLPFC might improve working memory performance in schizophrenia patients (Barr et al, 2013). Also, long-term rTMS treatment was associated with increased prefrontal white matter FA (Allendorfer et al, 2012; Peng et al, 2012). Cortical inhibition has been suggested to explain the lasting effects of rTMS (Daskalakis et al, 2006; Funke and Benali, 2011). Therefore, GADY genotype could predict a direct mechanistic link between rTMS treatment and DLPFC LICI. Furthermore, cognitive remediation therapy (CRT) may ameliorate working memory dysfunction in schizophrenia. Considering our associations among GADI, prefrontal cortex white matter FA, DLPFC LICI, and working memory, it could be speculated that GAD1 rs3749034 genotype may be an important genetic predictor of adjunctive treatments such as rTMS. GADI rs3749034 genotype may be a potential confounder in future treatment trials, and therefore, segregating subjects by genotype may improve trial outcome.

This study has a number of limitations. Even though we found a significant association between rs3749034 and schizophrenia, evidence for association between GADI common variants and schizophrenia is relatively weak with no reported genome-wide significant findings. However, there is strong evidence for disruption of GADI expression in schizophrenia. Our a priori Tristram A. Lett 15

hypothesis was that GADI is an important modifier of the disease process, and we selected the rs3749034 based on its known effect on GAD1 expression. That is, we sought to indirectly model for how altered GADI expression may lead to neuroanatomical, neurophysiological, and neurocognitive differences. Since the minor allele frequency of the rs3749034 variant is relatively low, for statistical analysis we inferred a dominant model by grouping minor allele risk homozygotes and heterozygotes. We limited our analysis only to Caucasian subjects; therefore, we are unable to assess the effect of GADI in other ethnic groups. There were differences in the education level of the parents as well as in IQ between groups which may limit the generalizability for our results. Moreover, the exploratory LICI analysis was performed in a small sample for genetic analysis and subjects were not assessed for working memory performance. Thus, we could not directly assess the relationship among GAD1, LICI, and working memory. Correlations between LICI and working memory has been independently replicated in three healthy control samples (Daskalakis et al, 2008; Hoppenbrouwers et al, 2012; Rogasch et al, 2014). However, this relationship has not been assessed in patients with schizophrenia, and as such our results may help inform molecular or neurophysiologicallyinformed treatment translation efforts to enhance cognitive performance based on GADI genotype.

Working memory dysfunction is one of the most intractable symptoms of schizophrenia, with severe consequences on functional outcome (Lett et al, 2014). We have provided evidence that GADI may mediate lower working memory function via changes in white matter FA in the prefrontal cortex, and LICI after DLPFC stimulation. Thus, GADI on brain structure and function may explain some of the heterogeneity in working memory dysfunction. In addition, our

results suggest a genetic relationship between inhibitory signaling and working memory dysfunction among healthy individuals and schizophrenia patients.

Do boys produce more terms than girls to describe the spatial world-that is, dimensional adjectives (e.g., big, little, tall, short), shape terms (e.g., circle, square), and words describing spatial features and properties (e.g., bent, curvy, edge)? If a sex difference in children's spatial-language use exists, is it related to the spatial language that parents use when interacting with children? We longitudinally tracked the development of spatial-language production in children between the ages of 14 and 46 months in a diverse sample of 58 parent-child dyads interacting in their homes. Boys produced and heard more of these three categories of spatial words, which we call ""what"" spatial types (i.e., unique ""what"" spatial words), but not more of all other word types, than girls. Mediation analysis revealed that sex differences in children's spatial talk at 34 to 46 months of age were fully mediated by parents' earlier spatial-language use, when children were 14 to 26 months old, time points at which there was no sex difference in children's spatial-language use.

Research shows that males are better than females at mentally transforming objects and shapes, and this difference is present in adults (Levine, Foley, Lourenco, Ehrlich, & Ratliff, 2016; Linn & Petersen, 1985; Nazareth, Herrera, & Pruden, 2013; Voyer, Voyer, & Bryden, 1995), children (Frick, Hansen, & Newcombe, 2013; Levine, Huttenlocher, Taylor, & Langrock, 1999; Levine, Vasilyeva, Lourenco, Newcombe, & Huttenlocher, 2005), and even infants (Moore & Johnson, 2008; Quinn & Liben, 2008). Surprisingly, there has been no investigation of whether there is a male advantage in spatiallanguage use or exposure in childhood even though there is evidence that spatial language is related to and supports spatial thinking (Dessalegn & Landau, 2013; Gentner, Özyürek, Gürcanli, & Goldin-Meadow, 2013; Pruden, Levine, & Huttenlocher, 2011; Pyers, Shusterman, Senghas, Spelke, & Emmorey, 2010; Shusterman, Ah Lee, & Spelke, 2011; Verdine, Lucca, Golinkoff, Hirsh-Pasek, & Newcombe, 2016).

In the current investigation, we asked whether there is a sex difference favoring boys in preschoolers' use of spatial language and whether this is attributable to a gender-related difference in parents' spatial-language use. Such a finding would open the possibility that a gender difference in spatial-language use contributes to the well-documented sex differences on tasks such as mental rotation and would open a new route to improving children's spatial-thinking skills and to narrowing sex differences in spatial thinking (Costales, Abad, Odean, & Pruden, 2015; Levine et al., 2016).

Table 1. Distribution of Family Income by Children's Race-Ethnicity

Note: Income information is reported from families' last session.

parents were told to do what they normally do, was transcribed, and researchers coded both parents' and children's spatial-language use. We focused on a particular set of spatial words-words describing the size, shape, and spatial properties of spaces and objects (both animate and inanimate). We focused on these spatial words rather than words describing where an object is located in space (e.g., in, on, far, over, between), because use of location words is highly correlated (i.e., collinear) with overall language use, whereas this is less the case for spatial terms describing what an object looks like (Pruden et al., 2011). Thus, our focus on ""what"" spatial words was driven by the practical difficulty of separating effects involving the use of ""where"" spatial words from overall language use, rather than by the hypothesis that ""what"" spatial words are more important to spatial thinking than ""where"" spatial words (see Landau & Jackendoff, 1993, and Verdine et al., 2016, for more about ""what"" and ""where"" words).

Although parents' spatial-language use may be linked to the differential engagement of boys and girls in spatial activities such as block play, the present study did not focus on contexts of spatial-language use. Rather, our first step was to examine whether there is a sex difference in spatial-language use and exposure. We consider the issue of context in the Discussion section.

The current investigation asked three questions. First, are there sex differences in children's spatial-language use? Second, do parents use more ""what"" spatial language with boys than with girls? And finally, does parents' spatial-language use mediate the relation between children's sex and children's spatial-language use?

### Method

#### Participants

Our sample consisted of 58 typically developing children (30 males, 28 females) and their primary caregivers (52 mothers, 1 father, 5 dual caregivers) from homes in the greater Chicago, Illinois, area. Parent-child dyads

were part of a larger, longitudinal study of children's language development in which 64 families had been recruited for a project examining the relation between parents' input and children's language development. All children were monolingual English speakers. Twenty of the 30 males were firstborn children, and 13 of the 28 females were firstborn children. Six parent-child dyads were not included in the final sample because they had participated in fewer than eight of the nine sessions, which resulted in less opportunity for observation of their spatial-language use.

Families were recruited via an advertisement in a parenting magazine or by a mailing. Interested families completed a screening interview in which they were asked about their demographic information (i.e., family income, primary caregivers' education, primary caregivers' occupation, race-ethnicity, and child's sex). Those families included in our final sample represented the demographics of the greater Chicago area, as measured by family income and race-ethnicity. The distribution of family income according to children's race-ethnicity is shown in Table 1.

Primary caregivers' educational backgrounds varied: 8 reported that they had completed high school but had not taken any college courses, 11 reported that they had taken some college courses or had attended a post-high school trade school, 21 reported earning a bachelor's degree, and 18 reported earning a graduate or professional degree (e.g., master's, doctorate). The average income for our sample fell within the \$50,000 to \$74,999 range. Socioeconomic status (SES) was computed by creating a composite score of the primary caregiver's education level and family income, because a previous principal components analysis on this sample showed that these two variables were weighted equally, and the principal component (i.e., SES composite score) accounted for 72% of the variance in primary caregiver's education level and family income (Rowe & Goldin-Meadow, 2009). SES factor scores were used as a covariate in our mediation analyses to ensure that effects were not explained by SES.

#### Procedure

Parent-child dyads were visited in their homes nine times, once every 4 months starting when children were 14 months old and ending when they were 46 months old. Dyads were videotaped for an average of 90 min during each session. Parents were instructed to do what they ordinarily would do. No toys or specific objects were given to the dyads. A typical session included activities such as playing with toys, reading from books, and eating meals or snacks, but no instructions were given about what activities to engage in. In the event that the parent was engaged in different activities than the child (e.g., the child was playing with toys while the parent was in the kitchen preparing a snack), the research assistant continued to videotape the child.

#### Coding and reliability

Using the established procedures outlined by Huttenlocher, Vasilyeva, Waterfall, Vevea, and Hedges (2007), trained research assistants transcribed the speech of children and their parents at all nine sessions. To ensure reliability, we selected a random 20% of transcripts and asked a second trained research assistant to independently code 10% of children's utterances. Reliability was assessed at the utterance level; the first and second research assistant agreed on 95% of transcript decisions.

For each child and parent, we calculated the cumulative number of ""what"" spatial types (i.e., unique ""what"" spatial words) and tokens (i.e., all ""what"" spatial words) used during all sessions. We also calculated the cumulative use of all other word types and other word tokens. Using the system for analyzing children's language about space (Cannon, Levine, & Huttenlocher, 2007), we coded three categories of ""what"" spatial words and targeted them for further analysis: shape terms, dimension terms, and spatial-features terms. Shape terms are the names of two- and three-dimensional objects and spaces (e.g., circle, triangle, octagon, and the word shape). Dimension terms describe the size of objects, people, and spaces (e.g., big, little, tall, tiny, small, tall, short, and long). Spatial-features terms describe the features and properties of two- and three-dimensional objects, people, and spaces (e.g., bent, curvy, edge, side, line, and corner). Our coding system identified approximately 100 unique dimension, shape, and spatial-features terms. The first author identified and coded targeted ""what"" spatial words; when there were questions about the word's usage, the first author and second author together determined whether its usage was spatial and the category to which it belonged.

Targeted words that were not used in a spatial manner were excluded from our final spatial-word counts. Examples of excluded words are homonyms with meanings that may not have been spatial (e.g., ""Are you my big boy?"" and ""You are a little angel""), metaphorical uses (e.g., ""That took a long time"" and ""You have a big heart""), spatial words used in names (e.g., ""Big Bird"" and ""Little Drummer Boy""), and other spatially ambiguous usages (e.g., ""It will only be a short walk"" might refer to time).

Portions of the current data were previously used to examine the relationship between parents' spatial language and children's spatial cognition and spatial-language use (Pruden et al., 2011). However, this previous study did not explore sex differences in children's spatiallanguage use or differences in parents' spatial-language input to boys versus girls, the focus of the current study.

#### Data analysis

For each child and parent, the number of unique ""what"" spatial types produced (e.g., big and little are two unique types of spatial words) and the number of ""what"" spatial tokens produced (e.g., big used 5 times would be counted as five tokens) were calculated across all sessions to yield cumulative spatial-types and spatial-tokens scores. These cumulative totals included the production of spatial types and spatial tokens across all three ""what"" spatial-language categories coded (i.e., dimensions, shapes, and features). We summed across all ""what"" categories because analysis revealed no interaction between sex and spatial-language category. One child (female) was identified as an outlier (more than 2 SD above the group mean) using the standardized z scores of spatial types. This child's data were not included in any further analyses.1

We also calculated children's and parents' cumulative other word types and tokens across all sessions by tallying all word types and all word tokens each child and parent had produced and subtracting the number of ""what"" spatial types and ""what"" spatial tokens. These variables were used as covariates in the mediation analyses to test whether effects were related to differences in spatial language or to overall language use. However, in cases in which our spatial-language variable was collinear with our overall language variable, as was found with ""what"" spatial types and other word types, we ran a separate analysis with other word types to determine whether our effects were unique to ""what"" spatial types and not a product of overall language use.

Observation sessions averaged 90 min at each session (~810 min total) but varied somewhat across dyads (M = 787.65 min, SD = 33.26, range = 679.33-812.40), as a few dyads completed only 8 sessions instead of 9 sessions. Because of this, we controlled for the amount of time over which children were observed in our analyses.

#### Results

# Are there sex differences in children's spatial-language use?

The first aim of this study was to examine whether there are sex differences in children's use of spatial and other talk. We predicted that boys would produce more ""what"" spatial talk than girls, but there would be no significant difference between the two groups in their amounts of other talk. For all analyses, we used cumulative types and tokens across all sessions and collapsed all three categories of ""what"" spatial words, as no analysis revealed an interaction with category (i.e., dimensional adjectives, shapes, and spatial features) of ""what"" spatial words.

The mean cumulative ""what"" spatial and other word types and tokens across the sessions, as well as standard deviations and ranges, are reported in Table 2. Descriptive statistics for children's language use revealed considerable variability in ""what"" spatial types and spatial tokens, as well as differences by sex. Not surprisingly, some children used relatively few ""what"" spatial types and spatial tokens across the sessions, whereas others used substantially more. Moreover, as reported in a previous publication, the spatial language that children produced predicted their spatial skills on nonverbal tasks (Pruden et al., 2011).

Children's production of ""what"" spatial and other word types. A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) with children's sex as the independent variable and children's word type (""what"" spatial, other) as the dependent variable was significant, F(2, 54) = 3.55, p = . 04, n,2 = . 17. Planned univariate analyses of variance (ANOVAs) revealed that boys produced significantly more ""what"" spatial types than girls, F(1, 55) = 4.91, p = . 03, n,2 = . 08 (Fig. 1b, right), but did not differ from girls in their production of other

word types, F(1, 55) = 0.89, p = . 77, n2 = . 002. This significant sex difference in children's production of ""what"" spatial types held when we controlled for family SES, F(1, 54) = 4.076, p = .048, n,2 = .07; time over which language samples were obtained, F(1, 54) = 3.95, p = . 05, n,2 = . 068; birth order of the child, F(1, 54) = 4.007, p = . 05, ng2 = . 07 (included because some studies have reported effects of birth order on language; e.g., Hoff-Ginsberg, 1998); and parents' gender, F(1, 54) = 4.68, p = . 035, n,2 = . 08. There were still no significant differences between boys' and girls' production of other word types even after we controlled for family SES, F(1, 54) = 0.001, p = . 988, n,2 < . 001; time during which language samples were obtained, F(1, 54) = 0.001, p = . 992, np2 < . 001; birth order of the child, F(1, 54) = 0.002, p = . 965, np2 < . 001; and parents' gender, F(1, 54) = 0.002, p = .965, n,2 < . 001. These results suggest that the difference in spatial-language production does not just reflect greater talkativeness (i.e., use of other word types) of boys than girls, and they show that the sex difference remained even when we controlled for a variety of covariates.

Children's production of ""what"" spatial and other word tokens. A MANOVA with children's sex as the independent variable and children's word tokens (""what"" spatial, other) as the dependent variable was marginally significant, F(2, 54) = 3.016, p = . 06, ng2 = . 10. Planned univariate ANOVAs showed that boys produced marginally more, but not significantly more, ""what"" spatial tokens than girls, F(1, 55) = 3.258, p = .08, n,2 = . 056, but girls and boys did not significantly differ in their production of other word tokens, F(1, 55) = 0.053, p = .82, n,2 = .001. The boy-girl difference in production of ""what"" spatial tokens remained marginally significant when we controlled for family SES, F(1, 54) = 2.50, p = . 12, np2 = . 044; time over which language samples were obtained, F(1, 54) = 2.668, p = . 108, np2 = . 047; birth order of the child, F(1, 54) = 2.438, p = . 124, n,2 = . 043; and parent gender,

F(1, 54) = 2.973, p = .09, np2 = .052. However, there were still no significant differences between boys' and girls' production of other word tokens even after we controlled for family SES, F(1, 54) = 0.301, p = . 585, n 2 = . 006; time during which language samples were obtained, F(1, 54) = 0.262, p = . 611, np2 = . 005; birth order of the child, F(1, 54) = 0.264, p = . 610, np2 = . 005; and parent gender, F(1, 54) = 0.002, p = . 966, η 2 < . 001.

# Are there sex differences in parents' spatial-language use?

The second aim of the study was to examine whether parents used more ""what"" spatial and other word types and tokens with boys than with girls. For these analyses, we used cumulative types and tokens across all sessions, again summing over the three categories of ""what"" spatial words, as the three subcategories of ""what"" spatial words did not show any significant interactions by sex. In Table 3, we report the mean cumulative ""what"" spatial and other word types and tokens that parents of boys and girls produced across all sessions, as well as standard deviations and ranges.

Parents' production of ""what"" spatial and other word types. A MANOVA with children's sex as the independent variable and parents' word types (""what"" spatial, other) as the dependent variable was significant, F(2, 54) = 3.43, p = . 04, no2 = . 11. Planned univariate ANOVAs showed that parents produced significantly more ""what"" spatial types when interacting with boys than with girls, F(1, 55) = 6.83, p = . 01, n,2 = . 11 (Fig. 1b, left). This difference was still significant when we controlled for family SES, F(1, 54) = 6.33, p = . 015, np2 = . 11; time during which language samples were obtained, F(1, 54) = 5.788, p = . 02, n 2 = . 10; birth order of the child, F(1, 54) = 5.789, p = . 02, n 2 = . 10; and parent gender, F(1, 54) = 5.755, p = . 02, ng2 = .10. Parents also produced marginally more other word types when interacting with boys than with girls, F(1, 55) = 3.408, p = . 07, n,2 = . 058. However, this marginally significant difference was reduced to nonsignificance when we controlled for family SES, F(1, 54) = 2.63, p = . 11, n,2 = .046; time during which language samples were obtained, F(1, 54) = 2.56, p = . 12, n22 = . 045; birth order of the child, F(1, 54) = 2.63, p = .11, n22 = .046; and parent gender, F(1, 54) = 1.84, p = . 18, n,2 = . 033.

Parents' production of ""what"" spatial and other word tokens. A MANOVA with children's sex as the independent variable and parents' word tokens (""what"" spatial, other) as the dependent variable was significant, F(2, 54) = 6.05, p = . 004, np2 = . 18. Planned univariate ANOVAs revealed that parents produced significantly more ""what"" spatial tokens with boys than with girls, F(1, 55) = 10.79, p = . 002, ng2 = . 16. The significant sex difference in parents' production of ""what"" spatial tokens held when we controlled for family SES, F(1, 54) = 10.183, p = .002, ng2 = . 159; time during which language samples were obtained, F(1, 54) = 9.508, p = . 003, np2 = . 15; birth order of the child, F(1, 54) = 9.457, p = . 003, np = .149; and parent gender, F(1, 54) = 9.65, p = . 003, np2 = .152. Parents also used significantly more other word tokens when interacting with boys than with girls, F(1, 55) = 11.28, p = . 001, ng = . 17. This significant difference held when we controlled for family SES, F(1, 54) = 11.003, p = . 002, ng2 = . 169; time during which language samples were obtained, F(1, 54) = 10.036, p = . 003, n 2 = . 157; birth order of the child, F(1, 54) = 9.538, p = .003, np2 = . 150; and parent gender, F(1, 54) = 8.663, p = . 005, n 2 = . 138. Given that the sex difference in parents' production of language was not unique to ""what"" spatial tokens, but also included other word tokens, we focused all further analyses on parents' ""what"" spatial types.

Table 4. Effects of Including Covariates in the Model of Children's Sex as a Predictor of Children's ""What"" Spatial Types, as Mediated by Parents' ""What"" Spatial Types

Note: See Figure 1 for an illustration of the basic mediation model. SES = socioeconomic status.

# Does parents' input mediate the sex difference in children's spatial talk?

The third and final aim of the study was to evaluate whether parents' ""what"" spatial types mediated the relation between children's sex and children's ""what"" spatial types (note that we could not carry out this analysis on ""what"" spatial tokens because a significant difference in the number of ""what"" spatial tokens that boys and girls produced was a necessary finding for carrying out a mediation analysis; Baron & Kenny, 1986).

To meet the prerequisites of a mediation analysis, we first ran regressions to confirm that there was (a) a significant relation between the predictor variable (children's sex) and outcome variable (children's ""what"" spatial types), (b) a significant relation between the predictor variable and mediating variable (parents' ""what"" spatial types), and (c) a significant relation between the mediating variable and the outcome variable (children's ""what"" spatial types). Once these significant relations were established, we conducted a linear regression with parents' ""what"" spatial types as a potential mediator between children's sex and children's ""what"" spatial types. For these analyses, we used the cumulative number of ""what"" spatial types across all sessions. Regression analysis showed that children's sex significantly predicted children's ""what"" spatial types, ß = 0.55, t(55) = 2.22, p = .03, and children's sex significantly predicted parents' ""what"" spatial types, ß = 0.64, t(55) = 2.61, p = . 01 (Fig. 1c). Finally, parents' ""what"" spatial types predicted children's ""what"" spatial types, ß = 0.70, t(55) = 7.19, p < .001 (Fig. 1c). Thus, the prerequisite relations between all three variables of interest were met for a mediation analysis to be conducted. Figure 1a shows a scatterplot of children's number of ""what"" spatial types in relation to parents' number of ""what"" spatial types.

When parents' ""what"" spatial types were included as a potential mediator, the path coefficient (path c') was significantly reduced and no longer significant, ß = 0.10, t(55) = 0.51, p = . 61 (Fig. 1c). This suggests that parents' ""what"" spatial types fully mediated the sex difference in children's production of ""what"" spatial types. A biascorrected bootstrapping procedure (1,000 iterations; Preacher & Hayes, 2004) provided a 95% confidence interval of -0.81 to -0.08. This interval did not contain zero, which suggests that the reduction in the direct relation between children's sex and children's ""what"" spatial types was significant. These results suggest that the relation between children's sex and children's ""what"" spatial types was fully mediated by parents' ""what"" spatial types, which accounted for the sex difference in children's ""what"" spatial types. This model accounted for over 51% of the variance (adjusted R2) in children's production of ""what"" spatial types.

Our effects held, with the path coefficients retaining the same significance, after we controlled for children's other word types, family SES, length of language transcripts, birth order of the child, and parents' gender in follow-up mediation analyses (see Table 4 for covariates and adjusted R2s for each model). A potential criticism is that parents' production of other word types could explain the mediation. However, not surprisingly, parents' other word types were highly correlated with parents' ""what"" spatial types (r = . 81, p < . 001, two-tailed). This multicollinearity precludes including both in the same mediation model (Iacobucci, 2008). We did, however, run the same mediation model with parents' other word types as the mediator instead of parents' ""what"" spatial types. Our expectation was that if parents' language in general was responsible for the sex difference in children's ""what"" spatial types, then parents' other word types would mediate the relation in the same way as parents' ""what"" spatial types had.
We found that the relation between children's sex and parents' other word types was not significant, ß = 0.48, t(55) = 1.85, p = .07; however, the relation between parents' other word types and children's ""what"" spatial types was significant, ß = 0.50, t(55) = 4.49, p < . 001, and, as reported previously, the relation between children's sex and children's ""what"" spatial types was also significant, ß = 0.55, t(55) = 2.22, p = . 03. While there was statistically no path for mediation given the lack of a significant path from the independent variable to the mediator, when parents' other word types were included as a potential mediator, the path coefficient was significantly reduced and no longer significant, ß = 0.31, t(55) = 1.41, p = . 16. This suggests that parents' other word types may also be a potential mediator of the reported sex difference in children's production of ""what"" spatial types. A bias-corrected bootstrapping procedure (1,000 iterations) provided a 95% confidence interval of 0.0034 to 0.5164. This interval did not contain zero, which suggests that the reduction in the direct relation between children's sex and children's ""what"" spatial types was significant. This model accounted for 31% of the variance (adjusted R2) in children's production of ""what"" spatial types. These findings leave open the question of whether parents' use of spatial language was a specific predictor of children's spatial language or whether these findings might simply be explained by parents' overall language use with their children. We will return to this issue when we discuss using lagged data to examine whether parents' other word types mediated sex differences in children's ""what"" spatial types.

We next tested whether children's spatial-language input could explain this effect by testing the reverse causal mediation model in which children's ""what"" spatial types served as the mediator between children's sex and parents' ""what"" spatial types. When children's ""what"" spatial types were included as a potential mediator, the path coefficient was significantly reduced and no longer significant, ß = 0.26, t(55) = 1.41, p = . 1635. This suggests that children's ""what"" spatial types fully mediated the sex difference in parents' production of ""what"" spatial types. This model accounted for 52.87% of the variance (adjusted R2) in parents' production of ""what"" spatial types. This finding suggests that there may be effects of children's production of spatial types on parents' production of spatial types and leaves open the possibility that sex differences in spatial-language production may be driven not by parents but by children, or may be bidirectional. To further explore the directionality of the sex difference, we used a lagged analysis of our longitudinal data with parents and children.

# Lagged analysis of longitudinal data

To further probe whether parents' spatial-language input could explain the sex difference in children's spatial-language production, we ran an additional mediation model utilizing parents' ""what"" spatial types produced during the first four sessions (14-26 months) and children's ""what"" spatial types produced during the last four sessions (34-46 months). This model was less likely to suffer from reverse causal effects (child to parent) and thus allowed us to explore stronger evidence that parents' spatial-language input could explain the sex difference in children's spatial-language production (and not children's production explaining parents' production). In addition, we continued to explore whether parents' other word types might be an alternative plausible mediator of the sex difference in children's ""what"" spatial types.

We replicated our previous findings utilizing data from four different sessions for children and parents. On average, parents produced 11.57 ""what"" spatial types (SD = 4.60, range = 3-21) with boys and 8.07 ""what"" spatial types (SD = 4.36, range = 0-18) with girls during the early sessions. A MANOVA with children's sex as the independent variable and parents' word types (""what"" spatial, other) during the early sessions as the dependent variable was significant, F(2, 54) = 4.47, p = . 02, ng2 = . 14. Planned univariate ANOVAs showed that during the early sessions, parents produced significantly more ""what"" spatial types when interacting with boys than when interacting with girls, F(1, 55) = 8.61, p = . 005, n,2 = . 14 (Fig. 2b, left). Moreover, parents did not significantly differ in their production of other word types with boys versus girls during the early sessions, F(1, 55) = 2.44, p = . 124, n,2 = . 04, which suggests again that parents did not generally provide more diverse vocabulary with boys than girls during the first 2 years of life. Looking at children's production of ""what"" spatial types during the later sessions, we found that, on average, boys produced 10.23 ""what"" spatial types (SD = 5.16, range = 2-21), and girls produced 7.74 ""what"" spatial types (SD = 3.98, range = 1-17). A MANOVA with children's sex as the independent variable and children's word types (""what"" spatial, other) during the later sessions as the dependent variable did not reach significance, F(2, 54) = 2.09, p = . 13, np2 = . 07.

Planned univariate ANOVAs showed that boys indeed produced more ""what"" spatial types than girls at the later sessions, F(1, 55) = 4.11, p = . 048, np2 = . 07 (Fig. 2b, right), but boys and girls did not significantly differ in their production of other word types, F(1, 55) = 0.24, p = . 63, η 2 = . 004. These results suggest that even when looking at how parents' ""what"" spatial types at earlier sessions predicted children's ""what"" spatial types at later sessions, we found that boys produced significantly more ""what"" spatial types-but not more other word types-than girls.

We also asked whether boys and girls differed in their production of ""what"" spatial and other word types during the earliest four sessions. On average, boys

produced 2.30 ""what"" spatial types (SD = 2.18, range = 0-8) and girls produced 1.70 ""what"" spatial types (SD = 1.98, range = 0-7) during the early sessions. On average, boys produced 215.20 other word types (SD = 133.91, range = 6-493), and girls produced 232.07 other word types (SD = 122.20, range = 41-558). A MANOVA with children's sex as the independent variable and children's word types (""what"" spatial, other) as the dependent variable was not significant, F(2, 54) = 2.43, p = . 10, np2 = . 08. Planned univariate ANOVAs revealed no significant sex difference in either children's ""what"" spatial types, F(1, 55) = 1.16, p = .29, ηρ2 = .02, or children's other word types, F(1, 55) = 0.25, p = . 62, n,2 = .004, at these early sessions, which suggests that children's own initial sex difference in spatial-language use is not a plausible explanation for either their later sex difference in spatial-word types or for parents' greater use of spatial types with boys than with girls at the early or later sessions. This lack of an early sex difference in children's ""what"" spatial types also precluded carrying out any further lagged analysis (i.e., early child differences predicting later parent differences).

We next explored whether parents' greater use of ""what"" spatial types with boys than with girls at the early sessions provides a plausible explanation for boys' greater use of ""what"" spatial types at the later sessions. Figure 2a shows a scatterplot of children's number of ""what"" spatial types at the later sessions in relation to parents' number of ""what"" spatial types at the early sessions. Regression analysis showed that children's sex significantly predicted children's ""what"" spatial types produced at the four later sessions, ß = 0.52, t(55) = 2.03, p = . 0476, and children's sex significantly predicted parents' ""what"" spatial types using only parents' ""what"" spatial types produced at the four early sessions, ß = 0.73, t(55) = 2.93, p = . 0049 (Fig. 2c). Finally, parents' ""what"" spatial types at the early sessions predicted children's ""what"" spatial types at the later sessions, ß = 0.39, t(55) = 3.02, p = . 0039 (Fig. 2c). When parents' ""what"" spatial types produced at the early sessions were included as a mediator, the path coefficient was significantly reduced and no longer significant, ß = 0.23, t(55) = 0.9084, p = . 37 (Fig. 2c), which suggests that parents' ""what"" spatial types fully mediated the sex difference in children's ""what"" spatial types. The bias-corrected bootstrapping procedure yielded a 95% confidence interval that did not contain zero ([-0.84, -0.03]), which suggests that the reduction in the direct relation between children's sex and children's ""what"" spatial types was significant. This model accounted for 17% of the variance in children's ""what"" spatial types.

As with our analysis including all sessions, we wanted to ensure that our finding here was not simply that parents' other word types at the early sessions was explaining the sex differences in children's ""what"" spatial types at the later sessions. As with our previous analysis, we found, not surprisingly, that at the early sessions, parents' other word types were highly correlated with parents' ""what"" spatial types (r = . 72, p < .001, two-tailed), which again reveals that multicollinearity is an issue when using both variables in the same model. Thus, we again ran a separate mediation model with parents' other word types-instead of parents' ""what"" spatial types-during the first four sessions as the mediator.

Contrary to the model that included data from all sessions, this model did not reveal evidence that parents' other word types at the first four sessions mediated the relation between children's sex and children's ""what"" spatial types at the last four sessions. As in the mediation model that included all sessions, there was no significant relation between children's sex and parents' other word types, ß = 0.41, t(55) = 1.56, p = . 12. Similar to the model including all sessions, there was a significant relation between parents' other word types and children's ""what"" spatial types, ß = 0.39, t(55) = 3.17, p = . 003, and the relation between children's sex and children's ""what"" spatial types was also significant, ß = 0.52, t(55) = 2.06, p = . 048. While there was statistically no path for mediation given the lack of a significant path between children's sex and parents' other word types, when parents' other word types were included as a potential mediator, the path coefficient was significantly reduced and no longer significant, ß = 0.36, t(55) = 1.49, p = . 14.

However, unlike in our analysis including all sessions, the bias-corrected bootstrapping procedure (1,000 iterations) provided a 95% confidence interval of -0.0089 to 0.4030, which did contain zero. This suggests that the reduction in the direct relation between children's sex and children's ""what"" spatial types was not significant. This model accounted for less than 19% of the variance (adjusted R2) in children's production of ""what"" spatial types. This mediation model, in conjunction with the model that tested parents' spatial types as a possible mediator, points to the unique role that parents' ""what"" spatial types play in explaining the sex differences in children's ""what"" spatial types. These findings with only the first four sessions for parents' ""what"" spatial types and the last four sessions for children's ""what"" spatial types suggest that parents' spatial-language input may explain the sex difference in children's spatial-language production (and not children's production of ""what"" spatial types explaining parents' production of these word types or parents' production of other word types explaining children's difference in spatial types).

# Discussion

This study addressed two questions. First, is there a sex difference in children's spatial-language production, with boys producing more ""what"" spatial talk than girls, and second, do parents of boys and girls differ in their spatial-language use with their children, which would potentially explain this sex difference? With regard to our first question, we found a sex difference in the production of ""what"" spatial language during preschool years, which was significant during naturalistic interactions occurring when children were between 34 and 46 months old, but not earlier. Compared with girls, boys produced more unique ""what"" spatial words (i.e., dimensional adjectives, shape words, and spatialfeatures words). This sex difference in spatial-language production is a potential contributor to documented sex differences in spatial skills, including mental rotation, as research finds that spatial-language use is related to children's performance on nonverbal spatial tasks (Gentner et al., 2013; Pruden et al., 2011).

Our second question, whether parents' spatiallanguage use contributes to the sex difference in children's spatial-language use, was motivated by research finding that the most important factors predicting children's later language growth are frequency and type of language experiences (i.e., the amount and type of language children hear; Hart & Risley, 1995; Huttenlocher, Haight, Bryk, Seltzer, & Lyons, 1991). Variance estimates suggest that early language input accounts for between 12 and 64% of unique variance in children's later language skills (Walker, Greenwood, Hart, & Carta, 1994). Research has shown that parents' use of specific words predicts children's use of those words. Parents' use of number words with 14- to 30-month-olds predicts children's number talk and their later understanding of the cardinal meaning of number words (Gunderson & Levine, 2011).

Utilizing a longitudinal design, we examined whether parents' use of ""what"" spatial language mediates the sex difference found in children's use of ""what"" spatial words. Mediation analyses confirmed that parents' production of ""what"" spatial types fully mediated the sex difference in children's production of unique ""what"" spatial words, even when we controlled for a variety of variables. This mediation produced similar results when parents' and children's sessions were contemporaneous (all sessions when children were between the ages of 14 and 46 months) and when they were distinct (parents' ""what"" spatial types produced when children were between 14 and 26 months old and children's ""what"" spatial types when they were between 34 and 46 months old). Results suggest that parents' spatial-language input is an important predictor of children's spatial productive vocabularies. Multicollinearity of spatial-language input with other language input precluded our entering both types of parents' language input into the same analysis. However, in our lagged analyses, we found that parents' ""what"" spatial types mediated the relation between children's sex and children's ""what"" spatial types, whereas parents' other word types did not. Specifically, the lagged analysis with parents' other word types as the mediator did not meet the statistical prerequisites for mediation. Despite this, we conducted the mediation and found that this variable did not function as a mediator in the same way as parents' ""what"" spatial types did in our lagged analysis.

One finding was surprising given that previous literature examining spatial-language development (e.g., Pruden et al., 2011) has shown that the quantity of spatial tokens used by parents significantly predicted the quantity of spatial tokens used by children and those children's later spatial skills. Although we found that results for spatial tokens were in the same direction as results for spatial types, we did not find a significant sex difference in children's production of spatial tokens (the sheer number of spatial words produced). Rather, we found that the sex differences for parents and children were significant for the variety of spatial words produced. The lack of effects for spatial tokens may be a product of our small sample size, and our effect sizes for spatial tokens suggest that this may be the case.

Although the sex difference in the number of unique ""what"" spatial words that children hear and produce is small, it is potentially meaningful. In a prior study using the same database, we found that children's own use of spatial language in the first 4 years of life predicted their spatial skills at 4.5 years old (Pruden et al., 2011). Those children who talked more about the spatial world had better spatial skills-skills linked to achievement in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. For example, mental rotation is linked to success in STEM college courses (Wai, Lubinski, Benbow, & Steiger, 2010) as well as to improvement on a number-line task and the ability to solve missing-term problems in elementary school children (Cheng & Mix, 2014; Gunderson, Ramirez, Beilock, & Levine, 2012). Thus, our findings have potential practical implications for efforts to enhance spatial thinking, which has been shown to be a significant predictor of STEM success (Wai et al., 2010).

What contributes to the sex difference that we uncovered in parents' and children's use of ""what"" spatial language? First, it is possible that children's spatiallanguage use drives parents' spatial-language use, rather than the reverse. This seems unlikely given that parents provided more ""what"" spatial language to boys than to girls at early sessions when there was not a significant sex difference in children's use of ""what"" spatial language. Further, this early difference in parents' usage predicted the later sex difference in children's spatial-language use, whereas the reverse was not true-that is, we did not find that an early sex difference in children's use of ""what"" spatial language predicted a later sex difference in parents' use of ""what"" spatial language. However, our correlational findings cannot rule out the possibility of reverse causation or that there is a bidirectional relation between parents' and children's use of ""what"" spatial language.

Second, it is possible that parents use more ""what"" spatial language with boys because boys engage more in spatial activities (Cherney & Voyer, 2010; Kersh, Casey, & Young, 2008) or find construction activities more attractive (Caldera, Huston, & O'Brien, 1985; Campenni, 1999). There is evidence that spatial language occurs more commonly in the context of spatial activities than in the context of nonspatial activities and evidence that boys play more with certain spatial toys than girls do, including blocks (Caldera et al., 1985; Ferrarra, Hirsh-Pasek, Newcombe, Golinkoff, & Lam, 2011; Kersh et al., 2008; Saracho, 1994) and Legos (Caldera et al., 1985; Campenni, 1999).

Third, it is possible that parents hold stereotypes about boys being better at spatial thinking than girls, and as a consequence, may provide boys with more opportunities for spatial play, which could increase boys' exposure to spatial language. Relatedly, it is possible that parents support the spatial play of girls and boys differently. Parents may work harder to support the success of boys than girls in spatial activities, perhaps by providing more spatial language to them. There is evidence that this may be the case in contexts of parent-child puzzle play (Levine, Ratliff, Huttenlocher, & Cannon, 2012) and block play (Petersen & Levine, 2015).

These open questions can be addressed by experimentally manipulating adults' spatial-language use with children and examining how this affects children's spatial-language production and thinking. It is also important to compare spatial language provided to boys and girls by mothers and fathers in a study that includes more fathers interacting with their children (the present study included fathers in only six of the parent-child dyads). Future work will also need to determine whether the findings we report for ""what"" spatial words generalize to all types of spatial words. Here, we selectively examined spatial words that encode spatial features of objects (shape terms, dimensional adjectives, spatial-features terms) because our prior findings showed that spatial language used to describe where objects were located in space was highly correlated with overall language use, whereas this was less the case for language used to describe spatial features of the objects themselves (Pruden et al., 2011).

Another important question concerns the contexts most conducive to exposing children to rich spatial language. It is important to determine whether differential engagement in spatial activities (block and puzzle play) accounts for parents' differential use of spatial language with boys than with girls (Dearing et al., 2012; Jirout & Newcombe, 2015; Levine et al., 2012; Verdine et al., 2014). If this were the case, it would suggest that increasing children's, particularly girls', engagement in spatial activities would increase not only their opportunities to engage in spatial thinking but also their exposure to spatial language. As it currently stands, boys are more likely to play with blocks than girls are (Kersh et al., 2008; Petersen & Levine, 2015). However, if block play and the spatial language that accompanies block play are important to building spatial skills, all children should be encouraged to engage in this kind of play. Studies suggest that spatial play and language go hand in hand (Ferrarra et al., 2011), and both contribute to the development of spatial thinking (Fisher, Hirsh-Pasek, Newcombe, & Golinkoff, 2013; Levine et al., 2012; Petersen & Levine, 2015). Thus, it is possible that by encouraging spatial play, parents will support spatial thinking, not only by how they play but also by the spatial language they use when doing so. In view of the documented importance of spatial thinking for STEM achievement, this approach holds promise for increasing STEM diversity.

Research shows that after layoffs, employees often report decreased commitment and performance which has been coined the survivor syndrome. However, the mechanisms underlying this effect remain underexplored. The purpose of the paper is to show that reduced organizational identification can serve as an explanation for the survivor syndrome. We conducted a laboratory experiment, in which participants work as a group of employees for another participant who acts as employer. In the course of the experiment, the employer decides whether one of his or her employees should be laid off or not. Mediation analysis supports a social identity-based explanation for the emergence of the survivor syndrome: downsizing causes lower identification with the employer which in turn relates to lower performance of employees.

# INTRODUCTION

Downsizing is a conventional management practice in modern economies. Between 2003 and 2011 the number of laid off US employees amounts to the size of Dallas, Texas (i.e., over 1.2 million) - every year (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2012). Despite its wide spread usage, there is little evidence for the effectiveness of downsizing: studies find both negative and positive relationships between downsizing and firm performance or stock market reactions, respectively. However, negative effects are more likely to be the rule than the exception (e.g., Cascio et al., 1997; Nixon et al., 2004; Guthrie and Datta, 2008; for an overview see Datta et al., 2010). There are several explanations for these negative effects such as increased stress due to higher workload of the remaining employees. The effect may also be due to a lower commitment of the remaining employees – the so called survivor syndrome. In this paper, we will test this latter explanation. More specifically, we will test the causal effects of downsizing on employee identification and its effect on performance in turn using a controlled experimental design to rule out alternative explanations.

Evidence for the existence of the survivor syndrome comes from a number of field studies. This literature shows that, compared to pre-downsizing, survivors report lower job involvement (Brockner et al., 1988), commitment (Armstrong-Stassen, 1998; Allen et al., 2001), creativity (Amabile and Conti, 1999), performance (Armstrong-Stassen, 1998; Brockner et al., 2004; Travaglione and Cross, 2006), and higher feelings of insecurity and strain (De Cuyper et al., 2010). Also, absenteeism was found to be higher after downsizing (Travaglione and Cross, 2006).

Although this evidence is correlative, the number of studies suggest that the survivor syndrome is a robust phenomenon.

After downsizing, remaining employees could, for instance, suffer from increased stress, guild or mistrust in the management (see Petzall et al., 2000). Given the correlative data structure, it is hard to disentangle underlying mechanisms in the field. For this reason, we seek to complement the available evidence from field studies by providing evidence from an experiment in which we studied the effects of downsizing on identification in a controlled environment. The experiment we will be presenting in this paper is based on the idea that downsizing translates into lower identification with the employer which, in turn, will explain detrimental behavior patterns of surviving employees.

To the best of our knowledge, we are the first who provide evidence that lower organizational identification might explain the behavior of surviving employees. In contrast to previous experiments, we assigned participants to the role of employers who could voluntarily decide whether to lay off an employee or not. As employers are responsible for downsizing in our experiment, we are confident to create somewhat realistic reactions of employees in response to their employer's decisions – albeit in a laboratory setting.

Although there are a number of studies on mergers and organizational change processes, downsizing received almost no attention in the social identity literature. However, there are downsizing studies which focus on the related concept of organizational commitment (for an overview, see van Dierendonck and Jacobs, 2012). Lee and Corbett (2006), for instance, compared employees of two Korean banks after downsizing. Employees of bank A were survivors of a relatively mild downsizing (from 13 to 10 thousand employees) whereas employees of bank B were survivors of a severe program involving a reduction from 8 to about 4 thousand employees and an additional pay cut. In line with the hypotheses, the authors found that employees of bank B reported much lower affective organizational commitment and that parts of the effect were directly related to the downsizing but that the major share of the effect was due to indirect effects of the downsizing on daily work practices and experiences such as promotional chances, openness to new ideas or job complexity. To the best of our knowledge, there is no study that integrates effects of downsizing on identification and effects of identification on organizational or individual outcomes into one empirical model. Taken together, with our experimental mediation analysis, we address crucial research gaps in both, the social identity and the downsizing literature. This is important for two reasons: Establishing the causal link between downsizing and employee identification in an experimental study is theoretically important as confirmation of the theory and goes above and beyond establishing a simple relationship. Practically, it also is important to demonstrate that downsizing may negatively affect employee identification as it helps managers and change agents realizing that it is identity-related concerns of their employees that may render negative effects for their future productivity – and not (only) concerns about financial or other implications of the downsizing process.

## Theoretical Background

The basic idea of the Social Identity Theory is that people do not only think and act as individuals, but also as members of social groups. According to Tajfel and Turner (1979), social identification, i.e., the internalization of group memberships, serves the purpose of enhancing the individual's self-esteem. The self-enhancement is evident in case of high status groups, or in the terms of Social Identity Theory, when the social identity is positive. However, other motives such as the need for predictability (Hogg and Terry, 2000) also encourage individuals to categorize themselves as members of a particular group.

Identification processes are highly relevant for organizational life. Ashforth and Mael (1989) were among the first who have introduced the concept to the organizational psychology and management field and have argued that organizational identification - in contrast to organizational commitment strengthens the self-referential aspect of identity which helps the employees answer the question of who they are in terms of their social identity, i.e., the self concept derived from their membership in the organization. Mael and Ashforth (1992) have studied organizational identification empirically and have developed a scale to measure the construct. They found that college alumni who perceived their college more different from similar colleges and perceived it having high prestige were more likely to identify with it which in turn related to a greater willingness to recommend it and to donate money to its activities. Akerlof and Kranton (2000, p. 717) state that "". . . because identification is fundamental to behavior, choice of identity may be the most important 'economic' decision people make."" Indeed, meta-analytic results reveal positive relationships between organizational identification and, for example, job involvement, in-role performance, extra-role performance, and organizational prestige, as well as negative relationships to turnover intentions (Riketta, 2005). Identification can refer to different foci, such as the organization, work group or ones career (Christ et al., 2003). Interestingly, there is a huge social identity literature in the context of mergers and change processes (for an overview, see Drzensky and van Dick, 2013). However, identification received almost no research attention in the context of downsizing. In one of the few exceptions, Armstrong-Stassen et al. (1996) find that nurses report lower identification with their hospital after downsizing. Brockner et al. (1987) focus on survivors' identification with the victim. They find negative effects on employee performance when identification with the victim is high and the victim's treatment is seen as unfair. Johnson et al. (1996) study two waves of downsizing in an insurance company and find positive relationships between organizational identification and work satisfaction.

Organizational identification is related to affective organizational commitment (see Allen and Meyer, 1990). While both concepts focus on the attachment of individuals to an organization, theoretically, only identification relies on selfcategorization processes and, empirically, confirmatory factor analyses show the distinctiveness of both concepts (Gautam et al., 2004). Although the two constructs typically correlate to 0.65 or higher (see the meta-analysis by Riketta, 2005), we still

see the remaining unshared variation in light of the theoretical distinctiveness as important. Therefore, we believe that a study on how downsizing affects (surviving) employees' identification as needed despite some evidence from (questionnaire) studies on the downsizing-commitment link. Organizational identification is, amongst other things, influenced by the relationship with the immediate supervisor: Sluss et al. (2008) found that a high quality (LMX) relationship between supervisor and employee leads to more organizational identification and that this link is mediated by employees' perception of more organizational support (POS). There are a number of studies which find that survivors report lower commitment after downsizing (e.g., Armstrong-Stassen, 1998; Allen et al., 2001; Travaglione and Cross, 2006). It was also found that, following downsizing, changes in commitment predict employee turnover (Spreitzer and Mishra, 2002). However, most studies do not focus on downsizing versus non-downsizing, but study, for instance, how fairness or justice of the downsizing process predicts changes in commitment (see van Dierendonck and Jacobs, 2012). To the best of our knowledge, there is no study which accounts for both, i.e., the effects of downsizing on identification and consequences of changes in commitment on organizational behavior.

#### Hypotheses

A number of field studies find negative associations of downsizing and (mostly self-reported) performance (Armstrong-Stassen, 1998; Brockner et al., 2004; Travaglione and Cross, 2006). However, these field studies find only weak support by previous experiments. Brockner et al. (1985, 1986, 1987, 1993) implemented an experimental design, in which two persons (the participant and a confederate) had to perform a proofreading task. In the downsizing treatment, the confederate was laid off because of ""room scheduling problems."" Only in the case of low victim's compensation and high identification with the victim, Brockner et al. (1987) find negative effects of downsizing on the remaining employees' performance. However, in the remaining studies (Brockner et al., 1985, 1986, 1993), survivors even increased their performance after a layoff. Note that in these experiments downsizing was implemented due to outside conditions (room scheduling). In our experiment, one participant in the role of an ""employer"" has to decide whether or not to lay off one of the other participants acting as ""employees"". As we assume this treatment to be closer to organizational decisions, we expect to replicate evidence from the field.

From a social identity perspective, high identification is associated with embracing and following group norms. In work contexts, this typically involves high performance. Strongly identified employees should, theoretically, also support any change in the organization - such as a downsizing program more than less identified employees. This, however, is only true as long as the change is perceived to be in the organization's best interest. In most change contexts, however, employees might not perceive that the change helps the organization becoming a better group, which would feed back into the individual employees' self-concept. Rather, change is often followed by resistance - particularly by the highly identified who perceive the change as a threat to the organization's core identity and thus as a threat to their own identities as organizational members (van Dijk and van Dick, 2009). Although the two constructs typically correlate to.65 or higher (see the meta-analysis by Riketta, 2005), we still see the remaining unshared variation in light of the theoretical distinctiveness as important. Therefore, we believe that a study on how downsizing affects (surviving) employees' identification as needed despite some evidence from (questionnaire) studies on the downsizing-commitment link. This has been demonstrated by research on mergers and acquisitions over and over again (see for an overview: Giessner et al., 2011) and also for organizational change initiatives in general (Drzensky and van Dick, 2013). We therefore propose that downsizing will negatively relate to employee performance because the downsizing will be perceived as a threat to the organization's identity. This will lead to lower organizational identification and in turn a lower motivation to follow the organization's norms and help accomplish its goals.

H1: Downsizing leads to lower performance of the surviving employees (survivor effect).

Employers who opt for layofts might create the impression not to take care of their employees' best interests. Working for an employer who opted for downsizing may thus lead to a negative social identity. Consequently, in the case of downsizing, employees should reduce their identification with the employer. This effect would experimentally replicate results from field studies (Armstrong-Stassen, 1998; Allen et al., 2001; Travaglione and Cross, 2006).

H2: Downsizing negatively relates to employees' identification with the employer.

Given the positive relationship between identification and performance (Riketta, 2005; Riketta and van Dick, 2005), we hypothesize that reduced identification with the employer will explain the survivor effect.

H3: The survivor effect (i.e., lower employee performance post downsizing) is mediated by identification with the employer. More specifically, downsizing is negatively related to survivors' identification with the employer, which in turn is positively related to survivors' performance.

## MATERIALS AND METHODS

## Participants and Design

Overall, 80 individuals participated in three laboratory experimental sessions - 20 in the role of employers and 60 as employees. Fifty-two percent of the participants were male, average age was 24.54 years (SD = 6.35). Participants were students of 18 different majors (including 14% economics students). An ethics approval was not deemed necessary for the study. The study design and all steps followed the standard economic procedure. All participants were fully aware of all the details of the study at any time. They were not deceived, were paid in real money and they knew that they could quit

their participation at any time. Participation was completely anonymous - no personal information such as names were obtained at any stage of the experiment. Participants were not put under any stress at any time. We invited participants from the department of economics laboratory subject pool which comprises about 3500 students of all different majors of the Goethe-University Frankfurt using the ORSEE software (Greiner, 2004) which randomly selects and invites participants from the pool. Participants could earn real money (roughly 10–15) depending on their performance in the tasks but received no other compensation (such as course credits).

The basic design of our experiment is as follows (see also Drzensky and Heinz, 2015): For two 10 min periods, employees work on a real-effort task. Between the periods, the employer decides either to downsize or not.

By drawing a lot, we randomly divided the sample into employees and employers, respectively. Three employees were assigned to one employer. All employees were located at an individual computer workplace in the laboratory. Employers were seated in a separate room. The setting was completely anonymous and communication within or between groups was not possible. After the allocation, we distributed the instructions (first period instructions included no reference to downsizing). Participants' task was to arrange sliders on a computer screen (see details below). We explained that the experiment would consist of two parts, but that behavior in the first part had no consequences for the second part. Employees were compensated by a fixed wage of 8€ for each period they worked for ""their"" employer. By earning 0.03€ for every correctly arranged slider, employers' compensation depended on the performance of ""their"" employees. After period one, participants received instructions for the second period. At this point, every employer had to decide whether to lay off one employee or not. If he or she decided against downsizing, period two was identical to period one. In the case of downsizing, he or she received a fixed compensation of 5€ as an incentive to downsize plus 0.03€ for each slider correctly processed by the two surviving employees. The amount of the fixed compensation was calibrated by running a pretest in which we found that 5€ incite a sufficient number of employers to decide for downsizing.

Surviving employees earned 8€ again, while employees who had been laid off (referred to as victims in the following) received no further payment, but remained in the room until the end of the experiment. They could arrange sliders, but their effort had no consequences for themselves or the employer. To summarize, employers decided if they wanted to lay off one employee. Nevertheless, as the particular victim was determined by throwing dice, they could not choose who was laid off.

Employees were aware of their employer's trade-off and knew that we did not reveal their first period performance. Employers, on the other hand, knew that employees were aware of their trade-off. To give employers a sense of how many sliders employees might arrange in a 10 min interval, we conducted a pretest 3 weeks before the main experiment. However, the data was provided to employers only.

# Measures

### Performance

The slider task (see Gill and Prowse, 2012) is a computer based real-effort task. Each slider is a small button, which participants can move on a bar by using the computer mouse (arrow keys were masked). Initially, sliders are situated at the left side of the bar. A slider is successfully arranged when the button is exactly at the middle of the bar. Every second minute, a new screen with 48 sliders in three columns was presented. Thus, ceiling effects were not possible. During both working periods, employees could alternatively surf in the internet. The performance measure is the sum of correctly arranged sliders by a particular employee, separately for period one and two. In the regression analyses, we controlled for period one performance. For testing our hypotheses, we regressed performance in period two on performance in period one and estimated effects by using the residuals (which are, by definition, uncorrelated with period one performance).

#### Identification

Identification was measured with a four-item scale (Doosje et al., 1995) with the endpoints ""don't agree at all"" to ""completely agree."" After both periods, we asked employees about their identification with the employer (e.g. ""the employer and I belong to the same group""; a = 0.70 - 0.71) and with the group of employees (e.g. ""I feel a strong attachment to members of the group of employees""; a = 0.65 - 0.77).

#### Downsizing

Employers made their decision for or against downsizing by filling in a form. Thus, downsizing is a binary variable, coded 1 if downsizing was executed and coded 0 in the case of no downsizing.

# RESULTS

Table 1 shows the means and standard deviations separately for survivors and employees in the non-downsizing group as well as reliability coefficients and intercorrelations for both groups. As victims were excluded in period two measures (by definition, as they were laid off), for the purpose of comparability, we omitted also their period one data.

Since all employees were treated equally up to the beginning of period two, we should observe no difference between the groups (i.e., between survivors and those who are in a non-downsizing group) in period one. Indeed, we find no significant differences between the groups, neither for period one identification with the employer [Mnon-downsizing = 2.59, SD = 1.32; Msurvivors = 2.88, SD = 1.09; t(46) = - 0.80; p = 0.43], nor for period one identification with the group of employees [Mnon-downsizing = 3.66, SD = 1.35; Msurvivors = 3.75, SD = 1.04; t(46) = - 0.27; p = 0.79], nor for performance in period one [Mnon-downsizing = 64.67, SD = 37.46; Msurvivors = 70.79, SD = 35.62; t(46) = - 0.58; p = 0.56]. This indicates that the randomization was successful.

Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficients are shown in Alphas are based on the complete sample (i.e., survivors and non-downsized group) 45, Surviors (N = 24), ""n-D, employes in non-downsized group (N = 24); ""Dummy variable (0 = no downsizing); P1, before potential layoff; P2, after potential layof, identification was measured with 7 as highest and 1 as lowest value; performance is the number of correctly arranged sides; +p < 0.10; \*p < 0.05; \*\*p < 0.01.

To test Hypothesis 1 we used regression analyses. We control for identification in period one. Therefore, we regressed identification after period two on the same measure after period one and estimated effects by using the residuals. In line with Hypothesis 1, Table 2 (column 1) shows a negative impact of downsizing on employee performance (b = - 36.62, p < 0.01). That means, controlling for period one performance, employees' performance after downsizing was about 37 sliders lower compared to the non-downsizing condition. By design, the employer's decision for downsizing does not relate to omitted characteristics of his or her employees. As we compare period two performance between the downsizing and the non-downsizing group, also learning or fatigue cannot explain the results. Having found a survivor effect we proceed with testing identification as an explanation for the main effect.

We tested Hypotheses 2 and 3 by using the custom dialog tool PROCESS for SPSS (Hayes, 2013). The logic of the mediation model is as follows: we decompose the relationship between downsizing and performance in an indirect and a direct effect. The indirect effect (Hypothesis 3), i.e., the amount of the survivor effect that can be explained by changes in identification, is calculated by multiplying the path from downsizing to identification (first path, Hypothesis 2) with the path from identification to performance (second path). The direct effect is the (remaining) relationship between downsizing and performance when identification is controlled for.

Hypothesis 2 states that downsizing negatively affects identification with the employer. Thus, we regressed identification with the employer on downsizing (see Table 2, column 2). Controlling for identification in period one, we find that downsizing relates to a 1.42 point decrease in identification with the employer (p < 0.01). In other words, depending on the downsizing decision, identification with the employer differs by roughly one standard deviation of the initial level.

For testing both, the path from identification to performance and the direct effect, we regressed performance on downsizing and identification (see Table 2, column 3). We find a marginally significant relationship between identification and performance (b = 11.53, p = 0.08 two-sided; note that as our hypothesis was directed, one-sided tests resulting in significance on the 5% level could also have been applied). In line with our mediation hypothesis, the relationship between downsizing and performance is no longer significant when identification with the employer is controlled for (direct effect, b = - 18.81, p = 0.20).

We estimated the confidence interval of the indirect effect (-1.42 × 11.53 ~ - 16.34, bias corrected 95% confidence interval = - 36.54 to -2.72) by estimating 1000 bootstrap samples (see Hayes, 2013). In support of Hypothesis 3, we find that the relationship between downsizing and performance is mediated by identification with the employer (see Figure 1; note that the small difference in the overall relationships, b = - 35.15 in the mediation vs. b = - 36.62 in Table 2, column 1, results from missing data on identification for one participant).

To be sure that preexisting differences do not bias our results we controlled for period one measures of performance and identification. A mediation analysis without controlling for the period one variable reveals the same pattern of results - except that the overall relationship and the path from identification to performance are significant on the 5% level, the indirect effect is significant on the 1% level.

In an exploratory way, we tested whether downsizing interacts with identification with the employer or with identification with the group of employees, respectively (both in period one). We found no effects. Overall, 12 employers opted for downsizing and 8 employers kept all their employees. However, employers' decisions cannot be predicted by their identification with the group of employees.

# DISCUSSION

We find causal evidence for the survivor syndrome, i.e., a negative effect of downsizing on employee performance. More importantly, however, our study provides evidence that the survivor syndrome can be explained by detrimental effects of downsizing on employees' identification with their employer.

Our results support studies indicating adverse effects of downsizing on employees' attitudes and behavior in the field (Brockner et al., 1988; Armstrong-Stassen et al., 1996; Armstrong-Stassen, 1998; Amabile and Conti, 1999; Allen et al., 2001; Brockner et al., 2004; Travaglione and Cross, 2006) but they provide important evidence for the causal direction in a controlled environment.

Downsizing and non-downsizing groups were highly comparable and there is no common method bias. Although the experimental approach appears to be somewhat artificial, the experimental situation was real for the study participants. They were confronted with actual earnings and losses, respectively, and downsizing was based on ""real"" decisions without the use of cover stories or other forms of deception. As we found causal evidence in a controlled environment, our experiment strengthens also the validity of existing field studies that mostly come with the problem that they do not allow causal inferences and/or focus on either performance declines or changes in worker commitment after downsizing but do rarely combine these constructs in a single study.

Our research addresses downsizing as a research gap in the social identity literature. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first who examine both, effects of downsizing on identification and, in turn, effects of identification on performance. Thus, we are the first who provide empirical evidence for identification as a central explanation for the survivor syndrome together with evidence for the causal direction.

## Managerial Implications

Our results suggest that firms considering downsizing should account for costs resulting from detrimental behavior of survivors. Although we focused on performance, we would expect that in the field lower identification might also affect other behavior, such as OCB, creativity, deviance, or turnover intentions. These costs could be a reason why previous studies often found no positive effects of downsizing on firm performance (see Datta et al., 2010).

Effects might be especially strong if downsizing itself contradicts the firm's identity. If, for example, workers internalize a history of non-downsizing as an integral part of their firm's identity, downsizing will probably have a pronounced effect on identification. We assume that effects of downsizing on survivors' identification also depend on the rationale behind and necessity of downsizing. Thus, compared to pure profit maximization, layoffs due to well-justified turnarounds may have smaller negative effects on identification.

Derived from the theoretical argument that social identification satisfies needs for esteem and predictability (Tajfel and Turner, 1979; Hogg and Terry, 2000), managers should aim to satisfy these needs to sustain employee identification also in the context of downsizing. Thus, if downsizing processes follow a long-term strategy, managers should outline the change process as an investment in the organization's competitiveness and efficiency, in other words, as an investment in future success and reputation (see Rousseau, 1998). Predictability might be strengthened by early and honest communication. Also participation may increase predictability and may prevent the gossip factory to become employees' primary source of information. Good leadership might contribute to the stabilization of identification. For instance, leader-memberexchange and, consequently, organizational support were found to predict organizational identification (Sluss et al., 2008).

However, maintaining identification during downsizing seems difficult. To avoid detrimental effects on firms and employees, we recommend firms to reduce layoffs to a minimum - if they downsize at all (see for an economic cost-benefit analysis of downsizing Birati and Tziner, 2000). Firms can, for instance, make use of fluctuation instead of laying off workers or make offers for voluntary leaves. When downsizing seems to be the best or only option, managers should provide support to the employees - both to those who are leaving (e.g., by showing a genuine interest in the well-being and future and by helping them finding a new job) and who are staying (e.g., by helping them cope with the new situation which may also involve more stress). This suggestion is in line with the findings by Sluss et al. (2008)

as discussed above and also with the results of Lee and Corbett (2006) who argue that perceptions of interactional justice (i.e., fair and supportive supervisor behavior) can offset the potential negative effects of employee perceptions of low distributive justice due to the downsizing. Finally, it is important that supervisors and leaders provide a sense of ""projected continuity"" (Ullrich et al., 2005) when communicating the downsizing. This means that leaders need to make clear why the downsizing is necessary to sustain the success of the organization in the long run which helps employees to maintain a sense of identity.

## Limitations

As groups were treated equally and showed no differences up to the beginning of period two, effects on identification and performance must be caused by downsizing. As we did not manipulate identification directly, the downside of our operationalization is that we provide only correlative evidence for the relationship between identification and performance. Nevertheless, due to the consistency with theoretical predictions and previous meta-analyses, we are confident in our interpretation of the effect.

One may also question whether it is possible to study identification processes in a short-lived laboratory experiment such as ours. First, we would like to highlight, that studying identification in group who come together for the purpose of a laboratory experiment only is common practice in psychology research (see, for instance, recent experiments by Häusser et al., 2012; Frisch et al., 2014) and that we have therefore used the scale by Doosje et al. (1995) which has been developed to measure identification in such contexts. Secondly, we want to highlight that we followed the standard economic protocol, i.e., participants came to the laboratory not to earn course credits as is the typical incentive for psychology students to participate but they participated to earn real money and were working on real tasks etc. So, we believe that the setting and manipulation for the participants resembled some reality.

In a related manner, the fact that the employer could only decide either to downsize or not but not influence which specific employee was terminated may be criticized for not reflecting organizational reality. This is certainly true for individual decisions to terminate an employee's contract in a work group or smaller organization where the decision is (hopefully) based on that employee's past (under)performance and thus does not signal any unfairness or callousness of the employer. In large downsizing programs of big corporations, however, this is often not the case. Here, decisions to downsize are made in some central headquarter which either closes down entire locations or departments or asks mid level management to get rid of a certain proportion of the workforce. We believe that the attributions of (surviving) employees in these cases are similar to the ones our participants make toward the employers who decided to lay off one employee – simply to safe money and irrespectively of prior performance of the employees affected by this decision.

A final limitation may apply to the generalizability of an experimental realization of downsizing and identification. Although, compared to reality, the consequences of being laid off for our participants were small (for a meta-analysis

of psychological consequences of unemployment, see Paul and Moser, 2009), financial losses imposed on the victims were real. Furthermore, as indicated by a low correlation between identification and performance in the first phase, the meaning of identification seems to be low initially. However, identification became highly relevant in the second period. As in reality consequences of layoffs, social interactions and firm characteristics are much more intense, we suppose to rather have underestimated detrimental motivational effects of downsizing in this laboratory experiment.

## Future Research

Although it may be extremely difficult to find a firm (plus a control group) that would allow for a pre- and postinterventional measurement of identification and performance, it is important to replicate our mediation model in the field. For better understanding the foci of identification, future studies should test if the relationship between downsizing and performance is also mediated by organizational identification. Also identification with the group of employees received only little research attention in the context of downsizing. As we find no effects of identification with the employees, whereas Brockner et al. (1987) do, future research should discover conditions under which identification with the employees becomes relevant.

Finally, Kreiner and Ashforth (2004) have developed an expanded model of organizational identification which complements identification with the four problematic forms of disidentification, ambivalent identification, and neutral identification. In our study, we have only measured identification with the employer, but future research may also look into the effects downsizing might have on the other forms. One item of Kreiner and Ashforth's (2004) scale to measure disidentification, for instance, asks employees to indicate the degree to which the organization ""does shameful things"" – one can expect that downsizing, and particularly a downsizing program that is perceived as unfair and unnecessary will be considered as such a shameful thing and disidentification might go up after such a program. Similarly, the downsizing might also lead employees to become more ambiguous about the membership in such an organization which would increase ambivalent identification.

# CONCLUSION

Despite the limitations discussed above, we believe that our study can be a starting point for more research in this area that focuses on identity processes – which have been largely ignored in the past. The fact that our experimental design provides causal evidence for the negative effects of downsizing on employees' sense of identity is an important contribution. It is a step for applying this causal model to applied research exploring the link in less artificial but on the other hand somewhat ""weaker"" research designs such as cross-sectional surveys after the downsizing. It is also important, however, for organizational practice because it helps managers understand the negative side effects of programs designed to reduce costs but in the end risking increased costs because of adverse employee reactions.

Finally, we believe that the findings of our study can enrich social identity theorizing in organizational contexts. We have emphasized in the introduction, that social identification typically is associated with following the group's norms and aims - which, in organizations should typically translate into performance. The norms could be very different in different contexts, however, and it would be interesting to develop hypotheses about the results of similar negative effects of downsizing for employees with multiple identifications (e.g. toward organization and unions) or in service contexts where the employee may not so easily reduce his or her performance

73,25998280,"# Brain Correlates of the Interaction Between 5-HTTLPR and Psychosocial Stress Mediating Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Severity

Dennis van der Meer, M.Sc., Pieter J. Hoekstra, M.D., Ph.D., Marcel Zwiers, Ph.D., Maarten Mennes, Ph.D., Lizanne J. Schweren, M.Sc., Barbara Franke, Ph.D., Dirk J. Heslenfeld, Ph.D., Jaap Oosterlaan, Ph.D., Stephen V. Faraone, Ph.D., Jan K. Buitelaar, M.D., Ph.D., Catharina A. Hartman, Ph.D.

Objective: The serotonin transporter 5-HTTLPR genotype has been found to moderate the effect of stress on severity of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), with stronger effects of stress in carriers of the short allele than in individuals homozygous for the long allele. The underlying neurobiological mechanism of this gene-environment interaction in ADHD is unknown. The authors aimed to determine whether 5-HTTLPR moderates the effect of stress on brain gray matter volume and, if so, which brain regions mediate the effect of this gene-environment interaction on ADHD severity.

Method: Structural MRI, 5-HTTLPR genotype, and stress exposure questionnaire data were available for 701 adolescents and young adults participating in the multicenter ADHD cohort NeurolMAGE study (from 385 families; 291 with ADHD, 78 with subthreshold ADHD, 332 healthy comparison subjects; 55.8% male; average age: 17.0 years). ADHD symptom count was determined through multi-informant questionnaires. For the analysis, a whole-brain voxel-based

morphometry approach was combined with mediation analysis.

Results: Stress exposure was associated with significantly less gray matter volume in the precentral gyrus, middle and superior frontal gyri, frontal pole, and cingulate gyrus in S-allele carriers compared with participants homozygous for the L-allele. The association of this gene-environment interaction with ADHD symptom count was mediated by gray matter volume in the frontal pole and anterior cingulate gyrus.

Conclusions: 5-HTTLPR genotype moderates the effect of stress on brain regions involved in social cognitive processing and cognitive control. Specifically, regions important for cognitive control link this gene-environment interaction to ADHD severity.

AJP in Advance (doi: 10.1176/appi.ajp.2015.14081035)

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) results in most cases from the combined influence of multiple genetic and environmental risk factors of small effect size (1, 2). Research into the etiology of ADHD is further complicated by gene-environment interactions, whereby a person's genetic makeup in part determines reactivity to environmental influences (3).

The serotonin transporter gene (SERT, also known as SLC6A4) is a gene implicated in ADHD (1). This gene contains a variable number tandem repeat polymorphism in its promoter region (5-HTTLPR), consisting of a 14-repeat short variant (S-allele) and a 16-repeat long variant (L-allele) (4). There is a large body of literature documenting that 5-HTTLPR may moderate the effects of stress exposure on mood disorders (5). Animal models have provided evidence of a causal relation between this gene-environment interaction and a range of pathological behaviors (6). It has

also been shown to be involved in ADHD. We recently reported a stronger positive association between stress exposure and severity of ADHD in individuals carrying an S-allele than in those homozygous for the L-allele and found that this was independent of comorbid internalizing problems (7). In the present study, we aimed to further our understanding of these findings by investigating brain correlates of this gene-environment interaction in the same study cohort.

ADHD is characterized by a delay in brain maturation (8), and both 5-HTTLPR genotype and stress exposure have been shown to influence brain maturation (9, 10). MRI studies of both healthy individuals and those with internalizing problems have reported interaction effects between 5-HTTLPR genotype and stress exposure on limbic and frontal brain regions involved in (the regulation of) social and emotional behavior, including the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex (11–13). S-allele carriers have been shown to have less connectivity between these regions, associated with higher levels of anxiety, suggesting that less top-down control of frontal regions over subcortical structures underlies part of the behavioral correlates of the 5-HTTLPR genotype (14). Hypofunctioning of frontal regions and connected subcortical structures is also a hallmark of both stress exposure (15) and ADHD (16), indicating overlap in neurobiological correlates of 5-HTTLPR, stress, and ADHD.

Knowledge of how 5-HTTLPR moderates environmental risk factors for ADHD may eventually lead to prevention and treatment being better adjusted to patients' individual characteristics. The present study therefore aimed to determine 1) whether the interaction between stress and 5-HTTLPR genotype also affects brain gray matter volume and 2) which brain regions would mediate the effect of this gene-environment interaction on ADHD severity. To accomplish these aims, we performed a whole-brain voxel-based morphometry mediation analysis, with gene-environment interaction as predictor, gray matter volume as a mediator, and ADHD symptom count as outcome (see Figure 1). Based on previous literature (17), we expected that paralimbic regions would be most prominently involved in this gene-environment interaction. However, we are the first, to our knowledge, to study the brain correlates of this gene-environment interaction in relation to ADHD severity. For this reason, a whole-brain analysis was chosen above a region-of-interest approach, allowing for the identification of different or previously overlooked brain regions. The analyses were carried out in an adolescent and young adult sample (mean age=17.0 years [SD=3.6]) of individuals with ADHD, their unaffected siblings, and healthy comparison subjects, thus enabling analysis within a wide range of ADHD severity, in accordance with the continuous distribution of ADHD within the population (18).

# METHOD

## Participants and Protocol

Participants were selected from the NeuroIMAGE study (19), a follow-up of the Dutch part of the International Multicenter ADHD Genetics (IMAGE) study. NeuroIMAGE included 365 families with at least one child with ADHD and at least one biological sibling (regardless of ADHD diagnosis) and 148 comparison families with at least one child and without any formal or suspected ADHD diagnosis in any of the firstdegree family members. ADHD families were recruited through ADHD outpatient clinics in the regions of Amsterdam, Groningen, and Nijmegen (the Netherlands). Comparison families were recruited through primary schools and high schools in the same geographical regions. To be included in NeuroIMAGE, participants had to be of European Caucasian descent, to be between the ages of 5 and 30, to have an IQ ≥70, and to have no diagnosis of autism, epilepsy, general learning difficulties, brain disorders, or known genetic disorders. More information on the NeuroIMAGE study and its participants is available elsewhere (19).

#### FIGURE 1. The Mediation Model®

a Path A represents the association between the gene-environment interaction and gray matter volume, consistent with aim 1. Path B represents the association between gray matter volume and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptom count, which, in combination with path A, is used to assess how gray matter volume mediates the effect of the gene-environment interaction on ADHD symptom count (aim 2). Path C represents the effect of the gene-environment interaction on ADHD symptom count, which we previously reported (7).

All measurements were part of a comprehensive assessment protocol. Testing was carried out at either the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and Vrije Universiteit Medical Centre or the Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre and Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition, and Behavior in Nijmegen. Participants were motivated with short breaks and received €50.00 and a copy of their MRI scan at the end of the day. The study was approved by the regional ethics committee and the medical ethical committee of the Vrije Universiteit Medical Centre. All participants signed informed consent (parents signed informed consent for participants under age 12).

#### Assessment of ADHD

We constructed an ADHD symptom count based on the Conners' ADHD Rating Scales questionnaires (20). These questionnaires were completed by the parents and either a teacher (for children <18 years old) or the participants themselves (for those ≥18 years old). The Conners' Rating Scales provide operational definitions of each of the 18 ADHD symptoms defined in DSM-IV-TR. In this sample, the symptom count ranged from 0 to 18, with an average of 5.4. Crohnbach's alpha for this measure was 0.91.

The 701 participants who met the inclusion criteria and had structural MRI data available came from 385 families. A total of 291 participants from 233 families had a diagnosis of ADHD, 78 participants had subthreshold ADHD (i.e., they had ADHD symptoms without meeting the criteria for a full ADHD diagnosis, of whom 56 were siblings of participants with ADHD), and 332 were healthy comparison participants (of whom 154 were unaffected siblings of participants with ADHD). ADHD diagnoses were made in accordance with DSM-IV-TR criteria on the basis of a combination of a semistructured diagnostic interview, the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Present and Lifetime version (21), and the Conners' Rating Scales. In this sample, 97 participants had an oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder, 23 had an internalizing disorder, and 79 had a reading disorder. An extensive description of the diagnostic algorithm for ADHD and comorbid disorders is provided in Appendix A in the data supplement accompanying the online version of this article.

## Assessment of Stress Exposure

Two questionnaires were used to assess the amount of exposure to psychosocial stress. Parents completed the Long-Term Difficulties Inventory (22, 23), which contained 13 items measuring whether their children had been exposed to chronic stressors, such as a handicap, being bullied, having financial difficulties, or other persisting problems at home or school. They were asked to only report chronic, ongoing difficulties. In addition, participants themselves completed a Stressful Life Events Screening Questionnaire (22, 23), which contained 11 items on exposure to specific major stressful events in the past 5 years, such as death or serious illness of a loved one, physical or sexual abuse, or failure at something important to them. For the composite stress measure, the scores on the questionnaires were transformed to z values and averaged according to common practice for aggregating similar measures, as previously described elsewhere (7). For additional information on both questionnaires and an overview of the items, see Appendix B in the online data supplement.

## Genotyping

Genotyping was performed as described by Brookes et al. (24). Briefly, DNA was extracted from blood samples at Rutgers University Cell and DNA Repository (Piscataway, N.J.). Standard polymerase chain reaction protocols were used for the determination of 5-HTTLPR genotype.

# Socioeconomic Status

As a measure of socioeconomic status, the highest successfully completed education level of the parents was recoded into a measure reflecting years of education. This scale contained nine levels, ranging from 0 (no formal education) to 17 (university education) years of education (25). The average of both parents was used, which in this sample ranged from 5 to 17 years, with an average of 12.1 years.

## MRI Data Acquisition and Preprocessing

Both scanning locations used two identical 1.5-T scanners. For each participant, two high-resolution T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo anatomical scans were obtained (176 sagittal slices, repetition time=2,730 ms, echo time=2.95 ms, voxel size=1.0×1.0×1.0 mm, field of view=256 mm). Before processing, raw scans were manually evaluated for motion artifact and scan quality. Only scans with no or mild motion artifact were selected for further analysis. To increase signal-to-noise, scans from the same participant were averaged if they both contained no or

This included normalization to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, segmentation into tissue-specific maps, modulation by dividing the images through the nonlinear component of the Jacobian determinant of the warp, and smoothing with an 8-mm full width at half maximum Gaussian kernel.

## Statistical Analysis

This study investigated a dominant genetic model of the 5-HTTLPR S-allele, wherein S-allele carriers were coded as ""1"" and L-allele homozygotes were coded as ""O."" This is in accordance with the majority of studies investigating this gene-environment interaction (5) and is based on the functional effects of the S- and L-alleles (4). In addition, L-alleles with the rs25531 C-G single-nucleotide polymorphism were recoded as a functional S-allele, in accordance with previous studies (26). This led to 59 L-allele homozygotes being recoded as S-allele carriers. Compliance of genotype distribution with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was checked using standard methods.

All behavioral data were analyzed using R v3.1.1 (27). Differences between genotypes in sample demographic characteristics were checked for categorical variables with Pearson's chi-square tests and for continuous variables with one-way analysis of variance. The model investigating the effect of the gene-environment interaction on ADHD symptom count consisted of 5-HTTLPR genotype, stress exposure, and their interaction, as well as age, gender, socioeconomic status, and location as covariates. In order to account for the within-family correlation because of the inclusion of siblings in the sample, we analyzed the data with linear mixed-effects models with family as a random factor, estimating a random intercept. The p values of the mixed models results were estimated through a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, included in the languageR package.

# Whole-Brain Voxel-Based Morphometry Mediation Analysis

We employed mediation effect parametric mapping (28) to determine the relationship between the gene-environment interaction, gray matter volume, and ADHD symptom count. This analysis technique is based on a standard three-variable mediation model, as shown in Figure 1. Here, path ""a"" represents the association of the predictor X with the mediator M; path ""b"" represents the effect of the mediator M on the dependent variable Y; and path ""c"" represents the total effect of the predictor X on the dependent variable Y. The mediation

ª Differences between genotypes in the categorical variables location and gender were analyzed with a chi-square test; for continuous variables, an analysis of variance was performed. A variant of this table on demographic characteristics, providing the statistics for homozygotes and heterozygotes separately, is presented in Appendix E in the online data supplement.

effect (i.e., the effect of X on Y mediated by M) is the product of path ""a"" and path ""b,"" the significance of which is determined through bootstrapping. This approach to mediation analysis is in line with the currently most accepted approach to mediation, which deviates from the classic ""causal steps"" approach to mediation, as the latter has been shown to be less powerful and rest on false assumptions (29).

Our whole-brain mediation model consisted of 5-HTTLPR genotype, amount of stress exposure, and their interaction as predictors, gray matter volume as a mediator, and ADHD symptom count as a dependent variable. Gender, age, socioeconomic status, and scanner location were added as covariates. All continuous predictors were mean-centered.

The whole-brain mediation analysis on the voxel-based morphometry data was performed in MATLAB with the Multilevel Mediation and Moderation Toolbox (28). As a mask, we used the average gray matter image of the sample with an absolute threshold value of 0.2 (number of voxels: 463,956). The toolbox performed a bootstrap test (5,000 samples), to estimate the significance of the effect on each voxel included in the mask, resulting in p value maps for paths ""a,"" ""b,"" and ""ab."" Family-wise error correction was applied through the use of FSL's [Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain Software Library] EasyThresh, which carries out cluster-based thresholding. A z value of 2.6 was used to define contiguous clusters, and subsequently each cluster's significance level was estimated on the basis of Gaussian random field theory. Those clusters surviving a significance threshold of a p value set at 0.001 are reported. Localization was done with the Harvard-Oxford Atlas. All reported coordinates are in MNI space and in millimeters.

In order to further probe the interaction and mediation effects, as well as to correct for the nonindependence of the data, mean gray matter volume from significant clusters was extracted and analyzed with linear-mixed effects models in R, as described above for the behavioral data. Significance of the mediation effect was determined through bootstrapping with 5,000 samples. We further calculated Cohen's F,

suitable for mixed models (30), as a measure of additional percentage variance explained by the gene-environment interaction term. For the mediation effects, we report k2 as a ratio measure of the indirect effect compared with its maximal possible value (31).

# Sensitivity Analyses

We conducted sensitivity analyses to check whether the findings were not biased as a result of methodological choices. We checked whether the findings were not driven by either a diagnostic sub-

group or testing location, by rerunning the analyses with an interaction term between the gene-environment interaction and either diagnosis or testing location and checking whether these interaction terms had significant effects on gray matter volume. Additional information on the methods for these analyses is presented in Appendix C in the online data supplement. Furthermore, given the large age range, we checked whether age played a significant role in the association of the gene-environment interaction with ADHD symptom count by adding a three-way interaction to the model.

# RESULTS

## Demographic Characteristics

No significant differences in gender distribution, age, stress exposure, socioeconomic status, or testing location were found between S-allele carriers and L-allele homozygotes, as summarized in Table 1. Genotyping frequencies did not deviate from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p=0.11).

# Association of the Interaction Between 5-HTTLPR and Stress With ADHD Symptom Count

There was no evidence of an association of genotype or stress with ADHD symptom count, as previously reported in a sample from which the present sample is a subset (7). The interaction effect was significant (B=0.80, SE=0.38, p=0.03), indicating that 5-HTTLPR genotype moderated the effect of stress exposure on ADHD symptom count. Within-group analysis confirmed that stress was highly and significantly correlated with ADHD symptom count in S-allele carriers (B=0.80, SE=0.24, p<0.001) but not in L-allele homozygotes.

# Association of the Interaction Between 5-HTTLPR and Stress With Gray Matter Volume

The association between stress and gray matter volume was moderated by 5-HTTLPR genotype in the precentral gyrus,

middle and superior frontal gyrus, frontal pole, and paracingulate gyrus (Figure 2). In these regions, S-allele carriers had a more pronounced negative correlation between stress and gray matter volume than L-allele homozygotes. Information on the clusters is presented in Table 2. Given our focus on the gene-environment interaction, significant clusters from the conditional main effects are presented in Appendix D in the online data supplement.

#### The Whole-Brain Mediation Analysis

The mediation analysis revealed two clusters, one in the anterior cingulate and paracingulate gyrus and one in the frontal pole. These clusters are shown in Figure 2. Further inspection of our results revealed that the pattern was the same across both clusters: there was a negative correlation between the interaction term and gray matter volume (path a) and a negative correlation between gray matter volume and ADHD symptom count (path b), leading to a significant positive (path a by path b) mediation effect. That is, the stronger positive correlation between stress and ADHD symptom count found in S-allele carriers compared with L-allele homozygotes was in part statistically explained by less volume in these frontal brain regions. This, and further, information on the clusters is summarized in Table 3.

## Sensitivity Analyses

Age was not significantly correlated with symptom count. However, it was associated with stress, with older participants having experienced more stress (r=0.21, p<0.0001), and with total gray matter volume, with younger participants having more gray matter (r =- 0.18, p<0.0001), as would be expected given that pruning of gray matter takes place with increasing age. We added a three-way interaction between the gene-environment interaction and age on ADHD symptom count to check whether this played a significant role in our findings. The gene-environment interaction effect remained significant (B=0.92, SE=0.39, p=0.02), whereas none of the other two-way or three-way interactions were significant. Results from the other sensitivity analyses are presented in Appendix C in the data supplement. Briefly, we found no evidence that diagnosis or testing location influenced the effects of the gene-environment interaction on gray matter volume in any of the significant clusters from the main analysis.

## DISCUSSION

We aimed to identify brain gray matter volume correlates of the interaction between 5-HTTLPR and stress exposure and to examine whether gray matter volume mediates the effect of this gene-environment interaction on ADHD severity. To achieve this, we combined a whole-brain voxel-based morphometry approach with mediation analysis. We found that stress exposure was associated with significantly less gray matter volume in the precentral gyrus, middle and superior frontal gyri, frontal pole, and paracingulate gyrus in S-allele carriers compared with participants homozygous for the L-allele. The association of this gene-environment interaction with ADHD symptom count was mediated by gray matter volume in the frontal pole and anterior cingulate gyrus.

Assuming that less gray matter volume is unfavorable, our findings would indicate that S-allele carriers are more sensitive to stress, in accordance with our previous findings on ADHD severity at the behavioral level (7), as well as with the majority of studies of the link between this gene-environment interaction with anxiety and depression (5). Because of the reported association between this gene-environment interaction and internalizing disorders, neuroimaging studies of 5-HTTLPR and its moderation of stress effects have mostly employed a region-of-interest approach focusing on limbic regions such as the amygdala (17). However, whole-brain structural and functional MRI studies have linked this

gene-environment interaction to a brain network involved more broadly in social cognitive processing and emotion regulation (12, 32). This network includes the precentral gyrus and anterior cingulate and paracingulate gyri, regions also reported in the present study. We further found an association with gray matter volume in the frontal pole and superior and middle frontal gyri. These regions, together with the anterior cingulate gyrus, are essential for cognitive control, such as suppressing automatic emotional reactions in favor of more flexible goal-directed behavior (33). This includes control over the amygdala (33), which is in line with reports that top-down control of the anterior cingulate over the amygdala is central to the association of 5-HTTLPR with anxiety and depression (14).

The present findings speak to the idea that in the context of ADHD, 5-HTTLPR, and its moderation of the effects of stress, is more broadly involved in self-regulation problems above and beyond the regulation of anxiety and sad affect. We found that the stronger negative association between stress and gray matter volume in the frontal pole and anterior cingulate gyrus in S-allele carriers compared with L-allele homozygotes mediated the association between this gene-environment interaction and ADHD severity. Prefrontal cortex dysfunction, and associated problems with cognitive control, is a hallmark of ADHD (16); neuroimaging studies have repeatedly reported less volume and lower activity across the frontal lobes in individuals with ADHD compared with healthy comparison subjects (34). The results from the present study suggest that the interaction between 5-HTTLPR and stress exposure may contribute to these structural and functional deficits of the prefrontal cortex in ADHD. As described above, 5-HTTLPR and stress have been linked to social cognitive processing (35) and cognitive control, both the anterior cingulate and frontal pole

are important for cognitive control in socioemotional situations (33, 36), and cognitive control problems in ADHD manifest in academic (37), social (38), or emotional (39) contexts. We therefore hypothesize that this geneenvironment interaction may be linked to ADHD through its effect on broadly defined self-regulation problems.

Strengths of this study include a large sample size, use of multiple informants to determine ADHD phenotype, and the application of a whole-brain moderated mediation analysis that allowed for assessment of the neural pathways coupling the geneenvironment interaction with ADHD severity. Limitations

of this study are the retrospective assessment of stress exposure and the observational, cross-sectional design, the latter preventing strong inferences about causality. For instance, it could be the case that the reported gray matter volume differences are a causal factor in maladaptive behavior, which in turn may lead to the experience of more stressful live events. While animal studies have provided causal evidence that the brain of S-allele carriers is more affected by exposure to stress, longitudinal studies or studies making use of ""natural experiments"" (40) are needed to confirm this causality in humans.

In summary, we demonstrated that 5-HTTLPR moderates the effects of stress at the neural level, such that S-allele carriers show a more negative association between stress and gray matter volume than L-allele homozygotes. The implicated brain regions have been linked to social cognition, emotion regulation, and more broadly defined cognitive control functions. The anterior cingulate gyrus and frontal pole, regions important for cognitive control, statistically mediate the association between the gene-environment interaction and ADHD severity in adolescence and young adulthood. Our findings suggest that the interaction between 5-HTTLPR and stress may render individuals vulnerable to broadly defined self-regulation problems and that this mechanism is not only relevant for internalizing symptoms of anxiety and depression but also for ADHD symptoms. These findings have implications for both clinicians and researchers. Clinicians may eventually use information on the moderating effects of patients' genotypes to shape their prevention and treatment strategies to individual patients' needs; S-allele carriers may benefit more from preventing stressful experiences and treatments in order to better regulate their behavior, although more research is needed to confirm this. For researchers, these findings underline the fact that genetic and environmental factors do not operate in isolation and need to be studied in context. Such approaches are a step forward in resolving heterogeneity of ADHD and its underlying mechanisms. Our findings also suggest that future research may need to consider a broader role for this geneenvironment interaction in shaping behavior than previously assumed, with effects on cognitive control. Because the brain regions reported in this study are complex and serve multiple functions, future studies should further specify how the interaction between 5-HTTLPR and stress exposure affects neurocognitive functioning and how this relates to ADHD.

## A B S T R A C T

Exposure to childhood maltreatment increases the risk of developing mental illness later in life. Childhood maltreatment and depression have both been associated with dysregulation of the hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis-a key regulator of the body's stress response. Additionally, HPA axis dysregulation has been implicated in the etiology of a range of mental illnesses. A substantial body of work has shown history of childhood maltreatment alters DNA methylation levels within key HPA axis genes. We therefore investigated whether one of these key genes, FKBP5 mediates the relationship between childhood maltreatment and depression, and assessed FKBP5 DNA methylation and gene expression within 112 adults from the Detroit Neighborhood Health Study (DNHS). DNA methylation was assessed in 4 regions, including the upstream promoter, downstream promoter, and two glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) via pyrosequencing using whole blood derived DNA: Tagman assays measured relative RNA expression from leukocytes. Mediation analyses were conducted using sequential linear regression. Childhood maltreatment was significantly associated with depression symptom severity (FDR < 0.006), but was not a significant predictor of DNA methylation in any of the four loci examined. FKBP5 showed elevated expression levels in participants with vs. without a history of depression (p < 0.001); no significant difference in gene expression levels was observed in relation to childhood maltreatment (p > 0.05). Our results suggest DNA methylation does not mediate the childhood maltreatmentdepression association in the DNHS.

# 1. Introduction

Adverse early life experiences, such as childhood maltreatment (CM), increase susceptibility for developing depression (Hussey et al., 2006; Nanni et al., 2012; Nelson et al., 2017), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (Stein et al., 1996), bipolar

disorder (Afifi et al., 2008), and other mental health disorders (MacMillan et al., 2001; Martin-Blanco et al., 2014; McGowan et al., 2009) in adulthood. In addition, exposure to CM has been shown to dysregulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, a master regulator of the body's stress response (reviewed in (Van Voorhees and Scarpa, 2004)). Substantial work has demonstrated that dysregulation of the HPA axis increases the likelihood of developing mood and anxiety disorders (Appel et al., 2011; Ceulemans et al., 2011; Espejo et al., 2007; Guerry and Hastings, 2011; Nemeroff, 2004). Moreover, it has been well-documented that exposures during early life, including CM, impact DNA methylation (5mC) levels within genes of the HPA axis (Martin-

Blanco et al., 2014; McGowan et al., 2009; Romens et al., 2015; van der Knaap et al., 2014) making the HPA axis a logical starting point for studies examining the epigenetic impact of CM.

FK506 Binding Protein 5 (FKBP5) is a gene whose product is involved in HPA axis function by negatively regulating the stress response. The HPA axis is activated by stress and is regulated by two levels of negative feedback: long range and ultra-short intracellular feedback loops. Long range feedback occurs when high levels of cortisol in the blood stream are detected by the hypothalamus, resulting in decreased excretion of corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) and subsequent tamping down of the stress response (Binder, 2009; Binder et al., 2008; Davies et al., 2002; Yang et al., 2012). Ultra-short feedback occurs at the cellular level and involves FKBP5, which acts as a negative regulator of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) (Appel et al., 2011; Binder, 2009; Binder et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2012). The presence of FKBP5, when bound to a multi-protein chaperone complex in the cytoplasm, lowers the binding affinity between cortisol and the GR (Binder, 2009). When cortisol is able to successfully bind to the GR, the GR-cortisol complex translocates into the nucleus, where it binds to glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) (Binder et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2012) and acts as a transcription factor to upregulate FKBP5 transcription. Increased expression of FKBP5 reduces GR sensitivity, leading to more unbound cortisol in the cytoplasm and in the blood, thereby activating the long feedback loop (Binder, 2009).

Despite FKBP5's prominent role in the regulation of the stress response, relatively few studies have examined the relationship between CM and FKBP5 5mC in humans. Klengel et al. (2013). examined FKBP5 5mC in participants with a history of childhood trauma compared to a control group. They reported significantly decreased 5 mC at several glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) and a significant interaction between childhood trauma exposure and genetic variation at rs1360780 to predict 5 mC at intron 7 (Klengel et al., 2013). A second study, by Tyrka et al. examined the association of CM and FKBP5 5 mC at intron 7 in a cohort of preschool aged children, and found significantly decreased FKBP5 5mC of two CpG sites within intron 7 and found no significant interaction between SNP rs1360780 and lifetime contextual stress on FKBP5 5mC of intron 7 (Tyrka et al., 2015). A third study in children, by Weder et al. employed a genome-wide approach using Illumina's 450K Bead Chip to examine 5mC and more broadly the relationship between CM and depression (Weder et al., 2014). They reported significant differences among CM cases compared to controls at several CpG sites within FKBP5. However, due to the incomplete coverage of the FKBP5 region by the 450K array, the region examined in the two earlier studies was not assessed.

Two additional groups have examined FKBP5 5mC in relation to other stressful life events. Honhe et al. examined the impact of psychosocial stress on FKBP5 5mC and gene expression (GE) within the context of major depression history and FKBP5 genotype. They found a significant interaction of SNP genotype at rs1360780 and depression status on FKBP5 5mC of intron 7, however this finding did not survive multiple test corrections (Hohne et al., 2015). Lastly, Non et al. found the length of time in institutionalized care was significantly negatively correlated with FKBP5 intron 7 CpG site 1 5mC after correcting for multiple hypothesis testing (Non et al., 2016).

These studies reported significantly different FKBP5 5mC associated with either exposure to CM or major depression, however none of them directly examined the relationship among CM, 5mC, and depression-yet, given the demonstrated relationship between CM and 5mC, as well as differential 5mC in relation to depression in FKBP5 (Hohne et al., 2015) and other HPA axis genes (Na et al., 2014; Nantharat et al., 2015; Tyrka et al., 2012), a plausible relation exists among these factors. To address this possibility, we examined whether FKBP5 5mC mediates the relationship between CM and depression, and if the altered 5mC subsequently influences GE levels of FKBP5. Our primary analyses focused on the introns implicated in previous work as being influenced by CM (Klengel et al., 2013; Tyrka et al., 2015), while the FKBP5 promoter region analyses reflect a smaller exploratory dataset that tested more canonical influences of 5mC on GE.

# 2. Methods

#### 2.1. Participant selection

The Detroit Neighborhood Health Study (DNHS) was approved by the institutional review board at the University of Michigan and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Participants were selected from the DNHS, a longitudinal, population-based representative sample of adult residents from Detroit, MI (Goldmann et al., 2011; Uddin et al., 2010). All participants provided informed consent prior to participation. Selection for inclusion in this study was based on the availability of whole-blood derived DNA, leukocyte-derived RNA, and complete survey data regarding CM and depression histories. The full sample (N = 112) was tested for intron 2 and intron 7, and a subset of participants (N = 72) was selected for the promoter region assays.

#### 2.2. Childhood maltreatment

CM history was collected via structured telephone interviews assessing the severity, duration, and frequency of each event type. Assessment of CM was based on an adaptation of the Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS) (Straus, 1979) and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) (Bernstein et al., 1997), as previously described (Keyes et al., 2012; Uddin et al., 2013). CTS items assessed physical and emotional abuse before age 11, with responses rated on a 5point scale. CTQ assessed physical and sexual abuse before age 18, rating responses on a 3-point scale. In this study, a binary variable of CM exposure was used, such that CM exposure (N = 56) was defined as any individual belonging to the upper quartile for CM score within the full wave 2 DNHS survey sample (N = 1588). Participants without exposure to CM (N = 56) belonged to the bottom quartile of CM score within the full wave 2 DNHS survey sample.

#### 2.3. Depression measure

Depression symptom severity (depSS) scores were based on participant responses from the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) (Kroenke et al., 2001), rated on a 4-point scale for each of the 9 questions with each question ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day); and total depression severity scores ranging from 0 to 27 as described in (Uddin et al., 2013). Lifetime major depressive disorder (MDD) was assessed at each wave of the DNHS using the PHQ-9, with additional questions to assess the timing and duration of symptoms, consistent with DSM-IV criteria (American Psychiatric, 1994) and previously validated (Uddin et al., 2011) Participant depression information was taken from the same wave as the participants' biospecimens tested in the experiments described below. In this study, the continuous measure of depSS was used in the regression models. Within the GE analyses MDD was defined as history of lifetime MDD.

## 2.4. Antidepressant medication

Participant medication information was obtained during the inhome visit at the time of biologic sample collection and has been described previously (Bustamante et al., 2016) and is included in the regressions as a covariate.

# 2.5. Genotype

Participant genotype of FKBP5 SNP rs1360780 was imputed from data collected by the Illumina HumanOmniExpress BeadChip. PLINK (Purcell et al., 2007) was used to impute the genotype of rs1360780 for the DNHS participants. A subset of the study participants (N = 100) had available genotype information.

# 2.6. Sample preparation

# 2.6.1. DNA and RNA collection

Whole blood was collected via venipuncture from study participants during scheduled in-home visits by a phlebotomist. DNA was isolated from whole blood and concentration was verified via Nanodrop 1000 (Thermofisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) as previously described (Bustamante et al., 2016). RNA was isolated from leukocytes and subjected to the following criteria to ensure high quality RNA was obtained, including a RNA integrity number (RIN) >5, 28s/18s > 1.0, and 260/280 > 1.7 (Fleige and Pfaffl, 2006; Fleige et al., 2006). RNA sample RIN values and 28s/18s ratios were calculated using the 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Wilmington, DE) to determine RNA quality.

# 2.6.2. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell counts

At the time of blood draw, two FICOLL gradient containing 8 ml BD Vacutainers CPT™ with sodium citrate (Franklin Lakes, NJ) were used for the collection of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples and processed as previously described (Bustamante et al., 2016).

# 2.6.3. Bisulfite conversion

Using Qiagen's Epitect Bisulfite Kit, 750 ng of participant DNA was bisulfite converted following the manufacturer's recommended protocol. Negative controls containing RNAse/DNAse free water in place of DNA were included with each bisulfite conversion. High and low methylation control DNA purchased from Zymo Research (Irvine, CA) was bisulfite converted along with the participant samples in order to assess assay performance.

## 2.7. PCR amplification & pyrosequencing

5mC upstream of the transcription start site (TSS) (CHR6:35,656,797-35,656,920), downstream of of the TSS (CHR6:35,655,829–35,655,843), and introns 2 (CHR6:35,558,310 —35,558,785) and 7 (CHR6:35,607,754—35,608,049) of FKBP5 were assessed via pyrosequencing. These regions were targeted in part based on: (i) previous work within FKBP5 (intron 2 and 7 (Klengel et al., 2013):), and (ii) previous work demonstrating an association between early life adversity and 5mC in promoter regions of related HPA axis genes (i.e. NR3C1 (Oberlander et al., 2008; Tyrka et al., 2012)). All assay files were designed and created using the Pyro-Mark Q24 Assay Design Software 2.0 (Qiagen). 5mC of FKBP5's Intron 2 and 7, which encompass GREs, has been previously investigated by (Klengel et al., 2013; Tyrka et al., 2015; Yehuda et al., 2015a) (Fig. 1). PCR and pyrosequencing primers for Intron 2 and 7 have been previously described in (Klengel et al., 2013). Due to the read length of the assay associated with the intron 7 primers developed by Klengel et al. intron 7 CpG 3 methylation data was not reliably obtained; therefore, a new sequencing primer for Intron 7 CpG 3 was designed and used with the amplicon amplified by the PCR primers as described by (Klengel et al., 2013). The two intron 2 CpG sites are both located near a consensus GRE sequence, ~552bp

away. Within intron 7 CpG sites 1 and 3 surround the consensus GRE sequence: CpG 1 is 15bp away from the closest GRE consensus sequence, and CpG 3 is 47bp away from the same GRE consensus sequence; in contrast, CpG 2 is located within the consensus GRE sequence. Within the promoter region, two separate loci were examined. The first was a ready-made Qiagen assay targeting 3 CpG sites within intron 1 and overlapped a CpG island TSS, denoted as downstream promoter (Fig. 1). The second was newly developed using the PyroMark Q24 Assay Design Software 2.0 (Qiagen). The newly developed primer set encompassed 11 CpG sites within several transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) including EGR-1, and overlapped a CpG island upstream of the TSS, denoted as upstream promoter (Fig. 1).

All PCR and sequencing primers were validated according to the recommendations in the PyroMark manual to ensure high quality primers were used. Additionally, each primer set was tested using commercially available Human high and low methylation control DNA (Zymo Research) that was bisulfite converted on site. For each locus examined, the high methylation control DNA averages and ranges were: 91.1% for the upstream promoter with methylation ranging from 74% to 100%; 96.7% for the downstream promoter ranging from 92% to 100%; 76.1% for intron 2, ranging from 67% to 85%; and 96.4% for intron 7 ranging from 93% to 100%. The low methylation control DNA averages and ranges were: 8% for the upstream promoter, with methylation ranging from 2% to 32%; 6.6% for the downstream promoter ranging from 5% to 8%; 27.9% for intron 2, ranging from 27% to 30% intron 2; and 60.6% for intron 7 ranging from 54% to 68%. Bisulfite converted participant DNA was amplified using Qiagen's PyroMark PCR kit for all four loci of FKBP5 examined in this study. PCRs were run in duplicate and contained 20 ng of bisulfite converted participant DNA as starting template. No template controls were run in duplicate and were included with each set of PCRs as a negative control as they did not contain any DNA. Qiagen's PyroMark Q24 Pyrosequencer was used to detect 5mC levels following manufacturer's protocols and default settings.

#### 2.8. Reverse transcription & real-time PCR

FKBP5 mRNA expression levels were assessed in participants with available total RNA (N = 71). Total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA following the manufacturer's protocol using the High Capacity Reverse Transcription Kit purchased from Applied BioSystems (Foster City, CA). Ready-made Taqman GE assays (Applied Biosystems) were used to measure relative transcript levels of the target gene FKBP5 (Hs015610061\_m1 ) and the control gene TATA Binding Protein, TBP (Hs00427621\_m1) run in separate wells. Reactions were performed in triplicate for each participant. Each reaction was 20 µl and contained 10 ng of participant cDNA for both the test and control genes. Reactions were run on the HT7500 Fast Real-Time PCR machine (Applied BioSystems, Foster City, CA) following the manufacturer's recommended protocol.

# 2.9. Pyrosequencing data analysis

5mC levels were averaged across CpG sites within each of the four tested loci (upstream promoter, downstream promoter, intron 2, and intron 7). This step was performed based on the assumption that CpG sites within a functional region, such as the promoter region, a TFBS, or a GRE are correlated, based on previous empirical evidence (Jones, 2012). Additionally, the composition of CpG sites within intron 2 and 7 that were averaged correspond to the CpGs included in the bins as reported by (Klengel et al., 2013). The distribution of averaged 5mC data obtained for each region was evaluated using boxplots, histograms, and tested for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality in IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 23.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY).

#### 2.9.1. Demographic statistics

Independent samples t-tests were used to test for bivariate associations between CM exposure and demographic covariates, as well as depression and demographic covariates. Chi-square tests were used to test for associations between CM exposure and the demographic variables of sex, race, and genotype. Similarly, Chisquare tests were used to test for the association between depression history and sex, race, and genotype. All statistical tests were two-tailed and results were considered significant when p < 0.05. Tests were conducted using SPSS version 23.0.

## 2.9.2. Mediation analyses

5mC, CM, and depSS information for each participant was used to carry out mediation analyses using linear regressions (Fig. 2). The analysis was performed using SPSS version 23.0, following criteria outlined in (Baron and Kenny, 1986). Specifically, we assessed whether: (a) CM is associated with depSS after controlling for confounders (i.e. age, sex, race, PBMC count, and antidepressant medication use); (b) CM is associated with FKBP5 5mC levels, after

controlling for confounders; (c) if FKBP5 5mC is a predictor of depSS, after controlling for confounders; and lastly, if a, b and c were significant, we tested (a'), i.e. if the effect of CM on depSS at FKBP5 regions is attenuated after controlling for 5 mC at those regions, as well as other confounders. All regression models included age, sex, self-reported race, PBMC count, and antidepressant medication information as covariates. A secondary analysis tested the potential interaction between CM and FKBP5 SNP rs1360780 within intron 7, as previously reported in (Klengel et al., 2013; Tyrka et al., 2015), in a subset of individuals with available genotype data (n = 100). For the model testing for an interaction, the main effect model was run first, followed by the interaction model. To address the concern of multiple hypothesis testing and potential Type I errors, the false discovery rate (FDR) was calculated as outlined in (Benjamini et al., 2001) such that results were accepted as significant when FDR < 0.006. Adjusted p-values are indicated by ""FDR"" and unadjusted p-values are indicated by ""p"".

# 2.9.3. Gene expression

Cycle threshold (CT) values for each sample were averaged across replicates to obtain a mean CT value for each participant used in our analysis. All data was examined for outliers, and any replicates with a standard deviation greater than 0.25 were removed (n = 5), and the mean CT was re-calculated from the remaining data points (Biosystems, 2016). GE data were analyzed using the comparative CT method (Schmittgen and Livak, 2008), normalizing FKBP5 GE against the control gene TBP. Normalized data were analyzed using the student's t-test to compare expression levels according to exposure to CM and depression history. In this secondary analysis, results were accepted as significant if p < 0.05.

## 2.9.4. Correlation analysis

Pearson correlations were used to further explore the potential relationship between FKBP5 GE and 5 mC at each of the four regions examined individually. Correlations were considered significant when p < 0.05. Tests were conducted using SPSS version 23.0.

## 3. Results

General descriptive statistics of the study sample are included in Table 1. Examination of the 5mC data revealed no extreme outliers. Participants with exposure to CM were not significantly different from those without CM exposure in terms of age, sex, self-reported race, genotype (rs1360780), PBMC count, or percent methylation (Table 1). There was a significant difference in CM score and depSS for participants with a history of CM exposure compared to those without such exposure (Table 1). Similarly, those with a history of depression had significantly different CM score and depSS compared to those with no reported history of depression (Table 1 ). A subset of the study participants (N = 100) had available genotype information; of these, 16 participants were homozygous for the T risk allele (i.e. TT), 41 participants were heterozygous CT, and 43 were homozygous CC. Participant genotypes were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p = 0.248). For SNP rs1360780, the major allele is C and the minor allele is T. The minor allele frequency according to the 1000 genomes project for rs1360780 is 0.3273 (Genomes Project et al., 2015), while in this dataset the imputed minor allele frequency among participants is 0.365.

# 3.1. Mediation analysis

# 3.1.1. Upstream promoter

All analyses of the promoter regions, both upstream and downstream, used the subsetted population of participants (N = 72, 36 CM cases). In the upstream promoter analyses, we first tested whether CM predicts depSS. CM was the sole significant predictor of depSS in this model (ß = 4.78 SE 1.11 p < 0.001 FDR = 0.005; Table S1a). The next linear regression model tested the relationship between CM and 5mC; neither our primary predictor (i.e. CM) nor any of the covariates were significantly associated with 5mC within this locus of the FKBP5 promoter region (Table S1b). The next regression model tested whether 5mC predicted depSS; no significant predictors or covariates were identified in this model (Table S1c). These results are summarized in Fig. 3A.

#### 3.1.2. Downstream promoter

As with the upstream promoter region results, CM was the sole significant predictor of depSS in this model CM (ß = 4.78 SE 1.11 p < 0.001 FDR = 0.005; Table S2a). Similarly, there was no significant relationship between CM or any of the covariates with 5mC; and, no significant predictors were observed in the model examining whether 5mC predicted depSS (Tables S2b-c). These results are summarized in Fig. 3b.

## 3.1.3. Intron 2

All analyses of the intronic regions, both introns 2 and 7, drew on the full sample population (N = 112, 56 CM cases). In the first model, CM (β = 4.47 SE 1.44 p = 0.002 FDR = 0.006) significantly predicted depSS (Table S3a). In the next models, CM was not a significant predictor of FKBP5 Intron 2 5mC (Table S3b), nor did FKBP5 intron 2 5mC predict depSS (Table S3c). These results are summarized in Fig. 3C.

#### 3.1.4. Intron 7

CM significantly predicted depSS (ß = 4.47 SE 1.44 p = 0.002 FDR = 0.006; Table S4a). Similar to intron 2, CM was not a significant predictor of FKBP5 Intron 7 5mC (Table S4b). In the next regression model, intron 7 5mC and other covariates did not significantly predict depSS (Table S4c). Participant genotype was available for a subset of participants (N = 100, 50 CM cases); inclusion of participant genotype (rs1360780) as an interactor with CM (as previously shown (Klengel et al., 2013)), did not alter the reported non-significant findings (Fig. 3d; Supplementary Table 4).

# 3.2. Gene expression of peripheral leukocytes

FKBP5 GE was examined separately for CM and lifetime MDD to discern the potential impact of each exposure. No significant (p > 0.05) differences in relative GE levels were observed between the CM exposed cases compared to the non-exposed controls. However, when comparing MDD cases and controls, we observed a significant increase in relative GE level among those with MDD vs. controls (p < 0.001) (Fig. 4).

#### 3.3. Correlation of gene expression and DNA methylation

The relationship between FKBP5 GE and 5 mC at each of the four regions was examined to further elucidate the relationship. No significant (p > 0.05) correlation between FKBP5 GE and 5mC was observed at any of the four loci examined: upstream promoter region r = 0.036, p = 0.812; downstream promoter region r = 0.046, p = 0.759; intron 2 r = - 0.063, p = 0.634; intron 7 r = 0.091, p = 0.475.

#### 4. Discussion

Previous studies have highlighted the importance of early life environment in shaping mental health outcomes and have provided evidence that adverse early life experiences can impact 5mC

levels within HPA axis genes. Motivated by this work, we sought to test whether 5mC mediates the relationship between CM and depSS in an adult population. We examined four loci within FKBP5 (upstream promoter, downstream promoter, intron 2, and intron 7); the latter two loci have previously shown CM-associated 5mC differences. Our results suggest 5mC does not mediate the relationship between CM and depSS at any of the four FKBP5 loci examined. However, and confirming a large body of previous research in this area (Harkness and Monroe, 2002; Kessler et al., 1997; MacMillan et al., 2001; Molnar et al., 2001; Wanklyn et al., 2012), a significant effect of exposure to CM on depSS was observed. These results highlight the complex relationship between CM and depression onset, suggesting multiple factors may contribute to disease onset following exposure to CM.

Fig. 4. FKBP5 gene expression levels among individuals with (n = 35) vs. without (n = 36) exposure to childhood maltreatment and participants with (n = 25) vs. without (n = 46) lifetime major depressive disorder history. T-tests showed a significant (p < 0.001) increase in gene expression levels among major depressive disorder cases compared to controls. Error bars represent standard error and asterisk denotes significant p < 0.05.

Further examination of the individual regression analyses of the larger mediation model revealed several surprising findings, the first of which is that we did not detect a significant effect of CM on FKBP5 5mC within intron 7 that has been reported in other studies (Klengel et al., 2013; Tyrka et al., 2015). However, similar to our findings for the promoter region, one previous study reported no significant effect of CM on FKBP5 promoter region 5mC (Klengel et al., 2013). The second surprising finding is that FKBP5 5 mC at any of the 4 loci were not significant predictors of depSS. Several studies have shown altered 5mC levels associated with depressive mood (Kahl et al., 2016; Nantharat et al., 2015; Oberlander et al., 2008; Tyrka et al., 2016). In addition, although the non-significant interaction between CM and genotype (rs1360780) at intron 7 in our data stands in contrast to previous work in adults (Klengel et al., 2013), this finding is consistent with a study in children (Tyrka et al., 2015). Further investigation is needed to elucidate the underlying mechanism between CM and FKBP5 5mC.

As a secondary analysis, we examined the potential significant functional effect of exposure to CM and lifetime MDD on FKBP5 GE levels. No effect of CM exposure was observed on FKBP5 GE levels. This finding is consistent with previous work that examined the biological correlates of PTSD in a longitudinal military cohort on FKBP5 GE and included CM as a covariate (van Zuiden et al., 2012). Examination of FKBP5 GE levels in relation to lifetime MDD, however, revealed a significant increase in expression between those with vs. without a history of the disorder. These findings are consistent with previous studies examining rodent GE of Fkbp5 in relation to chronic stress (Guidotti et al., 2013) or corticosterone exposure (Lee et al., 2010). One human study that compared FKBP5 GE in pre- and post-antidepressant treatment in healthy controls and depressed patients reported increased levels of FKBP5 GE at baseline for the depressed patients compared to the healthy controls (Cattaneo et al., 2013). Potential factors that may contribute to the increase of FKBP5 GE associated with lifetime MDD include cortisol, which may contribute to the observed association between FKBP5 GE and MDD history. Cortisol is released into the bloodstream from the adrenal glands when the HPA axis is activated during stressful events, actual or perceived. Cortisol, when bound to the GR increases transcription of FKBP5 via the ultra-short intracellular feedback loop. High cortisol levels and aberrant HPA axis regulation have been previously implicated in meta-analyses and multiple studies (Belvederi Murri et al., 2014; Dienes et al.,

2013; Stetler and Miller, 2011; Vreeburg et al., 2009), therefore, it is plausible that our study participants with lifetime MDD have altered cortisol sensitivity or HPA axis dysregulation, which contributes to the association between FKBP5 GE and lifetime MDD. Another potential mechanism contributing to this relationship is non-coding RNAs, which can modulate GE (Kaikkonen et al., 2011; Mattick and Makunin, 2006). Although our findings do not directly assess these possibilities, our results do provide additional evidence for the potential functional effect of depression on FKBP5 GE. The potential functional effect of increased GE levels associated with lifetime MDD may result in decreased sensitivity to cortisol, possibly conferring higher GR resistance (Lopez-Duran et al., 2015; Wei et al., 2015). In contrast, the non-significant effect of CM on 5 mC at any of the four loci suggests there is no apparent functional effect of FKBP5 5 mC at these loci on FKBP5 GE levels, at least within the DNHS study population, as evidenced by the correlation analyses. In the present study we report no significant association between CM and 5mC in FKBP5, despite previous reports of an association between these two factors.

One potential reason for our findings, which do not replicate previous work, may pertain to the structure of our study. The population used in this study is drawn from a community-based, population-representative cohort, while the Klengel and Tyrka studies were predominantly comprised of participants from lower socioeconomic status. As such the level and types of trauma and/or contextual stressors experienced by both cases and controls may differ from our own population and impact results. Additionally, it is important to note the average participant age within each study. Similar to our study participants, the Klengel study is comprised of adults, whereas the Tyrka study is comprised of pre-school aged children. Within this study, the average age of DNHS participants was 50.74 years with maltreatment assessed prior to the ages of 11 and 18, resulting in an average of 32 years between exposure to CM and assessment of 5mC. The Klengel study also used the CTQ to assess maltreatment prior to the age of 18, however their population was on average younger than our DNHS participants, 41.46 years, resulting in an average of 22 years between exposure to CM and assessment of 5mC. The Tyrka study, in contrast, included pre-school aged children and relied on child welfare records, rather than self-report, to assess CM. Given this information, the Klengel study is the most comparable to the current study in terms of CM assessment and age at 5mC assessment.

Another potential reason for non-replication may pertain to the difference in the definition of what constituted CM. Selection of CM cases within the Klengel study required histories of both sexual and physical abuse, whereas within this study, selection was based off of exposure levels defined by quartile, with no requirement regarding the type or number of maltreatment types. The Klengel study also reports a significant interaction of childhood trauma and FKBP5 SNP in predicting lifetime PTSD status and modified PTS symptom severity. Additionally, few studies have examined the impact of PTSD on 5mC in FKBP5 (Yehuda et al., 2013) and other HPA axis genes (Labonte et al., 2014; Yehuda et al., 2015b), therefore it is possible that co-morbid lifetime or current PTSD may be driving some of the reported significant findings in the earlier work. As a result, careful interpretation and comparison is required for our own findings as well as those reported by others.

There are study limitations that should be noted. First, the CM variable used in our study is a retrospective self-reported measure of abuses occurring before age 18. Early life experiences have been shown to be long lasting, with effects detected into adulthood, however self-reported measures may introduce recall bias. Previously, retrospective self-reports of CM from adults with documented cases were associated with underreporting of physical and sexual abuse (Widom and Morris, 1997; Widom and Shepard, 1996). Therefore, our measure of CM may well be an underestimate of

previous abuse. Second, the use of self-reported measures may include heterogeneity and variability within the reported participant results for both measures of CM and depression, which may contribute to our reported null findings. Despite this possibility, the CM measure and a similar measure derived from the PHQ-9 for MDD were adequate to detect significant associations in our own previous work (Bustamante et al., 2016). Third, it is possible that our study was underpowered to detect the associations being explored within this work. Nevertheless, we do not believe this to be a likely explanation: the sample size used in this study. N = 112, is between the reported samples sizes for Klengel (N = 76) and Tyrka (N = 174) which both reported significant findings for FKBP5. Moreover, a post-hoc power calculation shows that the sample is adequately powered (86.5%) to detect medium effects sizes as determined by G\*Power (Faul et al., 2009). Fourth, we were unable to control for white blood cell subset within our study; however, we were able to include PBMC counts in each regression model. Notably, there was no significant difference in PBMC counts between participants with vs. without exposure to CM or with vs. without a history of depression. Lastly, we were unable to assess whether our findings were associated with differences in participant cortisol level, as cortisol was not collected within the parent study, the DNHS. Recent work suggests there is a genotype-dependent cortisol response to stress associated with FKBP5 SNP rs1360780 (Buchmann et al., 2014; Fujii et al., 2014; Hohne et al., 2015).

The DNHS is a non-clinical, community-based cohort of adults Detroit, Michigan residents. As such, this study provides us the opportunity to generalize our findings to the larger Detroit population. Second, our study is unique because antidepressant medication use is a covariate in our analyses; inclusion of this variable allows us to adjust for the potential effect of antidepressant medication on 5mC levels as previously reported (Melas et al., 2012; Perisic et al., 2010). Third, this study adds to the literature by examining the relationship among CM, 5mC, depSS, and GE, with additional analyses examining FKBP5 genotype and its potential interaction with CM. Lastly, we measured 5mC and GE in a subset of the same study participants, which allowed us to infer the potential impact of altered 5mC downstream on FKBP5 GE.

In conclusion, we found that 5mC in multiple genomic regions of FKBP5, a regulator of GR sensitivity, does not mediate the relationship between CM and depSS. We also found a significant increase in FKBP5 GE levels associated with lifetime MDD. We did not however, observe any significant difference in relative GE levels related to exposure to CM. Taken together, these results suggest other, additional factors beyond 5mC likely mediate the relationship between CM and depression as detectable in blood. Future studies would benefit from the examination of participant cortisol levels to further assess the implications of altered FKBP5 GE within individuals with a history of MDD. Additionally, examination of 5mC within other regulatory regions of FKBP5 is critical to further understanding the role of FKBP5 in the context of CM and MDD.
